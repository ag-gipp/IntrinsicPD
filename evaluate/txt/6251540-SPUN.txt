The story of "Fun Home" is non-straight and recursive. Episodes are told and re-told in the light of new data or topics. Bechdel depicts the structure of "Fun Home" as a maze, "going over a similar material, however beginning all things considered and spiraling in to the focal point of the story." In an article on diaries and truth in the scholastic diary "PMLA", Nancy K. Mill operator clarifies that as Bechdel returns to scenes and topics "she re-makes recollections in which the power of connection creates the structure of the diary itself." Additionally, the journal gets its structure from implications to different works of writing, Greek legend and visual expressions; the occasions of Bechdel's family life amid her youth and immaturity are exhibited through this insinuating focal point. Mill operator takes note of that the accounts of the referenced scholarly messages "give pieces of information, both genuine and false, to the secrets of family relations." 

The diary centers around Bechdel's family, and is focused on her association with her dad, Bruce. Bruce Bechdel was a memorial service executive and secondary school English instructor in Beech Creek, where Alison and her kin grew up. The book's title originates from the family moniker for the memorial service home, the privately-owned company in which Bruce Bechdel grew up and later worked; the expression likewise alludes amusingly to Bruce Bechdel's domineering local standard. Bruce Bechdel's two occupations are reflected "For no particular reason Home"s center around death and writing. 

In the start of the book, the diary shows Bruce Bechdel's fixation on reestablishing the family's Victorian home. His over the top need to reestablish the house is associated with his enthusiastic separation from his family, which he communicated in chilliness and infrequent episodes of harsh wrath. This passionate separation, thus, is associated with his being a closeted gay. Bruce Bechdel had gay connections in the military and with his secondary school understudies; a portion of those understudies were additionally family companions and sitters. At the age of 44, two weeks after his better half mentioned a separation, he ventured into the way of an approaching Sunbeam Bread truck and was murdered. Despite the fact that the proof is obscure, Alison Bechdel presumes that her dad ended it all.

The journal honestly looks at her sexual improvement, including transcripts from her youth journal, stories about masturbation, and stories of her first sexual encounters with her better half, Joan. Notwithstanding their normal homosexuality, Alison and Bruce Bechdel share over the top urgent inclinations and aesthetic leanings, but with contradicting tasteful faculties: "I was Spartan to my dad's Athenian. Present day to his Victorian. Butch to his nelly. Utilitarian to his person of good taste." This resistance was a wellspring of pressure in their relationship, as both attempted to express their disappointment with their given sexual orientation jobs: "Not exclusively were we reverses, we were reversals of one another. While I was endeavoring to adjust for something unmanly in him, he was endeavoring to express something female through me. It was a war of cross-purposes, thus destined to ceaseless heightening." However, in no time before Bruce Bechdel's demise, he and his little girl have a discussion in which Bruce admits a portion of his sexual history; this is introduced as a fractional goals to the contention among dad and little girl. 

At a few in the book, Bechdel questions whether her choice to turn out as a lesbian was one of the triggers for her dad's suicide.

Bechdel depicts her voyage of finding her own sexuality: "My acknowledgment at nineteen that I was a lesbian happened in a way reliable with my learned childhood." Yet, insights of her sexual introduction emerged from the get-go in her adolescence; she wished "for the privilege to trade [her] swimsuit for some shorts" in Cannes and for her siblings to call her Albert rather than Alison on one outdoors trip. Her dad likewise displayed gay practices, yet the disclosure of this made Bechdel feel uneasy. "I'd been upstaged, downgraded from hero in my very own dramatization to lighthearted element in my folks' catastrophe". Father and girl dealt with their issues in an unexpected way. Bechdel acknowledged the reality, before she had a lesbian relationship, yet her dad concealed his sexuality. He feared turning out, as delineated by "the dread in his eyes" when the discussion subject comes perilously near homosexuality. 

Notwithstanding sexual introduction, the journal addresses the subject of sex character. Bechdel had seen her dad as "a major sissy"" while her dad continually endeavored to change his little girl into a progressively ladylike individual all through her youth.

Also, maybe my cool stylish separation itself accomplishes more to pass on the Arctic atmosphere of our family than a specific scholarly examination." Bechdel, as the storyteller, thinks about her relationship to her dad through the fantasy of Daedalus and Icarus. As a tyke, she confounded her family and their Gothic Revival home with the Addams Family found in the depiction of Charles Addams. Bruce Bechdel's suicide is talked about with reference to Albert Camus' tale "A Happy Death" and exposition "The Myth of Sisyphus". His cautious development of a stylish and scholarly world is contrasted with "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the storyteller proposes that Bruce Bechdel demonstrated components of his life after Fitzgerald's, as depicted in the account "The Far Side of Paradise". His significant other Helen is contrasted and the heroes of the Henry James books "Washington Square" and "The Portrait of a Lady". Helen Bechdel was a novice on-screen character, and plays in which she acted are additionally used to light up parts of her marriage. She met Bruce Bechdel when the two were showing up in a school generation of "The Taming of the Shrew", and Alison Bechdel underwear this was "a harbinger of my folks' later marriage". Helen Bechdel's job as Lady Bracknell in a neighborhood generation of "The Importance of Being Earnest" is appeared some detail; Bruce Bechdel is contrasted and Oscar Wilde. His homosexuality is likewise inspected with suggestion to Marcel Proust's "In Search of Lost Time". The dad and little girl's imaginative and fanatical impulsive inclinations are talked about with reference to E. H. Shepard's representations for "The Wind in the Willows". Bruce and Alison Bechdel trade implies about their sexualities by trading diaries: the dad gives the little girl "Natural Paradise", a personal gathering of the compositions of Colette; in the blink of an eye subsequently, in what Alison Bechdel depicts as "an articulate oblivious signal", she leaves a library duplicate of Kate Millett's journal "Flying" for him.

Bechdel told a questioner for "The Comics Journal" that the lavishness of each board of "Fun Home" was conscious: 

Bechdel composed and showed "Fun Home" over a seven-year time span. Her fastidious masterful procedure made the undertaking of representation moderate. She started each page by making a system in Adobe Illustrator, on which she set the content and drew harsh figures. She utilized broad photograph reference and, for some, boards, modeled for every human figure herself, utilizing an advanced camera to record her stances. Bechdel additionally utilized photograph reference for foundation components. For instance, to represent a board delineating firecrackers seen from a Greenwich Village housetop on July 4, 1976, she utilized Google Images to discover a photo of the New York horizon taken from that specific structure in that period. She additionally carefully duplicated by hand numerous family photos, letters, neighborhood maps and extracts from her very own youth diary, joining these pictures into her account. In the wake of utilizing the reference material to draw a tight structure for the page, Bechdel duplicated the line craftsmanship delineation onto plate complete Bristol board for the last inked page, which she at that point checked into her PC. The dim blue ink wash for each page was drawn on a different page of watercolor paper, and joined with the inked picture utilizing Photoshop.
