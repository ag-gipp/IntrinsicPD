Ellen Maria Colfax 

Ellen Maria Wade Colfax (July 26, 1836 â March 4, 1911) was the second spouse of Schuyler Colfax, who turned into the main House Speaker to be chosen Vice President when he kept running on a ticket headed by Ulysses S. Allow in 1868. She was conceived at Andover, Ohio in 1836. 

On November 18, 1868, only two weeks after the race, Ellen Maria Wade wedded the man who had vanquished her uncle, Senator Benjamin Franklin Wade of Ohio, in the race for the Republican bad habit presidential assignment. They had one child, Schuyler Colfax III, in April 1870. 

Her significant other, Schuyler Colfax was initiated as the seventeenth Vice President on March 4, 1869, and served until March 4, 1873. In like manner, Ellen Maria Colfax turned into the Second Lady of the United States. 

She passed on at her home in South Bend, Indiana in 1911 after a time of weakness, on the 42nd commemoration of her better half's suspicion of the bad habit administration. She was made due by her child Schuyler Colfax III. Her memorial service was held March 7, 1911 at the Colfax home, and she was covered beside her better half.
