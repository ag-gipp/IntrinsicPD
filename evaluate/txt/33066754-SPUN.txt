Philibert Rabezoza (1923 â 29 September 2001), better known by the name Rakoto Frah, was a flute player and arranger of customary music of the focal good countries of Madagascar. Conceived in 1923 close to the capital city of Antananarivo to a poor rustic family, Rakoto Frah surmounted the moves presented by his underprivileged birthplaces to turn into the most acclaimed twentieth century entertainer of the "sodina" woodwind, one of the most seasoned customary instruments on the island. Through continuous universal shows and music celebration exhibitions, he advanced the music of the good countries of Madagascar and wound up a standout amongst the most renowned Malagasy specialists, both inside Madagascar and on the world music scene. 

Subsequent to increasing territorial acknowledgment for his sodina aptitudes as a young, Rakoto Frah rose to national popularity in 1958 when he was chosen by Malagasy President Philibert Tsiranana to perform on the sodina for the meeting French president Charles de Gaulle. This occasion propelled his vocation as an expert artist. He previously played at customary services around the nation, at that point extended his exhibitions from 1967 to incorporate investment in global music rivalries and celebrations. His prominence declined during the 1970s however experienced a restoration that started in the mid-1980s and proceeded until his demise in 2001.

Through the span of his profession he recorded over 800Â original sytheses. Rakoto Frah and his sodina were delineated on the 200 ariary Malagasy banknote out of appreciation for his key job in rejuvenating and universally advancing the sodina. In spite of the craftsman's overall praise, he lived essentially and kicked the bucket having earned little from his lifetime of musicianship. His passing was broadly grieved and set apart by a state burial service, and in 2011 a "famadihana" (the Malagasy good country "turning of the bones" funerary custom) was sorted out to praise the craftsman's life. 

Philibert Rabezoza was conceived in 1923 in Ankadinandriana, a suburb of Antananarivo. His mom was conceived in Antananarivo and his dad, a herder and rancher from Fianarantsoa, had recently been a vocalist at the Merina regal court before the colonization of Madagascar in 1897. Both of Philibert's folks were at that point matured at the season of his introduction to the world and they attempted to think about their new child close by his six siblings and four sisters. As a tyke, Philibert helped his family with caring for the domesticated animals and cultivating their plot of land. In his initial years he was given the moniker Rakoto by a more established sibling of a similar name. 

In the same way as other occupants of the provincial regions in focal Madagascar around then, Rakoto's siblings played the "sodina", an end-blown cylinder generally made of bamboo or reed with three or six finger openings and a thumb gap down its length. One of the most established and most famous melodic instruments in Madagascar, it is accepted to have landed on the island with the soonest pilgrims from Borneo around 2,000 years back and stays across the board all through the focal good countries. Youthful Rakoto started playing the sodina when he was seven years of age. He sharpened his aptitudes by tuning in to town older folks' sodina exhibitions, and after three years the kid framed a little melodic gathering called Ambohijatobe that performed locally at customary merriments. Amid this period Rakoto had the chance to take an interest in a network melodic challenge. His rivals, who performed on accordions and guitars, tossed stones at Rakoto when he ventured forward to perform on the sodina. Regardless of being struck in the face he finished his execution and was granted first prize. In 1935 he was selected by the nearby representative to speak to his region in a national melodic challenge sorted out by the French provincial expert at Mahamasina arena in Antananarivo. That equivalent year Rakoto was stranded at 12 years old, keeping him from further seeking after instruction in light of a legitimate concern for procuring a job. A Frenchman procured the kid to fill in as an associate dough puncher until he became an adult. After achieving adulthood, Rakoto left the bread shop to turn into a metalworker while proceeding to perform on the sodina in melodic gatherings. 

Rakoto's chance for national distinction touched base with the 1958 visit of French President Charles de Gaulle to Madagascar. The visit was related to the disintegration of frontier status and naming of Philibert Tsiranana as Prime Minister, some portion of the island's progress to full freedom in 1960. Tsiranana had recently observed the flute player perform and welcomed Rakoto and his gathering of 18Â musicians to go with de Gaulle and perform customary pieces amid a bit of the French statesman's strolling visit through the capital city of Antananarivo. Following this execution, Rakoto committed himself full-time to a profession in music, performing routinely at conventional festivals on the island. Tsiranana, who progressed toward becoming leader of Madagascar two years after the fact, was the first to allude to the craftsman as Rakoto "Frah", the name that the performer would use for the remainder of his profession. 

Global acknowledgment of Rakoto Frah and his execution of customary sodina music started with his first abroad voyage to Algeria in 1967. The craftsman drove a troupe of 18Â Malagasy performers chose to speak to the island's different ethnic gatherings at the International Festival of Algiers.

The legislature of President Tsirananana fell into disapproval and was upset in 1972, and Rakoto Frah's nearby relationship with the disagreeable previous head of state drove the craftsman to be minimized for the main portion of the organization of his successor, Didier Ratsiraka (1975â 1993). 

In 1985, makers Ben Mandelson and Roger Armstrong visited Madagascar looking for specialists to record for an arranged collection of Malagasy music. Rakoto Frah before long became obvious, and they offered him a full-length collection of his own. Two of Rakoto Frah's granddaughters gave vocals to this collection, which was entitled "Rakoto Frah: Flute Master of Madagascar."

In spite of his prevalence, the craftsman earned almost no from his melodic vocation. This was to some degree because of powerless authorization of copyright laws in Madagascar, which empowered the benefits from unlawfully duplicated collections to go straightforwardly to privateers. All through his vocation as an expert performer he lived in the poor neighborhood of Anatihazo-Isotry in Antananarivo with 30Â members of his family.

The music going with the famadihana reburial services of the focal good countries, for example, is ordinarily performed by an outfit of sodina players joined by the "amponga" drum. These sodina exhibitions, which express the delight of rejoining with the predecessors, are frequently focused. More than one troupe might be available at the famadihana and will alternate flaunting their melodic abilities, with the quick trip of notes expected to rouse moving through the span of the whole day or seven day stretch of the festival. The rustic masterful custom of the "hira gasy" is similarly blissful yet increasingly detailed, displaying the music, move and speech aptitudes of an extensive troupe that incorporates male and female vocalists, drums, sodina, and an assortment of symphonic instruments, for example, clarinets, trumpets and violins.
