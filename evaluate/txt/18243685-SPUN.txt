Oryzomys antillarum 

Oryzomys antillarum, otherwise called the Jamaican rice rodent, is a wiped out rat of Jamaica. An individual from the variety "Oryzomys" inside the family Cricetidae, it is like "O.Â couesi" of territory Central America, from where it might have scattered to its island amid the last cold time frame. "O.Â antillarum" is regular in subfossil cavern faunas and is additionally known from three examples gathered live in the nineteenth century. Some authentic records of Jamaican rodents may relate to it. The species presumably ended up wiped out late in the nineteenth century, maybe because of the presentation of the little Asian mongoose, rivalry with presented rodents, for example, the dark colored rodent, and living space obliteration. 

"Oryzomys antillarum" was a medium-sized rodent, comparative in many regards to "Oryzomys couesi". The head and body length was and the skull was about long. The upperparts were rosy and reviewed into the yellowish underparts. The tail was about as long as the head and body, inadequately haired, and darker above than underneath. The species contrasted from "O.Â couesi" in having longer nasal bones, shorter sharp foramina (holes of the front piece of the sense of taste), and increasingly powerful zygomatic curves (cheekbones). 

In his 1877 monograph on North American rodents, Elliott Coues referenced two examples of "Oryzomys" from Jamaica in the accumulations of the United States National Museum (USNM). As indicated by Coues, the examples were like the swamp rice rodent ("Oryzomys palustris") of the United States, however unique in shading. Despite the fact that he composed that they most likely spoke to a different structure, he shunned giving a logical name to them on account of the likelihood that the structure had officially gotten a name he didn't know about. The species was first formally depicted by Oldfield Thomas in 1898 dependent on an example that had been in the British Museum of Natural History since 1845. He remembered it as a different types of "Oryzomys", "Oryzomys antillarum", however composed that it was identified with the terrain Central American "O.Â couesi". Thomas speculated that the species was at that point wiped out on Jamaica, however that it or a comparative rice rodent could at present be found in the unexplored inside of Cuba or Hispaniola. 

Overhauling North American "Oryzomys" in 1918, Edward Alphonso Goldman held "O.Â antillarum" as a different species, however surrendered that it was so like territory "O.Â couesi" that it might have been presented on Jamaica. In 1920, Harold Anthony detailed that remaining parts of "O.Â antillarum" were regular in beach front caverns, recommending that the species had recently been a vital piece of the eating routine of the stable owl ("Tyto alba"). In 1942, Glover Morrill Allen questioned that it was even an unmistakable animal groups and in his 1962 Ph.D. proposal, Clayton Ray, who analyzed various cavern examples, concurred and held it as just a "pitifully separated subspecies" of "Oryzomys palustris" (which by then included "O.Â couesi" and other Mexican and Central American structures), "Oryzomys palustris antillarum". Philip Hershkovitz arrived at a similar determination in a 1966 paper. After "O.Â couesi" of Mexico and Central America was again delegated an animal types particular from the swamp rice rodent ("O.Â palustris") of the United States, the Jamaican structure came to be viewed as a subspecies of the previous, "Oryzomys couesi antillarum". 

In a 1993 survey, Gary Morgan restored the creature as a particular animal groups firmly identified with "O.Â couesi", refering to an unpublished paper by Humphrey, Setzer, and himself. Fellow Musser and Michael Carleton, composing for the 2005 third release of "Warm blooded animal Species of the World", kept on characterizing the Jamaican structure as a major aspect of "O.Â couesi", however did not reference Morgan. Be that as it may, in a 2006 survey of the substance of "Oryzomys", Marcelo Weksler and associates recorded "O.Â antillarum" as a different species, refering to Morgan, and in a 2009 paper on western Mexican "Oryzomys" Carleton and JoaquÃ­n Arroyo-Cabrales did likewise. 

As indicated by the grouping via Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, "Oryzomys antillarum" is one of eight animal types in the sort "Oryzomys", which happens from the eastern United States ("O.Â palustris") into northwestern South America ("O.Â gorgasi"). "O.Â antillarum" is further piece of the "O.Â couesi" segment, which is focused on the across the board Central American "O.Â couesi" and furthermore incorporates different species with increasingly restricted and fringe appropriations. Numerous parts of the systematics of the "O.Â couesi" segment stay hazy and all things considered, the present order thinks little of the genuine decent variety of the gathering. "Oryzomys" recently included numerous different species, which were logically expelled in different examinations coming full circle in the 2006 paper by Weksler and associates, which avoided in excess of forty species from the family. All are arranged in the clan Oryzomyini ("rice rodents"), a various collection of American rodents of over a hundred animal groups, and on higher ordered dimensions in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, alongside several different types of mostly little rodents. 

"Oryzomys antillarum" was a medium-sized rat, about as vast as "O.Â couesi". As indicated by Thomas' portrayal, the upperparts were rosy, marginally more brilliant on the rear end and progressively grayish on the head. The shade of the upperparts evaluated into that of the underparts, which were yellowish. The hairs of the underparts were grayish at the bases. The little ears were dark on the external and yellow on the internal side and the upper surfaces of the hands and feet were whitish. The tail was almost bare and was light caramel above and lighter beneath. Goldman composed that the examples in the USNM were fairly increasingly rosy, however their shading may have been modified in light of the fact that they had been safeguarded in liquor. Coues had depicted these as corroded dark colored above and washed with a similar shading underneath. Andrew Arata contrasted the USNM examples and instances of the ruddy Florida subspecies of the swamp rice rodent, "Oryzomys palustris natator", for Ray and found that they were more ruddy than even the most emphatically shaded creatures from Florida. 

The skull was commonly like that of "Oryzomys couesi", just like the teeth. It was powerful and bore very much created supraorbital edges (situated over the eyes) on the braincase. The interparietal bone, some portion of the top of the braincase, was little and thin. The hard sense of taste stretched out past the third molars. The nasal bones broadened further back than the premaxillaries, though these bones are as a rule about coterminous in "O.Â couesi". By and large, the sharp foramina, which puncture the front piece of the sense of taste, were shorter than in "O.Â couesi". The zygomatic curve (cheekbone) seems to have been exceptional created in "O.Â antillarum". 

In the three present day and various cavern examples, condylobasal length (a proportion of skull length) changes from (one current and two cavern examples just), length of the hard sense of taste from , width of the interorbital locale (situated between the eyes) from , length of the sharp foramina from , crown length of the upper molars from , and crown length of the lower molars from . 

The most seasoned very much dated record of "Oryzomys antillarum" is at Drum Cave in the Jacksons Bay Caves framework, where it was found in a stratum radiocarbon dated to somewhere in the range of 10,250 and 11,260 years before present as indicated by a recent report. It is available in a few other undated destinations that originate before the human colonization of the island, around 1,400 years before present. In any case, a site (Wallingford Roadside Cave) from the last interglacial, the Eemian, contains just the hystricognath rodents "Clidomys" and "Geocapromys browni" and needs "Oryzomys". The nearness of the rice rodent on Jamaica before the landing of people invalidates the theory that it was presented; rather, it more likely than not achieved the island by overwater dispersal through a boating occasion, presumably under 125,000 years prior. Amid the last frigid period, low ocean levels would have uncovered much land among Jamaica and Central America, significantly diminishing the separation required for the progenitor of "O.Â antillarum" to touch base on the island and presumably affecting ocean flows with the goal that piles of vegetation from Central America would be bound to achieve Jamaica. Types of "Oryzomys" are semiaquatic and intently connected with water, which may clarify the event of the class on Jamaica. The rice rodent has been found in numerous shallow, late Holocene cavern stores, some of which have been radiocarbon dated to inside the most recent 1,100 years. Its remaining parts additionally happen in some Amerindian archeological destinations. From its normal and far reaching event in caverns, Ray recommended that the rice rodent happened in a wide range of environments before European contact. "O.Â antillarum" was the main sigmodontine rat on any of the Greater Antilles, where the rat fauna generally comprises exclusively of hystricognaths and presented rodents. 

Despite the fact that there are some early chronicled records of the rodents of Jamaica, next to no is to be found in them in regards to "Oryzomys antillarum", maybe in light of the fact that the species declined quickly following the European colonization of the island and on the grounds that early creators neglected to recognize it from presented rodents (the dark rodent, "rattus"; darker rodent, "Rattus norvegicus"; and house mouse, "Mus musculus"). Patrick Browne, in the 1756 "Common and Natural History of Jamaica", depicted a "House and Cane-Rat", a "Mouse", and a huge "Water-Rat", which he said had been acquainted with the island and become extremely regular there. 

In his "History of Jamaica" (1774), Edward Long perceived four Jamaican rodents: Browne's "Water-Rat", named the "Charles-value rodent", which Long viewed as indistinguishable with the European water vole ("Arvicola"); the "dark house-rodent", said to have been brought from England; and two he said were indigenous. The bigger of those was a grayish "stick rodent" and the littler was a rosy "field-rodent" as vast as the English mole (the European mole, "Talpa europaea"). Beam thought about that the last may basically have been the house mouse, since the measure of an English mole would be unreasonably little for "Oryzomys". 

In "A Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica" (1851), Philip Henry Gosse recorded the dark and darker rodent and the house mouse, just as the "Stick piece Rat", which he portrayed as "Mus saccharivorus" and viewed as most likely indistinguishable with Browne's "Water-Rat" and Long's "Charles-value Rat". He likewise referenced the two species Long had recorded as indigenous. Thomas and Ray both declared that this "Stick piece Rat" was in all probability a dark colored rodent, as made a decision from its estimations. Gosse composed that an early adventurer, Anthony Robinson, had portrayed and imagined this species in an unpublished original copy, based on an example long, half of which comprised of the tail. Beam was unfit to analyze Robinson's original copy, however proposed that Robinson's rodent couldn't have been the dark colored rodent, since that species did not achieve the Americas until around 1800, and may rather have been "O.Â antillarum". 

Gosse had gathered the British Museum example of "Oryzomys antillarum" in 1845, however might not have isolated it from presented rodents found with it. Coues noticed that the two USNM examples he inspected were gotten after he had composed the previous piece of his monograph; later, Thomas and others composed that these examples were acquired around 1877, yet Ray declared that they were taken before 1874. No examples have been gathered since. 

"Oryzomys antillarum" likely ended up wiped out about the 1870s and is as of now recorded in that capacity by the IUCN Red List. Its vanishing is typically ascribed to the little Asian mongoose ("Herpestes javanicus"), which was acquainted with Jamaica in 1872, and now and again likewise to presented "Rattus" species. Beam, then again, contended that the criticalness of the mongoose had been exaggerated. Rather, he recommended that "Oryzomys antillarum" may have been influenced by the huge ecological changes that happened on the island after the British takeover in 1655. In that period, the majority of the island came to be utilized for development, with the goal that the local natural surroundings of "Oryzomys" was decimated. Hence, "Oryzomys" was diminished to rivalry with presented rodents in man-made natural surroundings, to which the last are all around adjusted. Maybe, Ray composed, the dark rodent might not have had the capacity to extirpate "Oryzomys", however the darker rodent, a later and increasingly self-assured intruder, conveyed it to elimination. Felines and canines going after "Oryzomys" may likewise have added to its downfall.
