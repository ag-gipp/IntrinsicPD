Nigel Kneale 

Thomas Nigel Kneale (18 April 1922Â â 29 October 2006) was a British screenwriter. He composed expertly for over 50 years, was a champ of the Somerset Maugham Award, and was twice selected for the BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay. In 2000, he got the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Horror Writers Association. 

Overwhelmingly an author of spine chillers that utilized sci-fi and ghastliness components, he was best known for the production of the character Professor Bernard Quatermass. Quatermass was a chivalrous researcher who showed up in different TV, film and radio preparations composed by Kneale for the BBC, Hammer Film Productions and Thames Television somewhere in the range of 1953 and 1996. Kneale composed unique contents and effectively adjusted works by authors, for example, George Orwell, John Osborne, H. G. Wells and Susan Hill. 

He was most dynamic in TV, joining BBC Television in 1951; his last content was transmitted on ITV in 1997. Kneale composed generally welcomed TV shows, for example, "The Year of the Sex Olympics" (1968) and "The Stone Tape" (1972) notwithstanding the "Quatermass" serials. He has been depicted as "a standout amongst the most persuasive authors of the twentieth century," and as "having imagined well known TV." 

Kneale was conceived Thomas Nigel Kneale in Barrow-in-Furness, England. His family originated from the Isle of Man, and came back to live there in 1928, when Kneale was six years of age. He was brought up in the island's capital, Douglas, where his dad was the proprietor and manager of the nearby paper, "The Herald". He was instructed at St Ninian's High School, Douglas, and subsequent to leaving examined law, preparing to turn into a promoter at the Manx Bar. He additionally worked in an attorney's office, yet ended up exhausted with his lawful preparing and in the long run relinquished the calling. Toward the start of the Second World War Kneale endeavored to enroll in the British Army, yet was regarded restoratively unfit for administration attributable to photophobia, from which he had endured since adolescence. 

On 25 March 1946 Kneale made his first communicate on BBC Radio, playing out his very own live perusing short story "Tomato Cain" in a strand entitled "Stories by Northern Authors" on the BBC's North of England Home Service locale. Soon thereafter he left the Isle of Man and moved to London, where he started concentrating acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). He made further radio communicates during the 1940s, including a perusing of his story "Zachary Crebbin's Angel" on the BBC Light Program, communicate broadly on 19 May 1948. He likewise had further short stories distributed in magazines, for example, "Argosy" and "The Strand". He started utilizing the name "Nigel Kneale" for these expert credits, however kept on being known as "Tom" to his family and companions up until his passing. 

Subsequent to moving on from RADA, Kneale worked for a brief timeframe as an expert on-screen character performing in little rÃ´les at the Stratford Memorial Theater in Stratford-upon-Avon. He kept on writing in his extra time and in 1949 a gathering of his work, entitled "Tomato Cain and Other Stories", was distributed. The book adequately awed the essayist Elizabeth Bowen that she composed a foreword for it, and in 1950 the accumulation won the Somerset Maugham Award. (His child, Matthew Kneale, would later win a similar honor in 1988 for his novel "Prostitute Banquets".) 

Following this achievement, Kneale surrendered acting to compose full-time. He took little voice-over jobs in a portion of his 1950s TV creations, for example, the voice heard on the production line amplifier framework in "Quatermass II" (1955), for which he likewise described the greater part of the recaps appeared toward the start of every scene. Kneale's distributer was sharp for him to compose a novel, however Kneale himself was increasingly keen on composing for TV. A sharp film goer, he trusted that the gathering of people having the capacity to see human appearances was a critical factor in narrating. 

His first expert content composition credit came when he composed the radio dramatization "The Long Stairs", communicated by the BBC on 1 March 1950 and dependent on a recorded mining calamity on the Isle of Man. In 1951 he was selected as one of the principal staff authors to be utilized by BBC Television; before he began working for the BBC, Kneale had never observed any TV. Kneale was at first a universally useful author, taking a shot at adjustments of books and stage plays and notwithstanding composing material for light diversion and youngsters' projects. The next year, Michael Barry turned into the Head of Drama at BBC Television, and went through his whole first year's content spending plan of Â£250 to employ Kneale as a full-time author for the dramatization division. Kneale's previously credited job in grown-up TV dramatization was giving "extra exchange" for the play "Bolt to the Heart", communicate on 20 July 1952. This play was adjusted and coordinated by the Austrian TV chief Rudolph Cartier, who had additionally joined the staff of the BBC dramatization office in 1952. It was the start of a fruitful working connection between the pair, that would prompt a portion of Kneale's best known work. 

Neither Kneale nor Cartier was awed with the state in which they discovered BBC TV show. At his underlying prospective employee meet-up with Michael Barry, Cartier had condemned the division's yield as being excessively steady and dramatic, while Kneale was disappointed at what he saw as the moderate and exhausting styles of TV show creation at that point utilized, which he felt squandered the capability of the medium. Together they would change British TV show and set up it as a substance separate from its theater and radio reciprocals; the TV history specialist Lez Cooke wrote in 2003 that "Between them, Kneale and Cartier were in charge of acquainting a totally new measurement with TV dramatization in the right on time to mid-1950s." 

Jason Jacobs, a speaker in film and TV learns at the University of Warwick, wrote in his 2000 history of early British TV dramatization that "It was the entry of Nigel KnealeÂ ... what's more, Rudolph CartierÂ ... that tested the cozy show directlyÂ ... Kneale and Cartier shared a typical want to animate TV with a quicker rhythm and a more extensive topical and spatial canvas, and it was no occurrence that they swung to sci-fi so as to escape the predominant complex pattern of TV closeness." 

The sci-fi creation to which Jacobs alluded was "The Quatermass Experiment", communicate in six half-hour scenes in July and August 1953. The sequential recounted to the narrative of Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group, and the results of his sending the principal kept an eye on mission into space when an awful destiny comes to pass for the team and just a single returns. "The Quatermass Experiment" was the principal grown-up TV sci-fi generation, held a substantial TV crowd grasped over its a month and a half, and has been depicted by the Museum of Broadcast Communications as sensationalizing "another scope of gendered fears about Britain's after war and post-provincial security." Kneale was roused in picking the character's irregular surname by the way that numerous Manx surnames started with "Qu"; the real name itself was picked from a London phone index. The Professor's first name was picked out of appreciation for the space expert Bernard Lovell. 

The BBC perceived the accomplishment of the sequential, especially with regards to the approaching entry of business TV to the UK. Controller of Programs Cecil McGivern wrote in a reminder that: "Had focused TV been in presence at that point, we would have killed it each Saturday night while ["The Quatermass Experiment"] kept going. We are going to require "some" more 'Quatermass Experiment' programs." Like the majority of Kneale's TV work for the BBC during the 1950s, "The Quatermass Experiment" was transmitted live. Just the initial two scenes were telerecorded and make due in the BBC's documents. 

Kneale and Cartier next worked together on an adjustment of "Wuthering Heights" (communicate 6 December 1953) and after that on an adaptation of George Orwell's tale "Nineteen Eighty-Four" (12 December 1954). "Nineteen Eighty-Four" was an especially striking generation; many thought that it was stunning, and questions were gotten some information about whether a portion of the scenes had been reasonable for TV. There was likewise conspicuous help for the play; the Duke of Edinburgh made it realized that he and the Queen had watched and delighted in the program, and the second live execution on 16 December picked up the biggest TV gathering of people since her crowning ritual the earlier year. "The Guardian" paper's eulogy of Kneale in 2006 asserted that the adjustment had "forever resuscitated Orwell's notoriety," while the British Film Institute included it in their rundown of the 100 Greatest British Television Programs of the twentieth century in 2000. 

"The Creature"â a unique content by Kneale concerning the legend of the terrible snowmanâwas his next joint effort with Cartier, communicate on 30 January 1955, trailed by an adjustment of Peter Ustinov's play "The Moment of Truth" (10 March 1955), preceding Kneale was appointed to express "Quatermass II". Explicitly structured by the BBC to battle the risk of the new ITV organize, which propelled only a month prior "Quatermass II" was appeared, sequential was significantly more effective than the principal, attracting groups of onlookers of up to nine million watchers. Kneale was motivated recorded as a hard copy the sequential by contemporary apprehensions over mystery UK Ministry of Defense explore foundations, for example, Porton Down, also the way that as a BBC staff author he had been required to sign the Official Secrets Act. 

Simultaneously with the transmission of "Quatermass II" in the pre-winter of 1955, Hammer Film Productions discharged "The Quatermass Xperiment", their film adjustment of the primary sequential. Kneale was not satisfied with the film, and especially hated the giving of Brian Donlevy a role as Quatermass, as he clarified in a 1986 meeting. "[Donlevy] was then truly on the slides and couldn't have cared less what he was doing. He took almost no enthusiasm for the creation of the movies or in filling the role. It was an instance of take the cash and run. Or on the other hand on account of Mr Donlevy, waddle." 

"Quatermass II" was Kneale's last unique content for the BBC as a staff essayist. He left the partnership when his agreement terminated toward the finish of 1956; "Five years in that hovel was as much as any rational individual could stand," he later told a questioner. Be that as it may, he kept on composing for the BBC on an independent premise. 

That year that he left the BBC, Kneale composed his first element movie screenplay, adjusting "Quatermass II" for Hammer Film Productions alongside maker Anthony Hinds and chief Val Guest. Hinds and Guest had regulated the first "Quatermass" film, whereupon Kneale had been unfit to work because of his BBC staff contract. Kneale was baffled that Brian Donlevy likewise returned in the job of Quatermass. The movie debuted toward the finish of May 1957, and was checked on emphatically in "The Times": "The author of the first story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the executive, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the correct speed, without deviations. The film has a demeanor of regard for the issues addressed, and this impression is affirmed by the acting by and large." 1957 likewise observed the arrival of another true to life cooperation among Kneale and Guest, when Kneale adjusted his 1955 BBC play "The Creature" into "The Abominable Snowman"; for this situation, Hammer held the star of the BBC form, Peter Cushing. 

In May 1957, Kneale was shrunk by the BBC to compose a third "Quatermass" sequential, and this was in the end transmitted as "Quatermass and the Pit" crosswise over about a month and a half in December 1958 and January 1959. On this event Kneale was propelled by the racial pressures that had as of late been found in the United Kingdom, and which reached a critical stage while the sequential was in pre-creation when the Notting Hill race riots happened in August and September 1958. Attracting gatherings of people of up to 11 million, "Quatermass and the Pit" has been alluded to by the BBC's own site as "basically the primary best thing the BBC at any point made." It was likewise incorporated into the British Film Institute's "television 100" list in 2000, where it was commended for the subjects and subtexts it investigated. "In a story which mined folklore and folkloreÂ ... under the appearance of classification it handled genuine subjects of man's antagonistic nature and the military's depravity of science for its own finishes." 

Regardless of the accomplishment of the sequential, Kneale felt that he had now taken the character of Quatermass to the extent he could. "I would not like to continue rehashing in light of the fact that Professor Quatermass had officially spared the world from extreme demolition multiple times, and that appeared to me to be sufficiently very," he said in 1986. It was additionally his last new cooperation with Rudolph Cartier, despite the fact that the chief did later deal with another rendition of Kneale's 1953 adjustment of "Wuthering Heights" for the BBC in 1962. 

In 1958, Kneale's play "Mrs Wickens in the Fall", transmitted by the BBC the earlier year, was changed by the CBS organize in the United States, retitled "The Littlest Enemy". Communicate on 18 June as a major aspect of "The United States Steel Hour" treasury arrangement, the content was seriously decreased long. It was Kneale's solitary inclusion with American TV, and he was not satisfied with the outcome. "I decided I could never under any circumstance again have anything done on a broadcasting company in America," he later remarked. 

For the following couple of years, Kneale focused for the most part on film screenplays, adjusting plays and books for the film. Depicted by "The Independent" as "one of only a handful couple of journalists not to drop out with John Osborne," Kneale adjusted Osborne's plays "Think Back in Anger" and "The Entertainer" in 1958 and 1960 individually, both for chief Tony Richardson. Kneale knew Richardson through having recently adjusted a Chekhov short story for the BBC, which Richardson had coordinated. Kneale was assigned for the British Film Award (later known as a BAFTA) for Best Screenplay for the two movies. Film maker Harry Saltzman, who had delivered the two Osborne adjustments, drew nearer Kneale about scripting a venture he was taking a shot at to adjust Ian Fleming's James Bond books for the film; Kneale was not an aficionado of Fleming's work and turned the idea down. Further adjustments Kneale worked on were "H.M.S. Rebellious" (1962, from the novel "Revolt" by Frank Tilsley) and "First Men in the Moon" (1964, from the novel by H. G. Wells). 

Less effectively amid this period, Kneale finished screenplays for adjustments of the books "Master of the Flies" by William Golding and "Daring of-the-art existence" by Aldous Huxley. Neither of these contents at any point considered generation, to be the organizations making them left businessâKneale remarked in a 2003 meeting that "I figure I shut down somewhere around two film organizations." Another screenplay that went unproduced was a Kneale unique, a show including an influx of adolescent suicides called "The Big Giggle", or "The Big, Big Giggle". Written in 1965 while Kneale was experiencing a puzzle sickness and compelled to remain in bed for a significant lot, the idea began life as a dramatization sequential for the BBC, before the enterprise had apprehensions about the idea of the storyline and the likelihood of copycat suicides; Kneale later concurred that they were presumably right not to make it for TV. The creation was about made as a film by twentieth Century Fox, however John Trevelyan, Chief Executive of the British Board of Film Censors, precluded the content's generation. 

In 1966 Kneale worked again for Hammer Film Productions when he adjusted Norah Lofts' 1960 novel "The Devil's Own" into the blood and guts movie "The Witches". Kneale had first dealt with the screenplay for the adjustment in 1961, that year in which he had started to adjust "Quatermass and the Pit" for Hammer. Like "The Witches", the film rendition of "Quatermass and the Pit" took quite a long while to achieve the screen, in the end being discharged in 1967. Roy Ward Baker coordinated, with Andrew Keir featuring as Quatermass. Kneale was a lot more joyful with this rendition than the past Hammer Quatermass adjustments, and the film was portrayed by "The Independent" in 2006 as "a standout amongst the best ever Hammer preparations." "Quatermass and the Pit" was Kneale's last credited film work; 1979's "The Quatermass Conclusion" was just discharged to films in abroad markets in the wake of having been made for TV in the UK, and he had his name expelled from the credits of "" (1982). 

Kneale had come back to composing for TV with the BBC out of the blue since "Quatermass and the Pit" when his play "The Road" was communicated in September 1963. The play concerned the number of inhabitants in an eighteenth century town who become frequented by dreams of a future atomic war, and was trailed by a few further irregular dramatizations for the BBC over the next decade, including two passages into BBC1's "The Wednesday Play" collection strand. Amid this period he was viewed as one of the best scholars working for the BBC. Kneale did his first work for the ITV organize amid this time, keeping in touch with irregular play "The Crunch" for the ATV organization in 1964. 

A specific basic achievement was "The Year of the Sex Olympics", communicate as a major aspect of BBC2's "Theater 625" arrangement in July 1968. Kneale's first TV work to be made in shadingâalbeit just a high contrast duplicate currently enduresâthe story was situated in a future where most of the populace are kept in a mild state by consistent communicates of erotic entertainment and other tasteless unscripted tv programming. "The Live Life Show", in which a family are watched twenty-four hours per day as they battle to live on a secluded provincial island, turns into a monstrous achievement, particularly when a killer is brought into the set-up. 

"The Year of the Sex Olympics" has been adulated for its foretelling of the ascent of unscripted tv projects, for example, "Elder sibling" (1999â present) and "Big name Love Island" (2005â 2006). The commentator Nancy Banks-Smith wrote in 2003 that: "In "The Year of the Sex Olympics" [Kneale] predicted the unscripted TV drama and, in the scramble for more prominent sensation, its intelligent outcomeÂ ... This is parody from a TV insider, however it changes into something undeniably progressively ruined and disorientating." The island areas scenes for the creation were recorded on the Isle of Man, Kneale's country. 

In 1965 Kneale had been drawn nearer by the maker of the BBC2 sci-fi treasury arrangement "Out of the Unknown" to discount another one 75-minute "Quatermass" story for the program. Nothing happened to this, however after seven years he was charged by the BBC to compose another four-section "Quatermass" sequential, situated in a tragic not so distant future world overwhelm with wrongdoing, aloofness, military law and youth cliques. The sequential was declared as an anticipated creation by the BBC in November 1972, and some model shooting was even started in June 1973, however in the long run budgetary issues and the inaccessibility of Stonehengeâa focal area in the contentsâprompted the task's dropping. "It waited through the mid year and gradually kicked the bucket as a task," he later remarked. 

Kneale's next content for the BBC was "The Stone Tape", a logical phantom story communicate on Christmas Day 1972. Lez Cooke commended the creation, when writing in 2003, depicting it as "a standout amongst the most innovative and savvy instances of the frightfulness sort to show up on British TV, a solitary play to rank nearby the best of "Play for Today"." His last BBC work was a passage into an arrangement called "Sleep time Stories", adjusting conventional fantasies into grown-up dramatizations. Kneale's content, "Jack and the Beanstalk", was transmitted on 24 March 1974, and denoted the finish of his BBC composing profession. 

Kneale's outstanding TV work was composed for ITV. His first content for ITV in this period was the coincidental play "Murrain", made by the system's Midlands establishment holders Associated TeleVision (ATV) in 1975. The play, a repulsiveness piece based around black magic, drove the next year to an arrangement called "Brutes", a six-section compilation where Kneale made six diverse character-based stories of frightfulness and the grim. It included some outstanding performers, for example, Martin Shaw, Pauline Quirke and Bernard Horsfall, however did not pick up a full system keep running on ITV; diverse locales transmitted the scenes in various timeslots and some in various successions. 

In the mid-1970s, Kneale made his solitary endeavor at composing a phase play. Called "Crow", it depended on the diaries of genuine Manx slave owner Captain Hugh Crow. Kneale was unfit to discover sponsorship to create the play for the stage, yet sold the content to ATV who place it into pre-generation for TV. Notwithstanding, in a matter of seconds before taping it was dropped by request of ATV's overseeing chief, Lew GradeâKneale was never explained why. 

Following the wiping out of "Crow", Kneale moved to work for one more of the ITV organizations, Thames Television, who in 1977 appointed the creation of the contents of Kneale's recently deserted fourth "Quatermass" sequential, to be delivered by their Euston Films backup film organization. The creation was organized to work both as a four-scene sequential for transmission in the UK, and a 100-minute film variant for film discharge abroadâsomething Kneale later lamented consenting to. Featuring John Mills as Quatermass and with a financial plan of over Â£1 millionâin excess of multiple times the financial plan of "Quatermass and the Pit" in 1958âthe sequential was not as fundamentally fruitful as its forerunners. "Specifically no less marvelous than Mr Kneale's prior sci-fi papers for BBC Television, his ITV debut has demonstrated just a so-so issue," was the decision of "The Times" while reviewing the last scene. Tying in with the arrangement, Kneale came back to writing fiction when he composed his solitary full-length novel, "Quatermass", a novelisation of the sequential. 

Kneale's next TV arrangement was a takeoff from his standard styleâ"Kinvig", his sole endeavor at composing a sitcom, delivered by London Weekend Television and communicate on ITV in the harvest time of 1981. Despite the fact that his initially absolute parody, Kneale was quick to stretch that there had dependably been components of cleverness present all through his contents, and a portion of the press response to "Kinvig" was sure. "On the off chance that you like the possibility of the "Drifter's Guide" yet discovered its acknowledgment tediously crazy you may well incline toward Kneale's casual mind. Cast impressive, bearing deft," was "The Times'" review of the main scene. Be that as it may, the arrangement was not a triumph, in spite of the fact that Kneale later remained actually satisfied with it. 

In 1982, Kneale made another off redirection from his standard work when he composed his just created Hollywood film content, "". Kneale had at first been drawn closer by the executive John Landis to deal with the screenplay for a change of "Animal from the Black Lagoon", and he and his significant other invested some energy living at the Sheraton Hotel in Hollywood while Kneale chipped away at the task. The "Dark Lagoon" content never went into creation, yet while in America Kneale met the chief Joe Dante, who welcomed him to content the third film in the "Halloween" arrangement, on which Dante was working. Kneale concurred, on the stipulation that it would be an absolutely new idea irrelevant to the initial two movies, which he had not seen and he didn't care for what he had caught wind of them. 

Kneale's treatment for the film met with the endorsement of John Carpenter, the maker of the "Halloween" arrangement, despite the fact that Kneale was required to compose the content in just a month and a half. Kneale jumped on well with the executive allocated to the film, Tommy Lee Wallace, however when one of the film's supporters, Dino De Laurentiis, demanded the incorporation of progressively realistic brutality and a rework of the content from Wallace, Kneale ended up disappointed with the outcomes and had his name expelled from the film. 

He came back to composing contents for British TV, including "Upper class" with Roger Daltrey for ITV in 1987, and the 1989 adjustment of Susan Hill's epic "The Woman dressed in Black" for transmission on ITV on Christmas Eve. Lynne Truss, checking on a recurrent communicate of the generation on Channel 4 for "The Times" in 1994, composed that: "Clasp clop isn't generally a clamor to get furious about. Be that as it may, it will be an intriguing test, today, to go up behind individuals and murmur 'cut clop', to see if they saw "The Woman dressed in Black" the previous evening. Individuals who settled on the striking choice to watch this incredible show will react to any 'cut clop' by gratifyingly jumping noticeable all around and snatching the backs of their necks." The adjustment about went unmade; Kneale had composed the content in ten days however been prompted by his specialist to hold up before submitting it to the makers Central Independent Television with the goal that they would not think he had surged it. When he submitted the content three weeks after the fact, he found that Central had been going to drop the creation as they had expected that Kneale, at that point 67, had not had the capacity to finish the work because of his age. 

Susan Hill herself disliked a portion of the progressions that Kneale had made to "The Woman dressed in Black". It has been seen that Kneale on certain events worked a twofold standard with adjustments; being despondent when others made changes to his accounts, however ready to make changes to stories he was adjusting into content structure. Alluding to "The Woman dressed in Black" adjustment, the author and commentator Kim Newman noticed that: "He was affronted at the thought of Susan Hill utilizing the name of Kipps from HG Wells as the saint of "The Woman dressed in Black", thus he chose not to utilize it and to change the legend's name to Kidd. I'm certain in the event that someone suspected that Quatermass was a senseless name and transformed it, he'd be irate!" However, Kneale's adjustments were in no way, shape or form constantly disliked with the first creator. In 1991, a four-section form he composed of Kingsley Amis' tale "Stanley and the Women", met with endorsement from the first creator, with Amis viewing it as the best adjustment of any of his work. 

Kneale likewise adjusted "Sharpe's Gold" for ITV in 1995, as a major aspect of their arrangement of adjustments of Bernard Cornwell's "Sharpe" books. This was a task that amazed his specialist; "We would not think he'd like to waste time with them yet he did. That was most likely on the grounds that he loved the maker." He came back to composing for radio out of the blue since the 1950s in 1996, when he composed the show narrative "The Quatermass Memoirs" for BBC Radio 3. Somewhat made out of Kneale glancing back at the occasions that prompted the composition of the first three "Quatermass" serials and utilizing some file material, there was likewise a performed strand to the arrangement, set just before the ITV "Quatermass" sequential and including Andrew Keir, star of the Hammer adaptation of "Quatermass and the Pit", as the Professor. 

While recording a sound analysis for that film in 1997, Kneale theorized about a conceivable "Quatermass" prequel set in 1930s Germany. As per "The Independent", Kneale considered a storyline including the youthful Quatermass getting to be engaged with German rocketry explores during the 1930s, and helping a youthful Jewish lady to get away from the nation amid the 1936 Berlin Olympics. 

Kneale was welcome to compose for the effective American sci-fi arrangement "The X-Files" (1993â 2002), however declined the offer. His last proficient work was a scene of the ITV lawful show "Kavanagh QC", featuring John Thaw. Kneale's scene, "Old History", was about a Jewish lady who amid the Second World War had been exposed to terrible investigations in a death camp. Transmitted on 17 January 1997 and refered to as one of the program's best scenes, it concluded Kneale's composition vocation after over fifty years. 

He kept on showing up as a meeting subject in different TV documentaries, and furthermore recorded further sound analyses for the arrival of a portion of his creations on DVD. In 2005, he went about as a specialist when the advanced TV slot BBC Four delivered a live revamp of "The Quatermass Experiment". He lived in Barnes, London, until his passing on 29 October 2006 at 84 years old, after a progression of little strokes. 

The essayist and performing artist Mark Gatiss, paying tribute to Kneale on the BBC News Online site soon after his passing, demonstrated that he was among the principal rank of British TV scholars, however this had been neglected. "He is among the greatsâhe is completely as vital as Dennis Potter, as David Mercer, as Alan Bleasdale, as Alan Bennett, yet I think in light of the fact that about a bizarre gaudiness about dream or science fiction it's never fully been that way." Similarly, his tribute in "The Guardian" remarked that: Kneale was in no way, shape or form the main creator to have been to a great extent squandered by TV, and to have seen his status overwhelmed by cleanser musical drama hacks. Be that as it may, his place is secure, close by Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, John Wyndham and Brian Aldiss, as a standout amongst the best, most energizing and most caring English sci-fi essayists of his century. 

Expounding on "The Year of the Sex Olympics" in 2003, Nancy Banks-Smith felt that Kneale was one of only a handful couple of TV scholars whose work was especially critical. Quite a long time ago, Lord Hailsham, continuing to the council of the House in dark leggings and full-bottomed wig as Lord High Chancellor, recognized a companion and cried robuslyt, "Neil!" They state an entire gathering of American voyagers tumbled to their knees. At the name of Kneale, I feel, each knee should bow. The amount TV do you recollect from last nightÂ ... last yearÂ ... a century ago? Very. Inquisitively, I can recollect unmistakably the first occasion when I saw "The Year of the Sex Olympics" by Nigel Kneale. It was 35 years prior. 

Kneale was respected by the movie chief John Carpenter, who procured Kneale to compose the screenplay "Halloween III". Woodworker composed the screenplay for his 1987 film "Ruler of Darkness" under the pen name "Quatermass", a reference to Kneale's work. The loathsomeness fiction essayist Stephen King has refered to Kneale as an impact, and Kim Newman recommended in 2003 that King had "pretty much changed "Quatermass and the Pit" in "The Tommyknockers"." Other authors have acclaimed Kneale as an effect on their work including funnies author Grant Morrison and TV screenwriter Russell T Davies, who portrayed the "Monsters" scene "Infant" as "the most startling thing I've ever seenÂ ... Incredible stuff." Film screenwriter and executive Dan O'Bannon was additionally an admirer of Kneale's composition, and in 1993 composed a potential revamp of "The Quatermass Experiment", of which Kneale affirmed, however the film was never made. 

Prominent media outlet figures have freely communicated adoration for Kneale's work, including The Beatles' drummer Ringo Starr, individuals from the stone gathering Pink Floyd and "Monty Python's Flying Circus" essayist/entertainer Michael Palin. 

Kneale never considered himself to be a sci-fi essayist, and was frequently incredulous of the class. He especially despised the BBC arrangement "Specialist Who" (1963â 89; 1996; 2005â present), for which he had once turned down an idea to compose. "It sounded a horrendous thought regardless I think it was," he remarked in 1986. "The way that it's kept going quite a while and has an enduring gathering of people doesn't mean much. So has "Intersection" and that is a stinker". He likewise reprimanded "Blake's 7", which he depicted as the absolute bottom of British TV sci-fi: "I figure the depressed spot for me would be the not many bits I've seen of a thing called "Blake's 7" which I found paralytically horrendous. The exchange/characterisation appeared to comprise of a sort of immature quarreling" and "Doomwatch": "I was drawn nearer to state "Doomwatch". That didn't appear to be much good either." "Specialist Who" was vigorously impacted by Kneale's "Quatermass" serials, at times notwithstanding utilizing explicit storylines that were fundamentally the same as those from "Quatermass". 

In a January 2015, BBC Radio 2 gave a meeting with Hammer Films CEO Simon Oaks with updates on building up another Quatermass arrangement for TV.
