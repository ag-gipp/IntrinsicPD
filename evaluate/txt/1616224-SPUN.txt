From 1990 to 1996, she was the leader of Saint Catharine College close Springfield, Kentucky. The 1993 conviction of Collins' significant other, Dr. Bill Collins, in an impact selling outrage, harmed her expectations for an arrival to political life.

The couple wound up dynamic in a few metro associations, including the Jaycees and Jayceettes and the Young Democratic Couples Club. Through the club, they took a shot at sake of Henry Ward's ineffective gubernatorial crusade in 1967. 

By 1971, Collins was the leader of the Jayceettes; through her work there, she went to the consideration of Democratic state congressperson Walter "Dee" Huddleston. Huddleston asked Collins to co-seat Wendell Ford's gubernatorial crusade in the sixth District. J.R. Mill operator, at that point director of the state Democratic Party, remarked that "She sorted out that area like you wouldn't trust." After Ford's triumph, he named Collins as a Democratic National Committeewoman from Kentucky. She quit her showing work and got down to business full-time at the state Democratic Party central command, as secretary of the state Democratic gathering and as an agent to the 1972 Democratic National Convention.

The Woodford County part of Business and Professional Women picked Collins as its 1976 Woman of Achievement, and in 1977, Governor Julian Carroll named her Kentucky Executive Director of the Friendship Force. 

In a field that included six noteworthy hopefuls, Collins verified the Democratic assignment for lieutenant senator in the 1979 essential, gathering 23 percent of the vote. She helpfully crushed Republican Hal Rogers in the general decision 543,176 to 316,798. As lieutenant representative, she ventured to every part of the state, going to services instead of Democratic Governor John Y. Dark colored, Jr., who detested such formal occasions and frequently decided not to visit. Before the finish of her term, she pronounced that she had visited every one of the 120 provinces in Kentucky. Representative Brown was every now and again out of the state, leaving Collins as acting senator for over 500 days of her four-year term. 

As lieutenant representative, Collins directed the state Senate. Individuals from both real gatherings applauded Collins for her unprejudiced nature and learning of parliamentary method in this job. She was twice called upon to break tie cast a ballot in the Senate, once on a bill enabling the state's educators to participate in aggregate dealing and another on a bill to permit branch banking crosswise over area lines inside the state; in the two cases she casted a ballot in the negative, slaughtering the bill. Amid her residency, she additionally led the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors, turning into the principal lady to hold that position.

Collins had the help of numerous pioneers in the Democratic Party, however just before the essential, Governor Brown embraced Stumbo, charging that both Sloane and Collins would utilize their gubernatorial arrangement capacity to apportion party support. Despite the fact that this was a typical practice at the time, Brown prominently disregarded it amid his term. With 223,692 votes, Collins pushed out Sloane (219,160 votes) and Stumbo (199,795 votes) to verify the selection. Sloane requested a recanvass of the votes, at the end of the day chose it would not change the result and surrendered rout. 

In the general race, Collins confronted Republican state congressperson Jim Bunning, who was later chosen to the Baseball Hall of Fame for his accomplishments as an expert pitcher . The National Organization for Women, the National Women's Campaign Fund, and the Women's Political Caucus all would not embrace Collins, refering to her tepid help for the Equal Rights Amendment and her restriction to fetus removal aside from in instances of assault, inbreeding, or when the mother's life was in peril. In any case, Bunning was not amiable on the battle field and experienced issues discovering issues that would attract generally Democratic voters to him. His Catholicism was a political risk among the greater part Protestant voters. Collins won the decision by a vote of 561,674 to 454,650, turning into the first, and to date just, lady to be chosen legislative head of Kentucky. 

Following her race, Collins gave the surplus $242,000 from her battle coffers to the state Democratic Party. At the point when Collins' better half was named state treasurer for the partyÂ â at a yearly pay of $59,900Â â the state press charged that the move was a plot to pipe Collins' battle assets into her own record. (The past Democratic state treasurer had gotten no compensation amid his residency.) Following the media analysis, Dr. Collins surrendered his post as treasurer. The majority of the included people demanded that Governor Collins had not been advised on the subtleties of her significant other's arrangement. The media's analysis of Collins proceeded the same number of the arrangements to her official bureau went to what they described as unpracticed faculty who had held key positions in her past crusades. At the point when recently selected Insurance Commissioner Gilbert McCarty endorsed a 17% rate increment mentioned by Blue Cross Blue ShieldÂ â a solicitation that his antecedent had denied a couple of days earlierÂ â Collins immediately revoked the endorsement pending a formal proceeding on the issue. 

In her first location to the governing body, Collins requested an extra $324Â million from the Kentucky General Assembly, its vast majority allotted for training. The extra income was to be gotten from Collins' proposed expense bundle, which included expanding the salary charge on people making more than $15,000 yearly, stretching out the business assessment to cover administrations, for example, auto fix and cleaning, and expanding the corporate permitting charge. After resistance to her proposition created among lawmakers amid the 1984 biennial administrative session, Collins reexamined the expense bundle. She held the corporate permitting charge increment, yet supplanted the business assessment and pay charge alterations with a level five percent individual salary charge and eliminating the derivations for deterioration which enterprises could guarantee on their state charges. 

With the state as yet recuperating from a monetary subsidence and a decision year forthcoming, officials would not raise charges. Collins in the long run pulled back her solicitation and presented a continuation spending plan. Some instruction proposition pushed by Collins were passed, including obligatory kindergarten, healing projects for primary younger students, required testing and temporary position for educators, and the execution of scholastic receivership for failing to meet expectations schools. Among different achievements of the 1984 authoritative session were entry of a harder smashed driving law, and a measure permitting state banking organizations to buy different banks inside the state. 

By prudence of her race as Kentucky's representative, Collins turned into the most elevated positioning Democratic lady in the country. The main two ladies in the U.S. Senate at the time were Republicans, and Collins was the main lady legislative leader of any state. Soon after her race, she showed up on "Great Morning America", where she was gotten some information about her enthusiasm for the bad habit administration and gave a wary answer. Four days after her introduction as representative, she was picked to convey the Democratic reaction to President Ronald Reagan's week by week radio location. At a news meeting following her discourse, Collins was inquired as to whether she would be considered as the Democrats' bad habit presidential hopeful in the forthcoming decision; she answered "Actually no, not right now." 

In mid-1984, the Democratic National Committee picked Collins to direct the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. This commitment kept Collins from leading the state assignment to the tradition, as was run of the mill of governors. The gathering named Collins' child, Steve as state seat. Preceding the tradition, Walter Mondale, the hypothetical presidential chosen one, talked with Collins as a conceivable bad habit presidential applicant before picking Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate. An author for "The Miami Herald" later opined, in light of meetings with Mondale guides, that Collins was never given genuine thought by Mondale. He revealed that she was incorporated into his rundown of potential running mates principally to dull potential charges of "tokenism" in thinking about other ladies and minorities. 

In January 1985, Collins restored her push for extra instruction subsidizing and changes by designating herself secretary of the state Education and Humanities Cabinet. Following the declaration, Collins and a few key administrators held a progression of gatherings in each district, pushing for her proposed changes and looking for data about what sorts of changes the state's natives wanted. At the gatherings, Collins was mindful so as to isolate the issues of her proposed instruction plan and potential expense increments. She trusted that resistance to expanded charges had kept her past bundle from being instituted. 

Collins declared another instruction bundle in June 1985 that incorporated a five percent no matter how you look at it increase in salary for educators, a decrease in class sizes, subsidizing for development ventures, associates for each kindergarten instructor in the state, and a "control evening out" program to make financing for less fortunate school regions increasingly equivalent to that of their progressively well-to-do partners. After great response to the arrangement from officials, she called a unique authoritative session to gather July 8 to think about the arrangement. Following two weeks of consultation, the General Assembly affirmed Collins' instruction plan, tripling the corporate authorizing expense to $2.10 per $1,000 so as to pay for the bundle. The Assembly dismissed a proposed five-pennies per-gallon increment in the state gas expense to back other spending. 

Collins followed up her accomplishment in the 1985 exceptional session with a push for progressively advanced education subsidizing in the 1986 authoritative session. Legislators obliged by favoring an extra $100Â million for advanced education in the biennial spending plan. They likewise endorsed usage of a pilot preschool program and the buy of new perusing course readings, yet neglected to follow up on Collins' solicitation for an extra $3.9Â million to improve the state's professional instruction framework. Administrators endorsed calling a submission on a sacred amendmentÂ â bolstered by CollinsÂ â to make the state director of instruction a selective, instead of elective, office. The alteration was vanquished by the state's voters in November 1986, in spite of a Collins-drove battle for it. The expanded corporate expense proposed to take care of the expense of the expanded training spending plan was, in any case, deficient. In 1987, an arrangement to expand income through changes in the state pay charge was deserted when Wallace Wilkinson, the Democratic gubernatorial chosen one who might proceed to succeed Collins, reported his resistance to it. 

In March 1985, Collins left on the first of a few exchange missions to Japan. She returned there in October 1985, and furthermore visited ChinaÂ â a first for any Kentucky governorÂ â to empower opening Chinese markets for Kentucky merchandise and to set up a "sister state" association with China's Jiangxi territory. Collins' endeavors in Japan yielded her most critical achievement as governorÂ â persuading Toyota to find a $800 million assembling plant in Georgetown. As indicated by distributed reports, the Kentucky area was picked over proposed destinations in Indiana, Missouri, Tennessee, and Kansas. 

The concurrence with Toyota was dependent upon authoritative endorsement of $125Â million in motivating forces guaranteed to Toyota by Collins and state Commerce Secretary Carroll Knicely. They included $35Â million to purchase and improve a tract to be given to Toyota for the plant, $33Â million for starting preparing of representatives, $10Â million for an abilities advancement place for workers, and $47Â million in interstate upgrades close to the site. The impetus bundle was endorsed in the 1986 authoritative session. State Attorney General David L. Armstrong communicated worries that the impetuses may struggle with the state constitution by giving blessings from the state treasury to a private business, yet presumed that the General Assembly had made "a great confidence exertion to be in consistence with the constitution". 

Given Armstrong's worries, the organization utilized general guidance J. Patrick Abell to document a neighborly experiment to decide the defendability of the motivator bundle. While the suit was pending, the "Lexington Herald-Leader" announced that the organization had neglected to incorporate the enthusiasm on the securities used to back the consumptions in its estimation of the cost; this, in addition to the cost invades revealed by the "Envoy Leader", had just driven the all out expense of the bundle to about $354Â million by late September 1986. In October, Toyota consented to take care of the expense overwhelms related with setting up the site for development. 

Rivals of the monetary allures for Toyota joined the state's test suit. In October 1986, Franklin County Circuit Court Judge Ray Corns issued an underlying decision that the bundle did not disregard the state constitution, however the two sides asked the Kentucky Supreme Court to settle on a ultimate choice. On June 11, 1987, the Kentucky Supreme Court decided 4â 3 that the bundle filled an open need and were accordingly protected. 

Soon after the declaration that Toyota was moving to Georgetown, Martha Lane Collins, inside her ability as Governor denounced a bit of land having a place with land engineer Gordon Taub. Taub possessed 60 sections of land inside the Toyota plant site and 4.2 sections of land were sentenced to manufacture a four-path roadway to the Toyota plant entrance. Taub tested the judgment expressing that the Commonwealth did not reserve the option to censure private property for the utilization of a "revenue driven", open company. At preliminary, Martha Lane Collins turned into the principal sitting legislative leader of Kentucky to affirm in court.She was spoken to by previous senator, Bert T. Brushes, Taub was spoken to by previous senator Louis B. Nunn; this was likewise the first run through in the historical backdrop of Kentucky that two previous governors spoke to contradicting parties in a legitimate activity. 

Afterward, Toyota set up a few gathering plants over the state; close to the finish of Collins' term, the state Commerce Cabinet revealed that 25 car related assembling plants had been developed in 17 regions since the Toyota declaration. 

In 1987, Collins guaranteed $10Â million in state help to Ford to boost the organization to extend its truck get together plant in Louisville. The state experienced record work development under Collins' monetary advancement plan, which included endeavors to pull in both household and universal organizations. The state's joblessness rate tumbled from 9.7 percent in October 1983 to 7.2 percent in October 1987; as indicated by the organization's own figures, they made a net increment of 73,000 occupations in the state amid Collins' residency. 

On October 7, 1987, Collins called an extraordinary administrative session to close a deficiency between state commitments to the laborer's remuneration Special Fund and distributions. The Special Fund was assigned for installments to laborers with word related ailments and laborers whose business related wounds couldn't be followed to any single manager. An arrangement proposed by Democratic state congressperson Ed O'Daniel was relied upon to give the system to enactment considered in the session. Under O'Daniel's arrangement, extra income for the Special Fund would be raised by expanding appraisals on laborer's pay premiums for a long time. Evaluations for coal organizations were expanded more than those on different organizations on the grounds that most of the cases paid from the Special Fund were for dark lung, a breathing malady normal among coal excavators; thus, it was contradicted by administrators from vigorously coal-subordinate regions. By the by, following nine days of dealings, a bill generously like O'Daniel's unique arrangement was affirmed by the governing body and marked by Collins. 

Collins led the Tennesseeâ Tombigbee Waterway Authority and held that position when the conduit opened to general society in 1985.

In 1988, she acknowledged a situation as "official in home" at the University of Louisville, giving visitor addresses to understudies in the college's business classes. She additionally began a worldwide exchange counseling firm in Lexington. At the point when Western Kentucky University president Kern Alexander surrendered to acknowledge a situation at Virginia Tech in 1988, Collins was among four finalists to succeed him. Some employees openly communicated worries about Collins' absence of involvement in the scholarly world, and she pulled back her name from thought presently before the new president was reported. 

In the wake of satisfying her one-year promise to the University of Louisville, Collins was named an individual of the Harvard Institute of Politics' John F. Kennedy School of Government, instructing non-credit classes on authority styles once every week. Simultaneous with her situation at Harvard, Collins was named to the leading body of officials for Midway College in 1989; the next year, she was expelled from the leading group of officials of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.

In 1990, Collins acknowledged the administration of Saint Catharine College in Springfield, Kentucky, turning into the primary leader of the little, Catholic school who was not a Dominican sister. School authorities expressed that Collins was enrolled for the administration to raise the school's profile. 

In 1993, Collins' significant other, Bill, was charged in an impact hawking embarrassment. The arraignment asserted that while Collins was senator, Dr. Collins misused a discernment that he could impact the granting of state contracts through his significant other.

Collins was additionally supposed to think about running for the U.S. Senate, an offer which never emerged following her significant other's conviction. The Collinses rejoined following Dr. Collins' discharge from jail on October 10, 1997.
