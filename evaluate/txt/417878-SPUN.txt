It is an adjustment of the 1951 banner utilized while the nation was a republic of the Soviet Union. Changes made to the Soviet-time banner were the evacuation of images of socialism (the sledge and sickle and the red star) and the inversion of the shades of the trimming design, from white-on-red to red-on-white. Since the 1995 choice, a few banners utilized by Belarusian government authorities and organizations have been displayed on this national banner.

The essential plan of the national banner of Belarus was first portrayed in Presidential Decree No.214 of June 7, 1995. The banner is a rectangular material comprising of two even stripes: a red upper stripe covering 66% of the banner's stature, and green lower stripe covering 33%. A vertical red-on-white Belarusian beautifying design, which involves one-ninth of the banner's length, is set against the flagstaff. The banner's proportion of width to length is 1:2. 

The banner does not vary essentially from the banner of the Byelorussian SSR, other than the evacuation of the mallet and sickle and the red star, and the inversion of red and white in the derrick design. While there is no official elucidation for the shades of the banner, a clarification given by President Alexander Lukashenko is that red speaks to opportunity and the penance of the country's ancestors, while green speaks to life. 

Notwithstanding the 1995 pronouncement, "STB 911â 2008: National Flag of the Republic of Belarus" was distributed by the State Committee for Standardization of the Republic of Belarus in 2008. It gives the specialized particulars of the national banner, for example, the subtleties of the hues and the trimming design. The red adornment structure on the national banner was, until 2012, the width of the banner, and with the white edge. Starting at 2012, the red example has involved the entire of the white edge (which remained at ). 

The shades of the national banner are managed in "STB 911â 2008: National Flag of the Republic of Belarus" and are recorded in the CIE Standard illuminant D65. 

An embellishing design, planned in 1917 by Matrona Markevich, is shown on the derrick of the banner (as it was beforehand, on the 1951 banner). The example, got from neighborhood plants and blooms, is a conventional sort regularly utilized in Belarus. These examples are now and again utilized in woven pieces of clothing, in particular in the conventional "ruchnik", a woven material utilized for formal occasions like religious administrations, burial services, and other increasingly unremarkable social capacities, for example, a host offering visitors bread and salt served on a rushnyk. 

The spouse of Matrona Markevich was captured for against Soviet purposeful publicity and executed amid Soviet restraint in Belarus in 1937, after which the family was dekulakized. The first "ruchnik" has not endure and was either reallocated by the NKVD in 1937 or annihilated amid the Second World War. The sibling of Matrona Markevich, Mikhail Katsar, leader of the ethnography and legends office at the Academy of Sciences of Belarus, was incorporated into the commission that was arranged to make another banner for the Belarusian SSR in 1951. 

A landmark to Matrona Markevich was raised in Sianno in 2015. 

By law, the Belarusian banner ought to be flown every day, assuming the rainclouds blow over, from the accompanying areas: 

The Belarusian banner is likewise authoritatively flown on the locales of uncommon events: 

Belarusian ambassadors and different government authorities, (for example, the President and the Prime Minister) show the banner on vehicles. The law takes into consideration the banner to be utilized for unique events, for example, remembrance administrations and family occasions, and it tends to be utilized by different gatherings of individuals, for example, open associations, organizations, and NGOs. The guidelines were issued in a similar announcement that characterized the Belarusian banner. May 15 has been announced the Day of the National Emblem and Flag of Belarus (, ). The national banner itself has been consolidated into the identification of the gatekeeper units in the Belarusian military. The shaft ought to be multiple times longer than the width of the banner. 

As per the 1995 presidential pronouncement, the national banner is to be utilized on a staff that is hued gold (ochre). Different pieces of the convention indicate the finial (the metal trimming on a banner post) as precious stone formed and hued in a yellow metal. In this precious stone there is a five-pointed star (like that utilized in national insignia). The precious stone example speaks to another continuation of Soviet banner customs. 

The banner of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic was embraced by pronouncement on December 25, 1951. The banner was somewhat altered in 1956 when development subtleties were included for the red star, and brilliant mallet and sickle. The last details of the banner was set in Article 120 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR and are fundamentally the same as the present Belarusian banner. The banner had a length-to-width proportion of one to two (1:2), simply like the banner of the Soviet Union (and the other fourteen association republics). The principle segment of the banner was red (speaking to the Revolution), with the rest being green (speaking to the Belarusian timberlands). An example of white drawn on red enlivened the derrick part of the banner; this structure is regularly utilized on Belarusian conventional ensembles. In the upper corner of the banner, in the red bit, a gold sledge and sickle was included, with a red star sketched out in gold above it. The mallet spoke to the specialist, and the sickle the worker; as per Soviet belief system, these two images crossed together symbolized co-task between the two classes. The red star, an image normally utilized by Communist gatherings, was said to stand either for the five social gatherings (specialists, youth, laborers, military, and scholastics), the five known mainlands, or the five fingers of the laborer's hand. The sledge, sickle and star were at times not shown on the turn around of the banner. The reason for this plan was that the Byelorussian SSR, alongside the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR, were admitted to the United Nations in 1945 as establishing individuals and required unmistakable banners for one another. The creator of the banner was Milkahil Gusyev. 

Prior to 1951, a few unique banners had been being used since the Revolution. The soonest banner was plain red, and was utilized in 1919 amid the presence of the Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. After the development of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering Ð¡ÑÑÐ± (SSRB) was included gold to the top lift. This plan was set up with the entry of the primary Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later adjusted in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to ÐÑÑÑ (BSSR) however kept the general structure the equivalent. This structure was changed in 1937, when a mallet and sickle and red star were put over the letters. The banner measurements were additionally formally settled as 1:2 out of the blue. This banner stayed being used until the selection of the 1951 banner, which got rid of the letters. 

The structure of the banner utilized between 19 September 1991 and 5 June 1995 had initially been contrived by the Belarusian People's Republic (March to December 1918). The first individual behind the structure of the banner is accepted to have been Klaudzi Duzh-Dusheuski before 1917 and this plan is referred to in Belarusian as the "" (; actually "white-red-white banner"). Red and white have generally been utilized in state heraldry of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polishâ Lithuanian Commonwealth. The hues are additionally founded on those of the crest Pahonia that was a customary escutcheon of Belarusian terrains and had a white horseman on a red foundation. There are a few different hypotheses clarifying the banner's beginning. One hypothesis discusses a reference to the name of the nation: White Ruthenia. 

Somewhere in the range of 1921 and 1939 the white-red-white banner was utilized by the Belarusian national development in West Belarus (some portion of the Second Polish Republic), both by political associations like the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union or the Belarusian Christian Democracy, and non-political associations like the Belarusian Schools Society. The banner was likewise utilized by the Belarusian Special Battalion in the military of the Republic of Lithuania. After the intrusion of Poland and the addition of advanced West Belarus in 1939 the banner was illegal by the Soviet organization in the recently obtained regions too. 

In 1941 the banner was took into consideration utilization by the Nazi occupation organization, and it showed up on arm patches of Belarusian volunteers in the German Army and Waffen SS and was utilized by the Belarusian Central Rada, the professional German administration of Belarus in 1943â 1944. After the finish of World War II the banner was utilized by Belarusian diaspora in the West and by little gatherings of hostile to Soviet obstruction in Belarus itself. In late 1980s the banner was again utilized as an image of national restoration and law based changes in Belarus. By proposition of the Belarusian Popular Front the banner progressed toward becoming state image of Belarus upon its recapturing of freedom in 1991. 

After 1995 the white-red-white banner is utilized as an image of the resistance to the routine of Alexander Lukashenko, most remarkably at the dissents after the 2006 and 2010 presidential decisions and at mass arouses on Freedom Day festivities just as Dziady remembrance walks. The banner isn't formally prohibited from open utilization, yet is treated by the specialists as an "unregistered image" which implies that showing of it by political activists or sports fans can prompt captures and seizure of the banners. In mid 2010, the political extremist Siarhei Kavalenka was captured for putting the white-red-white banner on a Christmas tree on the focal square of Vitsebsk. The court allowed Kavalenka three years of suspended sentence which was trailed by a second capture and Kavalenka's few weeks in length hunger strike. The yearning strike was hindered by coercively feeding on 16 January 2012. 

The submission that was held to receive the state images occurred on May 14, 1995. With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new banner was endorsed by a greater part in the proportion of three to one (75.1% to 24.9%). The other three inquiries were likewise passed by the voters. The method for completing the submission just as the legitimateness of scrutinizing the national images on a choice was intensely condemned by the restriction. Resistance groups guaranteed that just 48.7% of the whole casting a ballot populace (75.1% of the 64.7% who appeared at the surveying stations) upheld the selection of the new banner, however Belarusian law (as in numerous different nations) expresses that just a dominant part of voters is expected to settle on a choice issue. Upon the outcomes going for President Lukashenko, he declared that the arrival of the Soviet-style banner brought a feeling of youth and charming recollections to the country. 

Lukashenko had endeavored to hold a comparable submission previously, in 1993, however neglected to get parliamentary help. Two months before the May 1995 submission, Lukashenko proposed a banner plan that comprised of two little bars of green and one wide bar of red. While it isn't recognized what happened to this recommendation, new structures (called "ventures" in Belarus) were proposed a couple of days after the fact, which were then set up to cast a ballot in the 1995 submission. 

Since the presentation of the 1995 banner, a few different banners received by government offices or bodies have been displayed on it. 

The presidential standard, which has been being used since 1997, was embraced by a declaration called "Concerning the Standard of the President of Republic of Belarus". The standard's structure is a precise of the national banner, with the expansion of the Belarusian national image in gold and red. The standard's proportion of 5:6 contrasts from that of the national banner, making the standard practically square. It is utilized at structures and on vehicles to indicate the nearness of the president. 

In 2001, President Lukashenko issued a declaration allowing a banner to the Armed Forces of Belarus. The banner, which has a proportion of 1:1.7, has the national fancy example along the length of the crane side of the banner. On the facade of the banner is the Belarusian crest, with the wording Ð£Ð·Ð±ÑÐ¾ÐµÐ½ÑÑ Ð¡ÑÐ»Ñ ("Armed Forces") angled over it, and Ð ÑÑÐ¿ÑÐ±Ð»ÑÐºÑ ÐÐµÐ»Ð°ÑÑÑÑ ("of Republic of Belarus") composed beneath; the content of both is in gold. On the turn around of the banner, the middle contains the image of the military, which is a red star encompassed by a wreath of oak and shrub. Over the image is the expression ÐÐ° ÐÐ°ÑÑ Ð Ð°Ð´Ð·ÑÐ¼Ñ ("For our Motherland"), while underneath is the full name of the military unit.
