Ward's first silent novel was of 1929. Ward was increasingly goal-oriented with his second work in the medium: the characters are more nuanced, the plot progressively created and confused, and the shock at social bad form increasingly unequivocal.

Ward came back to the United States and outsourced his representations. In New York City in 1929, he went over the silent novel "Fate" (1926) by German craftsman Otto NÃ¼ckel (1888â 1955). NÃ¼ckel's solitary work in the class, "Fate" recounted the life and demise of a whore in a style enlivened by Masereel's, however with a more noteworthy true to life stream. The work roused Ward to make his very own silent novel: "" (1929). In his second such work, "Crazy person's Drum", he would have liked to investigate all the more profoundly the capability of the account medium, and to beat what he saw as an absence of singularity in the characters in .

"Maniac's Drum" is a more aggressive work than "Divine beings' Man", with a bigger cast of characters and progressively confounded plot. The book is increasingly express in its far-radical legislative issues, and incorporates a subplot in which the principle character's sister's socialist sweetheart is executed for his political convictions. Late in life Ward depicted it as "set a hundred years or more agoÂ ... in a clearly outside land", yet that the story's circumstance and characters could be experienced "anyplace whenever". 

The workmanship has an assortment of line characteristics and surfaces, and more detail than in "Divine beings' Man".

The accomplishment of Ward's initial two silent books drove American distributers to put out various such books, including NÃ¼ckel's "Predetermination" in 1930, just as books by Americans and different Europeans. Enthusiasm for silent books was fleeting, and few other than Masereel and Ward created in excess of a solitary work. Every one of Ward's sold less duplicates than the last, and he surrendered the class in 1940 in the wake of relinquishing an endeavor at a seventh. In 1943 analyst Henry Murray utilized two pictures from "Crazy person's Drum" in his Thematic Apperception Test of identity attributes. 

A commentator for "The Burlington Magazine" in 1931 made a decision about the book a fizzled test, finding the work of art uneven and the story difficult to pursue without even the part titles as literary direction that "" had. Visual artist Art Spiegelman considered Ward's second silent novel a "sophomore droop", whose story was impeded by Ward's endeavor to substance out the characters and produce a progressively entangled plot. He trusted the work of art was a blend of qualities and shortcomings: it had more grounded organizations, however the more finely engraved pictures were "more diligently to peruse", and the passing of the spouse and other plot indicates were vague and troublesome decipher. Spiegelman considered Ward to have broken free from this droop by streamlining his work in his next silent novel, "Wild Pilgrimage" (1932).
