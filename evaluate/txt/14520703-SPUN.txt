In the opening quarter of the diversion, the Eagles took a 7â 0 lead on a 51-yard bumble return for a touchdown.

Virginia Tech replied with their very own touchdown, however Boston College reacted with a seven-play, 74-yard touchdown drive of its own. At that point came maybe the most urgent play of the diversion. Amid the additional point kick following the Boston College touchdown, Virginia Tech's Duane Brown obstructed the kick, which was gotten by the Hokies' cornerback Brandon Flowers, who returned it 75Â yards for a guarded two-point change.

The ACC Championship Game matches the victor of the Coastal and Atlantic Divisions of the Atlantic Coast Conference. A meeting title amusement was included 2005, because of the alliance's extension the earlier year, including previous Big East individuals Miami, Virginia Tech, and Boston College. With the expansion of Boston College, the ACC comprised of 12Â teams, enabling it to hold a meeting title amusement under NCAA rules. 

Florida State crushed Virginia Tech, 27â 22 in the main ACC Championship amusement. The next year, the diversion, held in Jacksonville, Florida, set Wake Forest against Georgia Tech, with Wake Forest winning 9â 6. Before the 2007 season started, most games journalists and surveyors anticipated that Florida State would win the Atlantic Division while Virginia Tech would win the Coastal Division, setting up a rematch of the 2005 ACC Championship Game. 

In October, Florida State lost consecutive ACC meeting recreations to Wake Forest and Miami, disposing of them from conflict for their division title. Boston College, which had completed second in the preseason Atlantic Division survey, was positioned No.Â 2 in the nation after Florida State's misfortune to Miami. Virginia Tech, which endured a 48â 7 rout on account of then-No.Â 2 LSU, all things considered stayed at the highest point of the Coastal Division standings as the Eagles passed the Seminoles for the Atlantic Division lead. 

On October 25, Boston College headed out to Blacksburg, Virginia, home of Virginia Tech, for a Thursday night amusement communicate on ESPN. In substantial downpour, Virginia Tech's barrier ruled for the vast majority of the amusement. As time kept running down, be that as it may, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan organized twoÂ late-diversion touchdown drives, scoring 14Â points in the last 2Â minutes to win 14â 10. The triumph apparently fixed Boston College's course to a national title diversion, while the misfortune conceivably imperiled Virginia Tech's odds of being chosen to play in the ACC Championship Game. Throughout the following two weeks, nonetheless, Boston College was angry with Florida State and Maryland. The Eagles revitalized to win their last two amusementsâagainst Miami and Clemsonâto secure the division title. Virginia Tech, in the mean time, was undefeated through the rest of its calendar, including a division-securing prevail upon its archrival, Virginia. This implied the ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville would be a rematch between these two division champions. 

In the weeks paving the way to the amusement, there was much media dialog of things to come site of the diversion because of Jacksonville's lapsing contract to have the ACC Championship. The media additionally talked about whether Virginia Tech would be out for retribution against Boston College after its very late thrashing in Blacksburg on October 25. In spite of its past misfortune, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win, with most supporting the Hokies by 4.5â 5Â points. 

The diversion was the fifteenth challenge between Boston College and Virginia Tech and was their second of the 2007 season. The primary gathering, which occurred in 1993 in the Big East meeting, brought about a 48â 34 Boston College win. Somewhere in the range of 1993 and 2003, Boston College and Virginia Tech had every year as influence of their gathering plans. The groups did not meet in 2004 after Virginia Tech's turn to the Atlantic Coast Conference. At the point when Boston College followed in 2005, the schools continued gathering amid the ordinary season, playing in 2005, 2006, and 2007. 

Following the 2006 ACC Championship Game, the Gator Bowl Association, which directed the ACC Championship Game amid its initial two years of presence, was granted a one-year expansion to its two-year contract to have the amusement. The 2006 diversion experienced poor participation, bringing about over $1Â million in misfortunes for the Gator Bowl Association. In the off-season, the Gator Bowl Association pronounced that if deals did not improve for the 2007 ACC Championship diversion, the amusement's Jacksonville future would be in peril. Participation for the 2006 diversion was low because of high travel costs originating from Jacksonville's separation from the partaking schools, and the 2007 membersâBoston College and Virginia Techâconfronted a similar issue. 

With Jacksonville's future as host in uncertainty, agents from Charlotte, North Carolina, Tampa, Florida, and Jacksonville visited the ACC workplaces to anteroom to have the 2008 amusement. Orlando, Florida, which had been an early contender to have the 2008 diversion, was disposed of from thought before the gatherings occurred. As kickoff moved nearer, the Gator Bowl Association communicated dismay with the poor ticket deals, saying that almost 20,000Â tickets stayed unsold as of the seven day stretch of the amusement and that on the off chance that it was anything but a sellout, the diversion would likely not stay in Jacksonville. 

Media consideration was likewise aimed at the groups' hostile abilities. Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in the week paving the way to the diversion. In the primary portion of the 2007 season, Ryan had been noticeably referenced in competitor records for the Heisman Trophy, school football's most astounding individual honor. In spite of the fact that Ryan's late-diversion rebound in their past amusement against Virginia Tech had made him a leader, the group's two resulting misfortunes to unranked groups dropped him from conflict for the Heisman. Phenomenal exhibitions in a division-securing succeed at Clemson and against Miami appeared to return Ryan to Heisman-hopeful structure, in any case, and heading into the ACC Championship Game, Ryan had all the earmarks of being the greatest hostile risk for Boston College. 

Virginia Tech's offense was driven by an unordinary two-quarterback framework, as junior Sean Glennon imparted time to rookie Tyrod Taylor. While Glennon ended up being a superior pocket passer, Taylor's snappiness empowered him to scramble out of inconvenience and increase positive yardage notwithstanding when no open recipients were accessible for passes. Until the last round of the period, either Taylor or Glennon was hampered by damage and restricted the two-quarterback framework's adequacy. In spite of the fact that the two-quarterback framework demonstrated powerful against Virginia, there were still inquiries regarding how well such a surprising setup would work in the ACC Championship Game. 

On the ground, Taylor's hostile scrambling, while compelling, was not Virginia Tech's essential hurrying weapon. Running back Brandon Ore, Virginia Tech's starter at the position, would need a decent diversion, investigators anticipated, if the Hokies needed to win. Mineral, who endured a few wounds amid the 2006 season, neglected to create significant hostile yardage until late in the season, disillusioning numerous fans who trusted he would rehash his magnificent 2006Â performance on the field. With a 146-yard act against Virginia in the last round of the ordinary season, Ore appeared to have recaptured his 2006Â form and guaranteed achievement in the ACC Championship Game. 

The Boston College ground offense was driven by running back Andre Callender, who had maybe his greatest round of the year amid the division-securing match against Clemson two weeks sooner. In that diversion, Callender completed with 75Â rushingÂ yards. Because of the achievement of Matt Ryan's passing assault, be that as it may, Callender was utilized generally as a backfield collector and was the group's driving beneficiary measurably amid the 2007Â season. In the standard season, Callender amassed 905Â yards hurrying, 613Â yards accepting, and 13Â total touchdowns. Callender's typical reinforcement, running back A.J. Streams, was suspended for the ACC Championship Game. 

Virginia Tech's resistance was viewed as more grounded than that of Boston College. For the ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech returned senior linebacker Vince Hall to the beginning lineup. Corridor had sat out four straight recreations, including the past Boston College coordinate, subsequent to enduring a broken lower arm and wrist. ESPN named Hall and Xavier Adibi, Tech's other senior linebacker, the "best linebacker couple in the nation". 

On Virginia Tech's cautious auxiliary, Brandon Flowers, one of Tech's beginning cornerbacks, was a second-group All-ACC protective determination and had fiveÂ interceptions in the season. Helping Flowers would be Victor "Macho" Harris, who had likewise gotten fiveÂ interceptions amid the normal season. Amid the 2007Â season, Sports Illustrated called the two "possibly the best cornerback couple in America." 

Toward the finish of the normal season, Boston College was positioned 26th broadly in complete protection, and second broadly in run guard. Its pass protection, be that as it may, was positioned 106th in the nation, and since Boston College was without senior cornerback DeJuan Tribble, who was recuperating from a sprained knee tendon, it was normal that the Eagles' linebackers would need to play a decent amusement to stop Virginia Tech's passing offense. Jo-Lonn Dunbar, who had been named to the preseason watch list for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy (granted to the top protective player in the nation) was required to fill the holes and stop both surging and passing components of Virginia Tech's offense. 

What's more, wellbeing Jamie Silva would need to play a solid amusement to help the Boston College cornerback supplanting the harmed Tribble. Silva, an All-ACC cautious determination, drove the group with five capture attempts and was great in climbing to stop the keep running too. On edge line, cautious end Nick Larkin was a quarterfinalist for the Lott Trophy, an honor given to the protective player with the most "guarded effect" broadly.

After poor participation in the ACC Championship Game at Jacksonville for the second in a row year, ACC authorities and agents of the meeting's part schools chose not to broaden the Gator Bowl Association's agreement to have the diversion.
