He included that the diversion experienced unbalanced viciousness, disappointing battling groupings, absence of online play, and "soak expectation to absorb information". Hodgson contrasted the center mechanics with a "scaled down amusement taking on the appearance of games diversion". William Racer of the "Official Xbox Magazine" ("OXM") commended the quick paced nature of the diversion and its eye for detail, and grumbled about the camera points and trouble.

"GameSpot" Greg Kasavin talked exceedingly of the tight controls and available ongoing interaction despite a bigger expectation to absorb information. IGN's Goldstein portrayed the controls as "moderately straightforward" and straightforward inside a solitary diversion, and Scott Osborne of "GameSpy" found the controls unbalanced yet effectively learned. In correlation, Charles Herold of "The New York Times" and a companion couldn't make sense of Blitz's principles for 20 minutes, feeling "excessively macho" to do the instructional exercise. "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" Jonathan Silver idea the ongoing interaction was excessively excited, as ""NHL Hitz" on steroids". Hilary Goldstein of IGN's solitary grievance about the controls was the camera's detachment.

While Kasavin of "GameSpot" thought the topic was worn out, "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution" Oxford composed that the diversion felt "new". Pondering the discharge year, IGN chief Peer Schneider said that amusements like "Deathrow" demonstrated the diversions business' capacity to make new, high-bore establishments. Two IGN staff members anticipated the amusement to be a sleeper hit: one noticed the inadequate press contrasted with the diversion's quality, and the other clarified that Ubisoft was caught up with advancing greater titles, for example, "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell", "", and "Rayman".

In March 2004, IGN recorded "Deathrow 2" as one of its five wanted Xbox continuations, explicitly for Xbox Live online play support. IGN put its odds at a 90% probability. IGN announced a month later that regardless of enthusiasm from Southend, Ubisoft would be probably not going to discharge a prospective "Deathrow" spin-off because of the first's low income.
