Persona, otherwise called Shin Megami Tensei: Persona, is a computer game establishment created and principally distributed by Atlus. Centering around a progression of pretending computer games, "Persona" is a turn off from Atlus' "Megami Tensei" establishment, and was initially founded on the secondary school setting of "Shin Megami Tensei If...".

Since the arrival of "Persona 3" in 2006, the fundamental arrangement has utilized a social recreation work called Social Links, which is legitimately connected to how Personas develop. Focal character plans are by arrangement co-maker Kazuma Kaneko ("Persona" and the "Persona 2" duology) and Shigenori Soejima ("Persona 3" onwards). Its general topic is investigation of the human mind and how the characters locate their actual selves. The arrangement's common ideas and plan components draw on Jungian brain research and models, alongside religion, folklore, and mainstream writing. 

"Disclosures: Persona" was the main pretending "Megami Tensei" title to be discharged outside of Japan. Starting with "", the English restrictions started to stay unwavering to the Japanese renditions at the request of Atlus. The arrangement is exceedingly mainstream globally, turning into the best-known "Megami Tensei" turn off and building up Atlus and the "Megami Tensei" establishment in North America. Following the arrival of "Persona 3" and "4", the arrangement additionally settled a solid following in Europe. The arrangement has since proceeded to sell an aggregate of more than nine million duplicates around the world, beating its parent establishment. There have been various adjustments, including anime TV and showy arrangement, novelizations, mangas, organize plays, radio dramatizations, and melodic shows. 

"Persona 3" got a Japan-select turn off web based diversion titled it pursues a comparative cycle of daytime exercises and evening time battle as the first amusement, with one player being picked as the gathering chief every night. After its conclusion in 2008, another allowed to-play program amusement titled was discharged that year; the ongoing interaction concentrated on players combining Personas and standing up to a risk known as the Qliphoth. Remaining selective to Japan, it shut down in June 2010. A battling diversion continuation of "Persona 4", "Persona 4 Arena", was discharged in arcades in Japan in 2012. Comfort forms were discharged in 2012 in Japan and North America, and 2013 in Europe. A spin-off, "Persona 4 Arena Ultimax", was correspondingly discharged in Japanese arcades in 2013, at that point discharged in 2014 in all districts for consoles. An independent turn off for the Nintendo 3DS, "", was discharged worldwide in 2014; it includes the full throws of "Persona 3" and "4", and is classed by Atlus as an official passage in the "Persona" ordinance. A continuation including the "Persona 5" cast is underway. A cadence diversion set after the occasions of "Persona 4 Arena Ultimax", "", was discharged worldwide in 2015. Two subsequent meet-ups to "Moving All Night", "" and "", were at the same time discharged in Japan in May 2018. 

A few "Persona" portable diversions have been made in association with other Japanese versatile organizations, for example, Bbmf. Their first organization was in 2006 with the advancement and arrival of a 3D prison crawler set inside the situations of the principal "Persona" diversion. The organizations later teamed up on two portable recreations dependent on the "Persona 2" diversions: in 2007, and in 2009. The two amusements persisted the fundamental interactivity elements of the first recreations custom fitted for cell phones. Numerous portable turn offs are identified with "Persona 3": there is a RPG side-story titled an activity diversion prequel set ten years preceding "Persona 3" titled and a substitute form of "Persona 3" highlighting distinctive characters titled Multiple "Persona 3"- themed perplex recreations have additionally been created. An online portable RPG set around the secondary school included in "Persona 3", titled was discharged in 2009. "Persona 4" in like manner got a versatile card diversion turn off, titled 

The interactivity of the "Persona" arrangement rotates around battle against different foe types: Demons, Shadows and Personas. Fundamental battle happens amid prison creeping portions inside different areas. The manner in which fights start fluctuates between irregular experiences ("Persona", "Persona 2") or running into models speaking to foe gatherings ("Persona 3" onwards). Fights are administered by a turn-based framework, where the player gathering and adversaries each assault the contradicting side. Activities in fight incorporate standard physical assaults utilizing short-run skirmish or long-extend shot weapons, supernatural assaults, utilizing things, guarding, and under specific conditions getting away from fights. Amid fight, either side can strike a foe's shortcoming, which bargains more harm than different assaults. Beginning with "Persona 3", getting a basic hit allows the character an additional turn. On the off chance that all adversaries are thumped somewhere near basic hits, the gathering can play out a "Full scale Attack", with all gathering individuals assaulting without a moment's delay and managing high harm. Each gathering part is physically constrained by the player in everything except one "Persona" title: in "Persona 3", all the gathering separated from the primary character are constrained by an AI-based direction framework. The general interactivity has stayed reliable over all "Persona" amusements. 

Every "Persona" amusement likewise incorporates novel components. In "Persona", fights happen on a network based front line, with characters' and adversaries' developments directed by their arrangement on the combat zone. This framework was relinquished for the "Persona 2" amusements: the gathering has free development over the front line, and is doled out a lot of moves which can be changed in the menu amid and in the middle of fights. In "Persona" and "Persona 3", there is a lunar stage attached to ongoing interaction, time movement, and the plot. In "Persona 4", this was changed to a climate based framework, where changes in the climate keyed to the story influenced adversary conduct. "Persona 5" presents components, for example, platforming and stealth ongoing interaction to cell investigation. The All-Out Attack can be started in a "Hold-Up" session, activated when all foes are thumped down. 

A characterizing part of the arrangement is the Personas, signs of an individual's mind. Numerous Personas utilized something like "Persona 3" are roused by Graeco-Roman folklore. In "Persona 4" they depend on Japanese gods; "Persona 5" utilizes characters propelled by prevalent anecdotal and verifiable fugitives. The bringing custom for Personas in fight differs all through the arrangement: in early amusements, the gathering picks up the capacity to bring through a short custom subsequent to playing a parlor diversion; in "Persona 3", they discharge a firearm like gadget called an Evoker at their head; in "Persona 4", they bring their Personas utilizing Tarot cards; in "Persona 5", they are brought through the characters' veils. 

Personas are utilized for sorts of physical assault and otherworldly assaults, alongside activities, for example, mending and relieving or exacting status impacts. For all "Persona" recreations, every single playable character begin with an underlying Persona, which can develop into different Personas through story-based occasions and use amid fight. In different "Persona" amusements, at least two Personas can be gathered without a moment's delay to play out an incredible Fusion Spell. In "Persona 3", "4" and "5", just the fundamental character can use and change between various Personas; different characters utilize a solitary Persona. Over the span of the amusement, the player obtains more Personas through an arrangement of Skill Cards, spoken to by Major Arcana Tarot cards. Every aptitude card speaks to an alternate Persona family, which thusly hold their own capacities inborn to that family. Numerous Personas can be melded to make another Persona with improved and acquired capacities: these range from intertwining two Personas in the "Persona 2" duology, to combining up to twelve in "Persona 4". Beginning with "Persona 3", the principle hero of each diversion has a capacity known as "Special case", a capacity to call different Personas spoken to by the Fool Arcana. 

"Social Links" is a framework presented in "Persona 3" that is a type of character association fixing to the development of Personas. Amid their time outside fight, the fundamental character can cooperate with and grow a specific Social Link, which goes about as an autonomous character development framework attached to a Persona family or Arcanum. As the fundamental character's association with the character speaking to a Social Link develops, its rank is raised and all the more dominant Personas identified with the Social Link's appointed Arcanum can be brought and melded. Credits identified with the principle character's public activity can likewise be utilized to improve their Persona capacities, for example, their scholastic capacities and social bent. An improved form of the Social Link framework, known as "Partners", showed up in "Persona 5". 

In "Persona", the "Persona 2" duology, and "Persona 5", there is likewise an "Exchange" repairman persisted from the "Megami Tensei" arrangement, in which player characters can converse with foes and incite certain activities relying upon their discourse decisions. A few reactions yield Skill Cards for use in making new Personas. Exchange was expelled from "Persona 3" and "Persona 4", in spite of the fact that Atlus staff thought about the Social Link framework and parts of Persona Fusion to be a "hidden" form of it. In "Persona 5", they can be started amid a "Hold Up" session; Shadows can be induced to join the gathering as another Persona if the Negotiation is fruitful, the player character has space in their program and is at a fitting knowledge level. 

The "Persona" arrangement happens in current Japan and spotlights on a gathering of secondary school understudies, with the special case to this being "Endless Punishment", which concentrated on a gathering of grown-ups. The setting has been depicted as urban dream, with exceptional occasions occurring in generally typical areas. The run of the mill setting utilized is a city, with a prominent exemption being the provincial town setting of "Persona 4". Despite the fact that they are ordinarily remain solitary recreations that just offer topical components, the "Persona" diversions share a congruity, with components from past amusements turning up in later ones. "Persona" and the "Persona 2" amusements shared story components which were finished up with "Everlasting Punishment", so "Persona 3" began with a crisp setting and characters. The first in the arrangement is "Persona", set in the year 1996. This is trailed by the occasions of "Guiltless Sin" and "Interminable Punishment" in 1999. Toward the finish of "Honest Sin", the primary characters change occasions to turn away the demolition of Earth, making the "Interminable Punishment" reality, with the first reality turning into a secluded Other Side. "Persona 3" and resulting amusements come from "Everlasting Punishment". "Persona 3" is set from 2009 to 2010, and "Persona 4" is set from 2011 to 2012. The "Persona 4 Arena" diversions and "Moving All Night" happen in the months following "Persona 4". "Persona Q" happens in a different encased world in which the characters of "Persona 3" and "4" are drawn into from their individual timespans. Conversely, "Persona 5" is set in a non-explicit year alluded to as "20XX". 

A focal idea for the arrangement is the aggregate oblivious, a spot created by the hearts of mankind and from which Personas are conceived. As indicated by the official "Persona Club P3" book, the aggregate oblivious was created by the crude life on Earth as a methods for containing the otherworldly embodiment of Nyx, a space-conceived being whose nearness would cause the demise of all life on Earth. Her body was harmed by the effect and turned into the moon, while her mind was left superficially and bolted away at the core of the aggregate oblivious. The pieces of Nyx's mind, known as "Shadows", are both a risk and a critical piece of mankind's presence. To additionally help shield against threatening Shadows, individuals produced the gods that exist inside the aggregate oblivious, a significant number of which show as Personas. Nyx shows up in "Persona 3" as the adversary. The significant prison areas in each diversion, for example, Tartarus in "Persona 3" and Palaces in "Persona 5", are created by the inactive wishes and wants of people, and are commonly utilized by another power for their very own closures. A repetitive area showing up in the vast majority of the amusements is the "Velvet Room", a spot among the real world and obviousness made by Philemon that changes structure contingent upon the mind of its present visitor. Its occupants, driven by a puzzling elderly person called Igor, help the primary characters by helping them sharpen their Persona capacities. While typically difficult to reach and undetectable to all aside from the individuals who fashioned an agreement with the room, others can be gathered nearby the visitor, purposefully or something else. 

The primary character of every "Persona" diversion is a quiet hero speaking to the player, with a way portrayed by the arrangement's executive as "quiet and cool". At the point when the essayist for new story content in "Everlasting Punishment"s PSP rendition wanted for the primary character to have spoken discourse, this was vetoed as it conflicted with the arrangement convention. Two repeating characters produced by the aggregate oblivious are Philemon and Nyarlathotep, the individual delegates of the positive and negative characteristics of mankind. In "Blameless Sin", the two uncover that they are occupied with an intermediary challenge regarding whether mankind can grasp its opposing sentiments and locate a higher reason before crushing itself. Philemon shows up in later "Persona" amusements as a blue butterfly. A significant number of the real enemies in the arrangement are embodiments of death created by the human subliminal. The focal subject of the "Persona" arrangement is investigation of the human mind and the fundamental characters finding their actual selves. The accounts by and large spotlight on the primary cast's relational connections and brain research projects. There is likewise a hidden spotlight on "the human spirit". 

A considerable lot of the ideas and characters inside the arrangement (Personas, Shadows, Philemon) utilize Jungian brain science and originals. A common theme are the "covers" individuals wear amid regular day to day existence, which binds back to their Personas. This theme was all the more plainly communicated in "Persona 5" through the fundamental throws' utilization of covers in their cheat appearances. The double existences of the fundamental throws are straightforwardly motivated by these topics. Each diversion additionally incorporates explicit topics and themes. "Persona 2" centers around the impact of gossipy tidbits on the texture of the real world (alluded to by the engineers as "the intensity of Kotodama"); "Persona 3" utilizes topics including wretchedness and the murkiness inside individuals; "Persona 4" centers around how tattle and the media impacts individuals' perspectives on others; and "Persona 5" indicates how the principle characters seek after individual flexibility in a prohibitive current society. A repetitive component in the prior sections is "The Butterfly Dream", a celebrated story by the Chinese logician Zhuang Zhou. It ties in with the arrangement's subjects, and furthermore with Philemon's continuous appearances as a butterfly. Philemon's unique appearance depended on Zhuang Zhou. The character Nyarlathotep depends on the character of a similar name from H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and the Mythos in general is every now and again referenced in "Persona 2". The Velvet Room depended on the Black Lodge from "Twin Peaks". Igor and different partners of the Velvet Room are altogether named after characters from the novel "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley. 

The "Persona" arrangement was first imagined after the arrival of "Shin Megami Tensei If..." for the Super Famicom. As the secondary school setting of "If..." had been emphatically gotten, Atlus chose to make a devoted subseries concentrating on the internal battles of youthful grown-ups. The attention on secondary school life was additionally chosen because of the encounters of the arrangement's makers, Kouji Okada and Kazuma Kaneko: as per them, as about everybody encounters being an understudy sooner or later in their lives, it was something everybody could identify with, speaking to a period of both learning and individual flexibility. In their view, this methodology helped players acknowledge the arrangement's topics and the assortment of thoughts incorporated into each title. Kaneko specifically endeavored to reproduce his encounters and the effect it had on him amid his time with the arrangement. The primary idea driving the principal amusement was a "Megami Tensei" title that was more agreeable for new and easygoing players than the principle arrangement. The wealth of easygoing diversions on the PlayStation strengthened this choice. The diversion's title, spoke to the amusement's status as an immediate turn off from the arrangement. It was later dropped to additionally characterize "Persona" as an independent arrangement. After the achievement of "Persona", "Blameless Sin" started advancement, holding a considerable lot of the first staff. Amid the composition of "Honest Sin", it was chosen that the universe of "Persona 2" required an alternate point of view than that of the present hero. This choice laid the foundation for "Everlasting Punishment". Following this, the "Persona" arrangement entered a break while center swung to different undertakings, including "". 

The theoretical "Persona 3" was submitted to Atlus in 2003 by Katsura Hashino, who had functioned as an originator for various "Megami Tensei" recreations and had been the executive for "Nocturne". Picking up Atlus' endorsement of the idea, advancement began around the same time, after the culmination of "Nocturne" and the "Computerized Devil Saga" duology. "Persona 3" was a piece of Atlus' push to grow their player base outside of Japan. Thoughts were being passed around about "Persona 4", however the diversion did not start official advancement until after the arrival of "Persona 3". Arrangements for "Persona 5"s advancement started in 2010. The group chose to move towards all the more testing story topics, saying that the move would be more radical than that accomplished with "Persona 3". "Persona 4 Arena" and its spin-off were the first non-RPG community venture in the arrangement: its prosperity roused the making of both "Persona Q" and "Moving All Night". 

The initial three "Persona" amusements were created by Atlus' inner R&D1 studio, the studio in charge of the mainline "Megami Tensei" recreations. Starting with "Persona 3", a devoted group initially alluded to as the second Creative Production Department started dealing with advancement for the arrangement. The group was later renamed P-Studio in 2012. Hashino stayed accountable for the studio until the Japanese arrival of "Persona 5" in 2016, when he moved to establish another division, Studio Zero, and work on another undertaking. Beside Atlus, different designers have created passages in the "Persona" arrangement. Amid the pre-generation phase of "Persona 4 Arena", Hashino moved toward Arc System Works subsequent to being awed by their work on the "BlazBlue" arrangement. For "Moving All Night", improvement was at first taken care of by Dingo, however were later dropped from the undertaking totally because of value worries, with Atlus assuming control over full advancement of the amusement. 

The two character specialists for the "Persona" arrangement are Kazuma Kaneko, a focal craftsman in the primary "Megami Tensei" arrangement who planned characters for the initial three "Persona" recreations, and Shigenori Soejima, who worked in an optional limit nearby Kaneko and had Kaneko's spot as the character architect from "Persona 3" onwards. While structuring the characters for "Persona", Kaneko was propelled by numerous striking big names and anecdotal characters of the time, alongside individuals from Atlus staff. In "Persona" and "Honest Sin", the principle characters all wore a similar school outfits, so Kaneko separated them utilizing frill. For "Endless Punishment", the primary cast were grown-ups, so Kaneko expected to reevaluate his plan method. In the end, he received the idea of normal grown-ups, and gave them plans that would emerge in-diversion. 

Soejima's first significant work for the arrangement was chipping away at side characters for "Persona 2" close by Kaneko. Kaneko place Soejima responsible for the arrangement's craft bearing after "Persona 2" as Kaneko did not have any desire to engrave his illustration style on the "Persona" arrangement, and furthermore needed Soejima to pick up involvement. Soejima felt a level of weight when he was given his new job, as the arrangement had collected a generous after amid Kaneko's residency. In a later meeting, Soejima said that despite the fact that he regarded and respected Kaneko, he never intentionally imitated the last's work, and in the long run subsided into the job of satisfying the devotees of the "Persona" arrangement, moving toward character plans with making something new instead of alluding back to Kaneko's work. For his character structures, Soejima utilizes genuine individuals he has met or seen, taking a gander at what their appearance says about their identity. On the off chance that his plans come excessively near the general population he has seen, he completes a harsh sketch while remembering the identity of the individual. For his work on "Persona Q", his first time working with a distorted Chibi style because of its connections with the "Etrian Odyssey" arrangement, Soejima considered what fans felt about the characters. A pivotal piece of his plan system was seeing what made a character emerge, at that point modifying those highlights so they stayed conspicuous even with the overhaul. 

Beginning with "Persona 3", every "Persona" amusement has been characterized by an alternate tasteful and key shading. It is one of the main aesthetic choices made by the group: "Persona 3" has a dim environment and genuine characters, so the essential shading was picked as blue to mirror these and the urban setting. Conversely, "Persona 4" has a lighter tone and characters yet in addition sports a homicide riddle plot, so the shading yellow was picked to speak to both the lighter tones and to bring out a "notice" flag. As indicated by Soejima, blue was the "shade of youthfulness", and yellow was the "shade of joy". For "Persona 5", the shading picked was red, to pass on a brutal inclination rather than the past "Persona" recreations and tie in with the amusement's story topics. Its craft style was portrayed as a characteristic advancement from where "Persona 4" left off. 

The music of the "Persona" arrangement has been taken care of by various writers. The one most connected with the arrangement is Shoji Meguro, who started taking a shot at "Persona" not long after he joined Atlus in 1995. His absolute first arrangement for the diversion was "Aria of the Soul", the topic for the velvet room that turned into a common track all through the arrangement. Amid his underlying work on the arrangement, Meguro felt confined by the constrained extra room of the PlayStation's circle framework, thus when he started forming for "Persona 3", which took into consideration sound gushing because of expanded equipment limit, he had the capacity to completely express his melodic style. His fundamental stress for his music in "Persona 3" and "4" was the artists' articulation of the English verses. He was unfit to take a shot at the "Persona 2" diversions as he was tied up with different ventures, including "Maken X". Meguro additionally filled in as the lead arranger in "Persona 5", utilizing components of corrosive jazz and the amusement's subjects for motivation to accomplish the correct disposition. The music for "Honest Sin" and "Everlasting Punishment" was taken care of by Toshiko Tasaki, Kenichi Tsuchiya, and Masaki Kurokawa. Tsuchiya had initially done minor work on "Persona", and discovered creating for the amusements a strenuous encounter. Turn offs, for example, the "Persona Q" and "Moving" subseries, are generally dealt with by different Atlus authors, for example, Atsushi Kitajoh, Toshiki Konishi, and Ryota Kozuka. 

The arrangement comprises of thirteen recreations, not including re-discharges and versatile amusements. "Persona" was the principal pretending passage in the "Megami Tensei" establishment to be discharged outside of Japan, as past sections had been viewed as ineligible because of conceivably dubious substance. As instances of this substance were in a milder structure for "Persona", the confinements did not have any significant bearing. As per Atlus, "Persona" and its spin-off were to test player responses to the "Megami Tensei" arrangement outside of Japan. The more noteworthy lion's share of "Persona" amusements were either first discharged on or selective to PlayStation stages. This pattern was broken with the arrival of "Persona Q" for the 3DS in 2014. All the "Persona" diversions have been distributed by Atlus in Japan and North America. An exemption in Japan was the Windows port of "Persona", which was distributed by ASCII Corporation. After 2016, due to Atlus USA's merger with Sega of America, Sega took over North American distributing obligations, in spite of the fact that the Atlus brand stayed flawless. 

Because of the organization not having an European branch, Atlus has commonly given distributing obligations to other outsider distributers with branches in Europe. This every now and again results in a hole between North American and European discharge dates going from a couple of months to a year or more. For "Persona 3", Atlus gave distributing obligations to Koei. For "Persona 4", European distributing was taken care of by Square Enix. "Persona 4 Arena" was initially distributed in Europe by Zen United after a long postponement, however the computerized rights were in the end come back to Atlus, bringing about the amusement being expelled from PSN. Atlus wound up re-distributing the computerized PlayStation form in Europe. They had already carefully distributed the PSP port of "Persona" in Europe and Australia. "Field Ultimax" was distributed in Europe by Sega, who had as of late obtained Atlus' parent organization. It was conjectured this could prompt another pattern that would abbreviate the discharge hole between North America and Europe. A customary distributing accomplice was Ghostlight, whose relations with Atlus returned to the European arrival of "Nocturne". A later accomplice was NIS America, which distributed "Persona 4 Golden", "Persona Q", and "Moving All Night". Atlus' association with NIS America finished in 2016, with NIS America refering to troubles with the organization since its obtaining by Sega as purposes behind the split. As a major aspect of their announcement, NIS America said that Atlus had moved toward becoming "fastidious" about European accomplices, choosing those which could offer the most astounding negligible deals ensure on their items. Sega of America and Atlus USA in the end went into an organization with European distributing organization Deep Silver to distribute various amusements in the area, including "Persona 5". 

The confinements for the "Persona" arrangement are commonly dealt with by interpreter Yu Namba of Atlus USA, who likewise handles limitation for numerous other "Megami Tensei" amusements. Another noticeable staff part was Nich Maragos, who worked with Namba on numerous "Persona" diversions until moving to Nintendo of America preceding 2015. The limitation of "Persona" was dealt with by a little group, which put a ton of weight on them as they expected to modify the amusement for Western gatherings of people: the progressions actualized included adjusting names, changing the presence of characters, and evacuating various social references. A whole interchange primary mission was additionally evacuated. After "Persona", it was chosen that future "Persona" diversions should be as steadfast as conceivable to their unique discharges. Namba's first confinement venture for the arrangement was "Endless Punishment". For the arrival of "Blameless Sin", there was a discussion about whether to discharge it, as it contained conceivably dubious substance including references to Nazism. At last, because of staff and asset deficiencies, "Guiltless Sin" was ignored for limitation for its spin-off "Interminable Punishment". Afterward, when the organization built up the PSP ports, the group discharged the ports of "Persona" and "Honest Sin" abroad so fans pulled in by "Persona 3" and "4" would most likely effectively make up for lost time with the remainder of the arrangement. The confinement for "Persona" was totally revamped, returning all the past modified substance and reestablishing all recently cut substance. The port of "Interminable Punishment" was not restricted because of "unordinary conditions", so the organization discharged the first form on PSN. 

For the restrictions of "Persona 3" and "4", the group joined however much of the first substance as could be expected, for example, utilizing Japanese honorifics and keeping the diversion's money as yen as opposed to evolving it. When in doubt, they join social components from the first forms except if they would not be comprehended by the player, for example, with specific jokes. All things considered, a few changes must be made. In one example, the character Mitsuru Kirijo was initially an English speaker, yet her second language for the restricted rendition was changed to French because of her refined appearance. School tests additionally should have been changed because of comparative language-based issues. The Social Links were initially called yet this was changed as "Network" had a quite certain importance in English. The new name was enlivened by the way the character Igor made reference to the idea utilizing words, for example, "society" and "bonds". Some in-amusement Easter egg references were likewise changed: in "Persona 3" references to "Shin Megami Tensei" by a character in an in-diversion MMORPG were changed to reference before "Persona" recreations, while notices of an anecdotal investigator in "Persona 4" were modified to reference the Kuzunoha family from "Unceasing Punishment" and the "Fallen angel Summoner" arrangement. Character names have likewise required alteration, for example, the stage name of "Persona 4" character Rise Kujikawa, and the manner in which characters alluded to one another was changed in accordance with advance more to a western gathering of people. "Persona 5" was likewise confined in this design. 

The confined English names of diversions have additionally been adjusted. The standard title for "Persona" was changed from "Megami Ibunroku" to "Disclosures", mainly in light of the fact that the group thought the last name sounded "cool". The "Disclosures" title was evacuated for "Guiltless Sin" and "Endless Punishment". After the effective arrival of "Nocturne", the ""Shin Megami Tensei"" moniker was added to the arrangement title to help with Western promoting. This has not been the situation for certain recreations: "Persona 4 Arena" unique title, "Persona 4: The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena", was abbreviated as it sounded "ungainly", and the ""Shin Megami Tensei"" moniker was dropped as it would have made the title excessively long, which has been connected to each amusement in the arrangement since. A similar change was made for "Persona 4 Golden", with the group additionally dropping ""The"" that was in the Japanese title since it would have sounded "odd" in English-talking districts. 

By October 2018, the arrangement had sold about 9.3 million duplicates around the world. The principal "Persona" was alluded to at the time as a sleeper hit, and its accomplishment and "Unceasing Punishment" set up both Atlus and "Megami Tensei" in North America. In Europe, the arrangement did not progress toward becoming set up preceding the arrival of "Persona 3" and "4", the two of which were very effective in the locale. As indicated by Atlus CEO Naoto Hiraoka, the fundamental defining moment for the establishment was the arrival of "Persona 3", which was a business achievement and conveyed the arrangement to the consideration of the standard gaming network. "Persona 4" got a stunningly better gathering. The "Persona" arrangement's prosperity has permitted Atlus to assemble a solid player base outside of Japan, adding to the achievement of different recreations, for example, "Catherine". 

The "Persona" arrangement has been alluded to as the most well known turn off from the "Megami Tensei" establishment, picking up reputation and accomplishment in its very own right. Io9's James Whitbrook remarked that while "here in the west, we have a lot of magnificent urban dream, particularly from a YA point of view. Yet, makes Persona intriguing that it's the well-known idea of Urban dream, the equalization of the ordinary "typical" existence of the heroes and the issues they have there with the fantastical idea of the extraordinary world that lies underneath all that, from a Japanese viewpoint. Here, that is substantially less normal, and the manner in which the arrangement depicts urban dream through that viewpoint is the thing that makes it so extraordinary, particularly from what you would ordinarily anticipate from Japanese RPGs.". "Nintendo Power", in an article concerning the "Megami Tensei" arrangement, refered to the "Persona" arrangement's "cutting edge frightfulness stories" and "groups of Japanese secondary school kids" as the ideal case of the establishment. "Persona" was referenced in 1999 by GameSpot's Andrew Vestal as a diversion that merited consideration regardless of not maturing admirably, saying "Analyzing "Persona" uncovers three of the qualities that make the arrangement so mainstream - and exceptional - among RPG fans: demonology, exchange, and brain research". The diversion has been named as a clique great. "Persona 3" was named by RPGamer as the best RPG of the previous decade in 2009, and RPGFan recorded "Persona 3" and "4" in second and fourth spot individually in their comparable 2011 rundown. "Persona 3" was recorded by Gamasutra as one of the 20 fundamental RPGs for players of the class. "Persona 4" was additionally recorded by "Famitsu" as one of the best rounds ever in a 2010 rundown. 

Just as increasing basic approval, the arrangement has been the subject of discussion over its substance. This debate started with the confined pennant title of the first "Persona", which raised worries because of its religious ramifications. Kurt Katala, composing for 1UP.com in 2006 about the questionable substance of the "Megami Tensei" establishment overall, referenced "Guiltless Sin"s references to homosexuality, schoolyard savagery, and Nazism, thinking of them as conceivable reasons why the diversion was not initially discharged outside of Japan. In 1UP.com's 2007 diversion grants, which kept running in the March 2008 issue of "Electronic Gaming Monthly", "Persona 3" was given the "Most questionable amusement that made no debate" grant: the authors said "Rockstar's Hot Coffee sex outrage and "Bully"s kid on-kid kissing has nothing on this PS2 job player's suicide-started fights or subplot including understudy instructor dating".
