Wark was conceived on 4 August 1957, in Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital to guardians Alex and Helen. The third of four kids, he has a more seasoned sister Wilma, more seasoned sibling Alex and more youthful sibling Andrew. The family lived in a four-story apartment obstruct in Partick. The family was ruined: Wark's folks couldn't bear the cost of a bunk and as a little tyke, he dozed in a cabinet from a sideboard. In spite of the fact that dedicated John, Wark was before long alluded to by his family as Johnny, a humble that stuck all through his footballing profession. 

In the mid 1960s, the family moved to another apartment obstruct, this time in Scotstoun, and Wark's dad verified work at adjacent Albion Motors. The new home suited a back yard in which Wark played football from the age of six. He said "[f]ootball appeared to possess 99 percent of my time as a youth" as he endeavored to copy his sibling Alex, who had turned into an expert at St Mirren. Wark went to Scotstoun Primary School, where he moved toward becoming chief of the football crew. On moving to auxiliary school, he was chosen for the Glasgow Schools agent group. He additionally played for Drumchapel Amateurs at the under-14 level, where he was, for a period, overseen by David Moyes' dad, likewise named David. 

Amid Wark's time at Drumchapel, he pulled in the consideration of Celtic. He prepared with the club at their Parkhead ground, before getting an encouragement to sign student frames for the club. As a deep rooted Rangers fan with whom Celtic have a remarkable contention and with enthusiasm from "a few English clubs", including Bristol City, Manchester City and Ipswich Town, Wark slowed down on the offer. He trialed with both Ipswich Town and Manchester City, and chose Ipswich when the last remained wary. On landing in Portman Road, Town supervisor Bobby Robson, later portrayed by Wark as the individual in football "who had the single greatest effect on [him]", by and by invited him and Wark marked with the club as a student. 

Wark began his profession at Ipswich in the young group, at first playing at left back before moving to the focal point of barrier and sometimes involving the privilege back position. He joined as an expert for the club on his seventeenth birthday celebration. Chosen for the senior squad as a substitution for the harmed Kevin Beattie, Wark made his first-group debut on 27 March 1975 in the 3â 2 FA Cup sixth round (third replay) triumph over Leeds United; the amusement was played at Leicester City's Filbert Street. An apprehensive and nostalgic Wark was consoled by director Robson: 

"My presentation was in the quarter-last of the FA Cup against the Leeds group of Giles and Bremner. He [Robson] stated, 'I wouldn't place you in the group in the event that I didn't think you were sufficient'. He was a dad figure also on the grounds that I was yearning to go home. On the off chance that it hadn't been for the supervisor I would have been straight back to Glasgow." 

Showing up instead of harmed regulars, Wark finished the season still on the young group, and experienced achievement in the last of the FA Youth Cup, crushing West Ham United 5â 1. He spent a significant part of the 1975â 76 season playing for the stores, and was given the club's Young Player of the Year grant, in spite of showing up for the senior group.

In the June 1977, Wark was chosen for the Scotland squad out of the blue, for a well disposed match against East Germany; in any case, a torn hamstring supported in pre-season preparing finished any opportunity of a universal presentation. The damage likewise kept him out of first-group football until January 1978, when he returned for a match against Cardiff City in the third round of the 1977â 78 FA Cup. 

Apathetic association exhibitions that season implied that Ipswich completed only three over the transfer zone, however the season finished in achievement in the FA Cup. Wark scored in a 3â 1 triumph over West Bromwich Albion in the semi-last, and showed up in the last at Wembley as a feature of a side that astonished top choices Arsenal, winning 1â 0. Wark commented, "We were dark horses however on the day we pounded them." Wark did not contact the ball for the initial 18 minutes of the match, and as the players left the pitch at half-time, David Geddis said to Wark, "Ensure you hit it between the posts in the second-half. Keep away from the white bits." In the second 50% of the amusement, Wark "disregarded Geddis' recommendation and hit Pat Jennings' correct post twice with practically indistinguishable swerving right-foot shots from outside the punishment region". 

Twice in the three seasons that pursued, Ipswich came extremely close to winning the League title, yet completed as sprinters up to Liverpool and Aston Villa, individually. Be that as it may, Ipswich won the club's solitary European trophy when they lifted the 1980â 81 UEFA Cup. Wark set a challenge record by scoring 14 objectivesâincluding two, one in every legâin the last as Ipswich defeated Dutch side AZ 67 Alkmaar 5â 4 on total. Wark's record equalled the long-standing scoring record in an European challenge, set by JosÃ© Altafini of A.C. Milan in the 1962â 63 European Cup.

Following a rejected interest for a pay increment, Wark presented an exchange demand, which was acknowledged. He marked for Liverpool for Â£450,000 on 10 March 1984. At the time, Liverpool had won the group title multiple times, the European Cup multiple times and the League Cup multiple times in the first eight seasons. 

Wark's last full season at Portman Road, 1982â 83, had seen him record the most astounding group objectives count of his vocation. He scored 20 objectives in 42 class amusements, however it was insufficient to keep Ipswich from slipping to ninth spot in the last table â their most reduced position since completing eighteenth in 1978. 

The therapeutic examination for Wark's exchange to some degree shocked him: 

"I was fairly shocked when the specialist went into the Anfield boot room", Wark said. "He was little in stature and I really wanted to distinguish the smell of liquor on his breath as he acquainted himself with me. I was considerably increasingly shocked when he reported we would remain put to direct the therapeutic examination. "He took my circulatory strain, took a gander at the perusing and murmured 'that is fine'. At that point something happened that right up 'til the present time regardless I can't get over. He requested that I twist down and contact my toes. "Doing whatever it takes not to demonstrate my shock, I did precisely as he asked and as I lifted my head he talked once more, this opportunity to report 'you've passed'. That was it, my Liverpool medicinal." 

Wark made his presentation for the club on 31 March 1984 out of a 2â 0 association win against Watford at Vicarage Road, and scored Liverpool's opening objective in the 58th moment. Liverpool won the English association title that season, and Wark showed up to gain himself an award.

He in the end recovered his wellness yet attempted to recapture his place in the Liverpool group until damage to Steve McMahon permitted him back in. Wark went ahead as a late substitute (however as indicated by him, never contacted the ball) when Liverpool lost the 1987 League Cup Final to Arsenal. No longer a piece of supervisor Kenny Dalglish's arrangements following the entry of new midfielders including John Barnes, Wark was sold back to Ipswich on 4 January 1988 for Â£100,000. Disregarding more monetarily rewarding ideas from both Watford and Coventry City, he pursued Bobby Robson's recommendation: "Cash isn't all that mattersâgo where you will be most joyful." Wark left the Merseyside club with a record of 42 objectives in 108 appearances, an objective each 2.6 amusements. 

Ipswich had been consigned year and a half before Wark's arrival to the club were all the while playing in the second level of English football. Amid this second spell at Ipswich, Wark was near being an ever-present in the side: he missed only two diversions in two seasons.

Wark was offended; Middlesbrough lost the second leg 1â 0. Todd left from the club and was supplanted by Lennie Lawrence, who demanded that all players live "inside an hour of Ayresome Park". Wark was all the while living in Ipswich at the time and following a "reasonable understanding" with Lawrence, Wark's agreement was ended and he turned into a free specialist once more.
