Lockheed C-130 Hercules in Australian administration 

The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) has worked forty-eight Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport airplane. The sort entered Australian administration in December 1958, when No.Â 36 Squadron acknowledged the first of twelve C-130As, supplanting its revered Douglas C-47 Dakotas. The procurement made Australia the principal administrator of the Hercules after the United States. In 1966 the C-130As were joined by twelve C-130Es, which prepared No.Â 37 Squadron. The C-130As were supplanted by twelve C-130Hs in 1978, and the C-130Es by twelve C-130J Super Hercules in 1999. No.Â 37 Squadron turned into the RAAF's sole Hercules administrator in 2006, when No.Â 36 Squadron exchanged its C-130Hs before changing over to Boeing C-17 GlobemasterÂ III substantial transports. The C-130Hs were resigned in November 2012, leaving the C-130J as the main model in Australian administration. 

The RAAF's first vital airlifter, the Hercules has habitually been utilized to convey fiasco help in Australia and the Pacific locale, just as to help military organizations abroad. The flying machine saw broad administration amid the Vietnam War, transporting troops and load to Southeast Asia and undertaking aeromedical clearing. Nineteen of the RAAF's armada of twenty-four C-130s partook in aid projects in 1974â 75 after Cyclone Tracy struck Darwin. From that point forward, the Hercules have been associated with philanthropic missions to New Guinea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Cambodia, Bali, Sumatra, and New Zealand. They have likewise observed administration amid the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Fijian upsets in 1987, tasks in Somalia in 1993, INTERFET activities in East Timor in 1999â 2000, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq starting in 2001. In more than fifty years of Australian administration, the Hercules have gathered in excess of 800,000 flying hours. 

Toward the finish of World War II, the RAAF's prime transport air ship was the twin-engined Douglas C-47 Dakota. In 1946, C-47 tasks were thought under No.Â 86 Wing and its three flying squadrons, Nos.Â 36, 37, and 38, based at first at RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales. In spite of the strength and adaptability of the Dakota, by the mid 1950s the Air Force was searching for a supplanting with more prominent payload limit and longer range, to more readily encourage the organization and supply of Australian powers. In 1954, the RAAF left on a noteworthy re-gear drive, following a move in barrier financing that supported the Air Force. The Air Officer Commanding Home Command, Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch, drove a mission abroad to analyze potential new warrior, plane, transport and preparing flying machine. 

Four British transports were considered: the Blackburn Beverley, Bristol 179B, Bristol 195 and Short PD 16/1. The mission additionally surveyed the American Fairchild C-119G Flying Boxcar, Fairchild C-123 Provider and Lockheed C-130A Hercules. Of these sorts, the mission evaluated that the Beverley, C-123 and C-130 could possibly meet the RAAF's necessities. Following further thought of the alternatives after their arrival to Australia, in mid 1955 the individuals from the mission consistently prescribed that Hercules be secured, as the other two sorts did not meet probably the most vital components of the prerequisite. Right now the Australian Government was hesitant to finance any new gear for the RAAF, and a choice to get twelve C-130s was not made until mid-1957. An agreement for these air ship was marked in October that year. The Australian C-130As were to be like those in administration with the United States Air Force (USAF), the primary contrast being the utilization of TF56-A-11 motors in the spot of the standard TF56-A-1 and TF56-A-9s; these motors gave nearly a similar power, however were changed to meet Australian fuel prerequisites. The all out expense for the air ship, starting group preparing and bolster hardware was $US36 million (comparable to around 16 million Australian pounds). 

The Hercules spoke to a tremendous improvement over the C-47 in payload, range, speed and mobility, just as offering lodge pressurization, short-departure and-landing capacity, and mass stacking and despatch by means of its back freight entryway. The Government communicated worry over the cost, at one phase proposing the buy of just three flying machine, yet in the long run the Air Force won endorsement for the twelve that it needed. Depicted by the official history of the post-war RAAF as second just to the General Dynamics F-111C as the "most huge" obtaining by the Air Force, the Hercules gave the Australian military its first key airdrop capacity, which in years to come would give a "life saver" for organizations to Malaya, Vietnam, and different pieces of Southeast Asia. Australia was the main nation other than the United States to work the Hercules. The RAAF's C-130As were likewise the remainder of this variation to be fabricated. 

RAAF teams started preparing on the Hercules amidst 1958 at Sewart Air Force Base in Nashville, Tennessee. A significant part of the preparation occurred on a test system, increased by roughly fifty hours flying time in the air ship. To adapt to the Hercules' complexities, the aircrew class of flight engineer, missing from the RAAF since World WarÂ II, was restored. Another classification, that of loadmaster, was likewise organized; pilots performing comparative obligations on Dakotas had done as such on a specially appointed as opposed to a lasting premise, without a particular class having been formalized. An expert team part was expected to make weight-and-equalization figurings and manage stacking and despatch for the Hercules' 20-ton cargo limit (contrasted with three-and-a-half tons in a Dakota) and for its different payload conveyance frameworks. A huge overhang recently used to support seaplanes at RAAF Base Rathmines was dismantled and re-raised at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, where the C-130s would be based. 

A choice to buy another twelve C-130s was reported in November 1964. Right now the C-130As were being utilized to supply the Australian powers occupied with the Vietnam War. This undertaking showed that the RAAF had deficient since quite a while ago run transport flying machine to all the while bolster abroad organizations and meet the power's local prerequisites in Australia. Therefore, the Government chose to arrange twelve C-130E Hercules as a component of a bundle of acquisitions for the RAAF and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) that additionally included ten Lockheed P-3 Orion and fourteen Grumman S-2 Tracker sea watch flying machine, just as twelve Hawker Siddeley HS 748 transports. The 14.7-million-pound contract for the new C-130s was marked on 9 February 1965. As opposed to the worries raised by the legislature over the expense of obtaining the C-130As, this extension of the Hercules drive increased prepared understanding, due in no little part to the advantages for the furnished administrations, especially the Australian Army, shown by the initial twelve airplane. The long-serving C-130As were supplanted by new Hercules in the late 1970s; twelve C-130Hs were requested in June 1976 for an expense of $A86 million, and conveyances occurred among July and October 1978. 

The RAAF's initial model Hercules got a few fixes and alterations amid their administration lives. Amid the mid 1960s the majority of the C-130As were traveled to the United States to get new wing fuel tanks after the first tanks were influenced by consumption brought about by tropical organisms and microorganisms. Soon thereafter these flying machine got new boards on the upper surface of their wings after the first ones were observed to be broken. The C-130Es were likewise fitted with reinforced wing focus encloses the mid 1970s after proportionate USAF airplane were observed to experience the ill effects of more noteworthy than-anticipated wing worry amid tasks in Vietnam. Amid 1964 the C-130As got new doppler route frameworks, and the C-130Es and Hs were fitted with ring laser gyrator inertial route frameworks from 1989. In 1994, four of No.Â 36 Squadron's C-130Hs were furnished with Electronic Warfare Self Protection packs, including radar and rocket cautioning frameworks, and counter estimates, for example, waste and flares. Later in the decade, one of the C-130Hs was fitted with broad signs knowledge gear under the characterized "Task Peacemate"; this air ship was maintained by RAAF and Defense Signals Directorate work force and its reality was never freely affirmed by the Government. The altered C-130H was accounted for to even now be dynamic in the signs knowledge job in 2008. The C-130Hs were likewise among the main Australian military air ship to be adjusted to enable aircrew to work them while wearing night vision goggles. 

The Australian Government requested twelve C-130J Super Hercules in December 1995 and conveyances started amid 1999. As a feature of the arrangement consulted with Lockheed Martin, seven of the RAAF's C-130Es were exchanged to the organization as a byproduct of a marked down cost on the new air ship. At the time the request for the twelve C-130Js was put, the Government additionally took out choices for a further twenty-seven Super Hercules, however these were not taken up; the alternatives included seven airborne early cautioning and control and eight aeronautical refueling variations, just as up to eight transports for the Royal New Zealand Air Force. The RAAF was the main administrator of this C-130 variation, which was bigger than before models and had a team of just three (two pilots and a loadmaster) wiping out the guide and flight engineer jobs utilized in before models. The flying machine at first experienced genuine mechanical and programming issues just as a lack of extra parts, and were surveyed as "encountering noteworthy operational deficits" in a 2002 Australian National Audit Office report. The Defense Science and Technology Organization attempted extensive investigation into the C-130J plan and created enhancements to the flying machine that tended to issues with over the top vibration. The 2009 Defense white paper "" required the procurement of two more C-130Js to in part supplant the H variations. This buy did not proceed, as the administration rather requested a fifth Boeing C-17 GlobemasterÂ III. 

The C-130Js have been refreshed since entering administration. The majority of the air ship were fitted with radar cautioning collectors before the finish of 2012, and it is intended to outfit the Hercules with Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures frameworks by 2016. Starting at 2015, the Hercules' correspondences capacities were additionally to be refreshed by fitting the flying machine with satellite interchanges hardware and the gear important to enable them to utilize the Link 16 information trade organize. As of now the C-130s were likewise to be fitted with new rapid airdrop slopes at the back of their lodge, and will be cleared to drop bigger burdens. The C-130J's working programming has likewise been redesigned after some time, prompting improved execution. The RAAF is partaking in the advancement of further programming upgrades. Amid 2016 the majority of the C-130Js were fitted with cutting edge satellite correspondences frameworks that permitted the flying machine, and set out troops, to be retasked while in flight. As a component of this adjustment the air ship were fitted with an extra group station, and they convey a fourth team part when important to deal with complex correspondences undertakings. In 2019 the RAAF was accounted for to consider fitting Litening focusing on units to Hercules to improve group situational mindfulness and enable air ship to gather symbolism as a component of transport flights. 

In March 2015 "Australian Aviation" announced that, as a major aspect of the way toward building up another Defense White Paper, the Australian Government was thinking about buying two LC-130J Hercules fitted with landing skis and other hardware expected to enable the air ship to work in Antarctica. Whenever gained, these flying machine would be utilized to help the Australian Antarctic Division's activities following the conclusion of the Wilkins Runway close Casey Station. 

The RAAF's twelve C-130As were grabbed by their recently prepared Australian pilots from the Lockheed plant at Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia, and carried to Australia in three gatherings between December 1958 and March 1959. No.Â 36 Squadron, situated at RAAF Base Richmond, turned into the principal unit to work the new flying machine. Very quickly they set up customary dispatch benefits inside Australia and to RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaya. These flights principally included transporting freight, as Chief of the Air Staff Frederick Scherger coordinated in 1959 that the RAAF would keep on depending on sanctioned common carriers to move military faculty in light of the fact that these air ship were more qualified to the errand and in wartime all the C-130s would be expected to supply troops close to the forefronts. In February 1960 a Hercules flew the RAAF's first AIM-9 Sidewinder rockets from the United States to Butterworth to prepare the CAC Saber warriors based there. Group preparing was thorough, and from mid-1960 included the utilization of a test system. Just prepared transport pilots flew the Hercules in its initial long periods of administration, by and large having attempted a voyage through obligation with No.Â 38 Squadron's Dakotas. The official history of the post-war Air Force portrayed the Hercules as "likely the greatest advance up in air ship abilities" the RAAF had ever gotten, thinking of it as about multiple times as compelling as the Dakota, considering the upgrades in payload, range, and speed. Whenever No.Â 78 (Fighter) Wing and its two squadrons of CAC Sabers sent to Butterworth between October 1958 and February 1959, seven Dakotas were required to ship the staff and gear of No.Â 3 Squadron from Australia to Malaya, contrasted with two Hercules for No.Â 77 Squadron. The Hercules were the primary turboprop airplane worked by the RAAF. They were adjusted by No.Â 486 Maintenance Squadron, with more profound upkeep and updates completed by No.Â 2 Aircraft Depot (No.Â 2 AD), the two units being based at Richmond. The accessibility of extra parts from the US caused issues at an opportune time, establishing one C-130A for right around a year. 

No.Â 36 Squadron started parachute preliminaries with the Hercules in September 1960. Starting in May 1962, RAAF powers based at Ubon, Thailand, under SEATO courses of action were provided by a normal Hercules administration. In December that year, the Hercules made their first troop-conveying flights into a battle zone, when one of No.Â 36 Squadron's C-130s joined a Commonwealth airdrop from Singapore to Borneo at the initiation of the "Konfrontasi" among Indonesia and Malaysia; comparative missions would be attempted for a further five years. In 1964, the initial two Dassault MirageÂ III warriors to be collected in Australia were flown in pieces from France to the Government Aircraft Factories at Avalon, Victoria, by RAAF Hercules. That year, following the section into Australian administration of the de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou with No.Â 38 Squadron, No.Â 486 Squadron was disbanded and its hardware and staff partitioned somewhere in the range of Nos.Â 36 and 38 Squadrons. The RAAF's power of twelve C-130A Hercules was expanded by twelve C-130Es starting in August 1966. No.Â 37 Squadron, disbanded in 1948, was re-framed at Richmond to work the new models. No.Â 486 Squadron was likewise re-framed to give support to both Hercules squadrons. No.Â 36 Squadron's entrusting was principally residential and strategic in nature, while No.Â 37 Squadron's was abroad and key, attributable to the more drawn out scope of its C-130Es. In May 1967, three Hercules of No.Â 37 Squadron bolstered Operation Fast Caravan, the arrangement of 23 Mirages of No.Â 75 Squadron to Butterworth. 

Amid the late 1960s, forty-two percent of Hercules flying hours were dedicated to Australian Army activities. The C-130s attempted long-go missions to help Australian powers battling in the Vietnam War from 1965 until 1972. Following the organization of the first Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment to South Vietnam in mid 1965, the RAAF started fortnightly C-130 flights into the nation from June that year. These flights were at first led by C-130As, and conveyed high-need payload and travelers from Richmond to Vung Tau in South Vietnam by means of either Butterworth or Singapore. The size of the supply flights into South Vietnam extended in 1967 when No.Â 2 Squadron RAAF, which was furnished with English Electric Canberra aircraft, was sent to Phan Rang. A huge carrier codenamed Winter Grip was likewise directed in mid-1967 to supplant two Australian Army forces, which had finished their year-long voyage through obligation, with a couple of crisp brigades. The Hercules were called upon to help the withdrawal of the first Australian Task Force (1Â ATF) from South Vietnam, and Nos.Â 36 and 37 Squadrons attempted numerous forays to fly hardware and staff out of the nation amid 1971. In late 1972, C-130s were utilized to pull back the final Australian power in South Vietnam, the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam; the last components of this power left on board two Hercules on 20Â December 1972. 

Just as transport tasks, the Hercules flew numerous departure flights out of Vietnam to exchange injured or wiped out staff to Australia, by means of Butterworth, for further treatment. These flights were at first led as a major aspect of the customary dispatch administration, and the patients and RAAF medical caretakers needed to persevere through awkward conditions as the air ship had just simple offices for faculty on stretchers. Separate clearing flights started on 1Â July 1966, and proceeded at fortnightly interims until 1972; additional flights were made amid periods in which 1Â ATF endured substantial losses. In spite of the fact that the activity was commonly effective, just C-130Es were alloted to this errand from May 1967 after an article censuring the utilization of loud C-130As to transport injured faculty was distributed in "The Medical Journal of Australia". The C-130Es gave significantly more agreeable conditions and were fit for flying legitimately between South Vietnam and Australia when required. A sum of 3,164Â patients had been transported to Australia when the C-130 clearing flights finished in mid 1972. The Hercules likewise restored the groups of servicemen slaughtered in Vietnam to Australia. 

A large number of the RAAF's C-130s were redeployed to South Vietnam without further ado before the finish of the war in 1975. The fast North Vietnamese development amid the Spring Offensive uprooted a huge number of South Vietnamese regular folks, and the Australian Government sent a unit of Hercules to Saigon in March 1975 as a major aspect of a global guide exertion facilitated by the United States. This power, which was assigned DetachmentÂ S, had a normal quality of seven C-130s and around one hundred air and ground team, and was at first used to transport non military personnel displaced people from the bleeding edges. After South Vietnamese troopers were accounted for to have been transported close by regular citizens, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam coordinated that the Hercules were to just convey philanthropic payload. As the North Vietnamese progressed on Saigon, DetachmentÂ S was moved to Bangkok in Thailand, however kept on flying into South Vietnam every day. In general, DetachmentÂ S had conveyed 900Â tonnes of provisions before the finish of the war. On 4Â and 17Â April, flying machine of the separation flew 271Â orphaned youngsters to Bangkok as a component of the US-drove Operation Babylift. In late April, two of No.Â 37 Squadron's C-130Es were doled out to the United Nations to transport supplies all through Southeast Asia; this power was assigned DetachmentÂ N. The C-130Es started activities on 3Â May, and were essentially used to fly supplies into Laos. The air ship transported load between Thailand, Butterworth, Hong Kong and Singapore; when this mission finished toward the beginning of June, the two Hercules had directed 91Â sorties for the UN. Flying machine of DetachmentÂ S cleared Australian international safe haven faculty from Phnom Penh in Cambodia, just as Saigon, in a matter of seconds before they tumbled to Khmer Rouge and North Vietnamese powers in April 1975, after which the power came back to Australia. DetachmentÂ N additionally emptied the Australian government office in Vientiane, Laos, amid early June 1975. 

In the years after the finish of the Vietnam War, the Hercules kept on participating in military activities and bolster abroad peacekeeping responsibilities. They likewise turned out to be outstanding in the Southern Pacific subsequent to being approached for help following cataclysmic events, incorporating tidal wave in New Guinea, typhoons in the Solomon Islands and Tonga, and flames and floods in Australia. The Hercules had a huge impact in the departure of regular citizens following Cyclone Tracy in 1974â 75; a No.Â 37 Squadron C-130E was the primary air ship to contact down in Darwin following the fiasco. Eight of No.Â 36 Squadron's airplane were engaged with the aid project, flying over 550Â hours, and conveying 2,864Â passengers and practically 800,000Â lbs of payload, while No.Â 37 Squadron contributed 11Â aircraft, flying 700Â hours, and conveying 4,400 travelers and 1,300,000Â lbs of freight. On 19Â January 1978 a C-130E coming back to Australia from Butterworth was utilized to capture a medication sneaking airplane close Darwin; the bootlegger in the long run arrived at Katherine, and was captured. In the wake of timing up without 147,000Â accident flying hours throughout 20Â years, No.Â 36 Squadron's C-130As were supplanted in 1978 by C-130H models. The C-130Hs were principally utilized as strategic air lifters all through their administration with the RAAF, and worked intimately with the Army's uncommon powers units. 

The transfer of the C-130As took very nearly 10 years, with the procedure being liable to a police examination. Endeavors to sell the Hercules by delicate amid 1978 and 1979 were ineffective, and the American law office Ford and Vlahos was designated the business specialist for the air ship in 1981. One was sold to the French Government in 1983 and in this way exchanged to the Chadian Air Force. Another two Hercules were sold to the Colombian contract organization Aviaco in 1983, however the US State Department vetoed the arrangement in a matter of seconds before it was to have been finished over doubts that the flying machine would be utilized to sneak medications into the United States. A C-130A was exchanged to the recently settled organization International Air Aid and rented to the International Red Cross to fly compassionate supplies into Ethiopia amid 1986, however this agreement was dropped after the C-130's pilot was blamed by the Ethiopian government for shooting a military zone. The Australian Federal Police in the long run accused two individuals of cheating the Commonwealth and scheme in connection to these endeavors to discard the C-130As. In the long run, four of the C-130As were sold to Aboitiz Air Transport Corporation in May 1988 and another four were procured by the Fowler Aeronautical Corporation the following year. Two of the staying three flying machine were held by the RAAF for preparing and legacy purposes, and the last C-130A was rejected. 

In November 1978, a C-130H turned into the principal Australian Hercules to arrive in Antarctica, at McMurdo Sound. In Januaryâ February 1979, two No.Â 37 Squadron C-130Es emptied Australian and other remote government office staff from Tehran, in a matter of seconds before the breakdown of imperial guideline amid the Iranian Revolution. Amid April 1982, a C-130H was fitted with airborne firefighting gear gained from the United States Forest Service for preliminaries purposes; a few Hercules later utilized this hardware to battle bushfires. On 5 April 1983, 23 of the RAAF's Hercules played out a development trip over Sydney; the rest of the airplane was to have taken an interest in this flight yet was occupied to lead a pursuit and-salvage task. The Hercules' twelve-hour continuance and capacity to drop survival hardware over land or ocean made it a valuable air ship for such missions. In 1986, No.Â 37 Squadron transported the Popemobiles amid John PaulÂ II's voyage through Australia; its other strange cargoes have incorporated a Murray Gray stud bull introduced to the Chinese Government in 1973, kangaroos and sheep for Malaysia, and archeological shows from China. 

In February 1987, Nos.Â 36 and 37 Squadrons joined No.Â 33 Squadron (flying Boeing 707 tanker-transports) as a major aspect of a re-shaped No.Â 86 Wing under the recently settled Air Lift Group (renamed Air Mobility Group in April 2014). In May that year four C-130s flew a rifle organization of the first Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, from Townsville to Norfolk Island amid Operation Morris Dance, the Australian Defense Force's reaction to the first of the 1987 Fijian upsets; the fighters in this manner set out onto RAN warships by helicopter. In 1988, No.Â 37 Squadron's Hercules accomplished without 200,000Â accident flying hours. No.Â 36 Squadron accomplished sans 100,000Â accident flying hours on the C-130H in 1990. Individuals from the voyaging open experienced flying by Hercules in 1989, when the Australian Government utilized the C 707s for transport amid the pilots' question that abridged tasks by the two household carriers; the subsequent spike in operational hours required No.Â 486 Squadron sending separations to a few areas all through the nation to adapt to expanded support requests. By the late 1980s, some C-130 support errands had been re-appropriated to business firms, and Air New Zealand won a four-year warehouse upkeep contract in 1990. 

Following the Iraqi intrusion of Kuwait in August 1990, No.Â 86 Wing arranged to convey five C-130s to the Middle East to empty 3,000Â Australian natives from Saudi Arabia if Iraq likewise assaulted that nation. An activity to fly about 95Â Australians and New Zealanders legitimately out of Iraq and Kuwait was likewise arranged, however would have just been led if all else fails because of the extraordinary risks included. These departure flights were not required as Iraq did not attack Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq left by street. A proposition to send a portion of the Hercules as a feature of Australia's commitment to the resulting Gulf War was additionally dismissed in late 1990 as the flying machine must be held for possible later use in the event that battling on the Pacific island of Bougainville intensified and required a clearing activity. After Operation Desert Storm started in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at preparation to send to Saudi Arabia in the event that Australian residents must be emptied; these flying machine moved to Singapore on 29 January and came back to Australia toward the beginning of February. Different Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the district from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and furthermore transported a maritime Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons accomplished a fantastic aggregate of 500,000 mishap free flying hours; Lockheed introduced No. 86 Wing with a trophy to remember the achievement. 

A unit of Hercules from Nos.Â 36 and 37 Squadrons upheld INTERFET tasks in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000. At the point when savagery broke out after the East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum on 30Â August 1999, C-130H forays were flown into the then-Indonesian territory from 6 to 14Â September to empty United Nations work force just as other remote natives and East Timorese exiles. Four C-130E forays were likewise led to drop nourishment and other philanthropic supplies to evacuees on 17 and 18Â September. On 19Â September a C-130 dropped a Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) group close to the East Timorese capital of Dili in front of the landing of the fundamental INTERFET constrain the following day. From 20Â September, thirteen RAAF Hercules (assigned No.Â 86 Wing DetachmentÂ B) and transport air ship from a few different nations flew troops and supplies into East Timor. These air ship additionally dropped helpful supplies to exiles who had fled to precipitous locales. The poor state of most East Timorese landing strips and the potential risk of being terminated upon by genius Indonesian civilian army were consistent perils all through this task. 

The help plans for the RAAF's Hercules were changed amid 1999 and 2000. On 24Â August 1999, the preparation areas of Nos. 33, 36 and 37 Squadrons and No. 503 Wing were joined to frame No. 285 Squadron. This new squadron was alloted obligation regarding preparing aircrew to work C-130s and Boeing 707s utilizing pilot test programs, just as airplane incidentally allocated to the unit from the operational squadrons. Resigned Hercules have additionally been utilized to prepare loadmasters. In May 2000, overwhelming support of the C-130s, recently completed by No.Â 2 AD (changed as No.Â 503 Wing in July 1992) was contracted out to Qantas. Since the retirement of the Boeing 707 from RAAF administration in June 2008, No.Â 285 Squadron has been devoted to C-130 preparing. 

From late 2001, Hercules started flying into Afghanistan to help the SAS squadron sent as a major aspect of Operation Slipper, Australia's commitment to the War in Afghanistan. Five Hercules of Nos.Â 36 and 37 Squadrons joined aid projects following the Bali Bombings in October 2002. In February 2003, a unit of Hercules from No.Â 36 Squadron was sent to the Middle East as a major aspect of the Australian commitment to the attack of Iraq. These flying machine landed on 10Â February, and started flying transport fights twelve days after the fact. The C-130s were the primary type of transport used to move Australian staff and hardware in the auditorium when the episode of battling on 19Â March. Amid the intrusion the Hercules bolstered SAS activities in western Iraq, one being the primary Coalition flying machine to arrive at Al Asad Airbase after it was verified by unique powers work force on 12Â April. The C-130s transported supplies and hardware to airstrips in southern Iraq to help the activities of US and British powers. As the main period of the war slowed down, Australian Hercules flew restorative supplies into Baghdad soon after the city was caught. A pivoting separation of three Hercules was in this way kept up in the Middle East to help the progressing Australian commitment to the War in Afghanistan, just as the powers positioned in Iraq. The air ship relegated to this separation amassed a sum of 20,000Â operational flying hours by March 2010. An American temporary worker going on an Australian C-130 in Iraq was murdered on 27Â June 2004 when the air ship was struck by gunfire not long after it took off from Baghdad. 

RAAF C-130s kept on supporting activities in and around Australia amid the mid 2000s. Amid April 2003 a C-130 framed piece of the power that followed the North Korean vessel "Pong Su" before it was boarded by extraordinary powers work force off the bank of New South Wales. No.Â 36 Squadron Hercules partook in Operation Sumatra Assist in the wake of the 2004 Boxing Day tidal wave; the air ship were at first used to fly supplies into the seriously harmed city of Banda Aceh. Hercules flew Australian powers into East Timor amid May 2006 after the administration of that nation mentioned help to control a military revolt and across the board brutality. In July that year one of the C-130s conveyed to the Middle East was sent to Cyprus, where it got Australians who had been cleared from Lebanon following Israeli air assaults and flew them to Turkey. 

RAAF C-130 tasks were gathered in No.Â 37 Squadron in November 2006, when No.Â 36 Squadron exchanged its C-130Hs preceding re-furnishing with Boeing C-17 Globemaster substantial transports and migrating to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. The RAAF's commitment to Operation Papua New Guinea Assist following Cyclone Guba in November 2007 included two Hercules, three Caribous, and a Globemaster. In November 2008, the RAAF recognized fifty years of Hercules task. From that year just C-130Js were conveyed to the Middle East. Four of the C-130Hs were set for possible later use at Richmond from 2009. Together with Globemasters, Hercules transported therapeutic staff and hardware to help casualties of the Christchurch tremor in February 2011. In May 2012 the administration reported as a component of the 2012â 13 Budget that the staying eight C-130Hs would be pulled back from administration a year sooner than recently planned. The flying machine were resigned on 30Â November that year. Two of the C-130Hs were held by the Air Force for presentation at RAAF Museum and for ground preparing purposes at Richmond; four were given to the Indonesian Air Force, and the RAAF was accounted for to think about choices for the transfer of the other six. When the C-130H armada was resigned, the twelve airplane had flown practically 250,000Â hours. In April 2013 the Australian government offered to sell five of the C-130Hs just as extra parts and test systems to Indonesia at beneath their fairly estimated worth. The Indonesian government acknowledged this arrangement, and it was concluded on 26 July 2013. The RAAF celebrated 800,000 Hercules flying hours in September 2014. The C-130Js had at this point collected more than 100,000 hours; they are required to stay in administration until 2030.
