His guitar playing, as a feature of the Pixies' sound, was held in high respect by faultfinders: MTV's Laurel Bowman remarked that Santiago's "sonic furrow was the key component in the Pixies' colossal nearness". 

Santiago was conceived in Manila, Philippines, on June 10, 1965, the third of six children of an anesthesiologist. In 1972, when President Marcos proclaimed military law, the family moved to the United States. Following two years in Yonkers, New York, the family moved to Longmeadow, Massachusetts, where Santiago went to Longmeadow High School and moved on from Wilbraham and Monson Academy in 1983. His first involvement with a melodic instrument was playing a Hammond organ at eight years old, however he never paid attention to on the instrument since he needed to impart it to five siblings. Santiago originally played a guitar at nine years old after he saw a traditional guitar holding tight his most seasoned sibling's divider for adornment. The primary tune he figured out how to play was The Velvet Underground's "Shake and Roll". 

As a youngster, Santiago wound up inspired by PC programming, naming his first program "Iggy" and his second "Fly" after punk rocker Iggy Pop. He took part in a cycle ride over the United States in help of philanthropy, however on finishing it didn't try to gather the support's cash. 

Subsequent to moving on from secondary school in 1983, Santiago learned at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He stayed without a noteworthy as long as the college would allow him to, however in the end picked financial aspects. He met Charles Thompson, a human sciences understudy and the future Pixies frontman, after he heard Thompson and his flat mate playing their guitars. Santiago hurried home to gather his guitar, and was before long playing "non-blues-scale, non-spread tune shake" with Thompson. 

Santiago and Thompson shared a room toward the beginning of the second semester. Santiago before long acquainted his new flat mate with 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie. He later reviewed their time together in school: "Charles and I had a suite at the school dormitory. We'd go to appears, I saw Black Flag and Angst. At first, I think we simply preferred one another. I noticed immediately that he was playing musicÂ ... He'd compose them [the songs], and I'd toss my thoughts on the guitar." In their second year of school, Thompson ventured out to Puerto Rico as a trade understudy. Following a half year there living with a "peculiar, psycho flat mate," Thompson sent Santiago a letter with the words "We gotta do it, right now is an ideal opportunity, Joe, we gotta pursue our fantasies"; Santiago answered, saying "Indeed, presently's the time." Upon accepting this answer, Thompson chose to come back to Amherst to begin a musical gang with Santiago. 

Upon Thompson's arrival to Massachusetts, the pair dropped out of school and moved to Boston. They both took transitory occupations in distribution centers, with Santiago working for a butcher square organization. In January 1986, Thompson framed the Pixies with Santiago. Thompson gave Santiago the decision of bass or lead guitar; Santiago played lead. The pair touched base at a name after Santiago chose the word arbitrarily from a lexicon and enjoyed the definition, "wicked little mythical people." They selected Kim Deal seven days after the fact subsequent to setting an ordered promotion in a Boston paper for a bassist "into HÃ¼sker DÃ¼ and Peter, Paul and Mary." Drummer David Lovering was later enlisted on proposal from Deal's better half. 

The Pixies practiced all through 1986, and started performing around Boston in late 1986 and amid 1987. Santiago met his future spouse, Linda Mallari, when he sat adjacent to her after a 1987 Pixies appear at The Rat. Mallari noticed their common Filipino lineage and proposed they compose music together. She at that point offered to join the Pixies, however Santiago answered, "We as of now have a chick in the band." Throughout Santiago's time with the Pixies, the two frequently got together to compose melodies and drink martinis, yet they didn't discharge any material. As per Santiago, they "separated a few times" right off the bat in their relationship. 

The Pixies marked to the English free record name 4AD in 1987. On meeting the leader of the name, Ivo Watts-Russell, Santiago commented: "All I care about is that you make me well known in the Philippines since every one of the chicks are actually beautiful". Watts-Russell later said "that is most likely all I at any point heard Joey truly state," and at that point, Santiago's quietness had been noted by those near the band. The Pixies' first discharge, "Please Pilgrim", included his trademark rakish lead guitar on tracks, for example, "The Holiday Song" and "Vamos". 

After the band's next two collections, "Surfer Rosa" (1988) and "Doolittle" (1989), the connection between the band individuals wound up stressed; the Pixies were continually visiting and had discharged three collections in two years. Amid their homecoming Boston show, on the post-"Doolittle" "Fuck or Fight" visit, Santiago crushed up his instrument and raged offstage. The band declared a break soon a short time later. Amid this time, Santiago visited the Grand Canyon to "get himself." After the band reconvened in 1990, Santiago added to the band's later discharges, "Bossanova" (1990) and "Trompe le Monde" (1991), receiving a surf guitar style in the previous. The Pixies inevitably separated in 1992, generally because of strains among Francis and Deal, in spite of the fact that the separation was not openly declared until 1993. 

After the separation of the Pixies, Santiago went into a misery for the main couple of years yet stayed on great terms with bandmate Black Francis (who before long received the name Frank Black). Dark, who was recording his 1993 presentation collection, "Blunt Black", reached Santiago to ask whether he would contribute lead guitar. Santiago concurred, and he and Mallari drove from their home in Florida to Los Angeles. The couple wound up moving into Black's old condo in L.A. spontaneously. Santiago played lead guitar on various Frank Black's performance collections, including "Young person of the Year" (1994), and contributed lead guitar to Steve Westfield's 1994 collection "Ruined". He likewise shaped The Martinis a year later with Mallari. Their recorded yield before the finish of the 1990s contained a solitary tune, oneself recorded "Free" (1995), which showed up on the film soundtrack of "Realm Records". The band played live just sporadically until 2001. 

In the mid-1990s, Santiago started to investigate sound altering programming. Subsequent to forming for a few autonomous movies, including "Wrongdoing and Punishment in Suburbia" in 2000 (where he teamed up again with Black), Santiago co-scored the Fox Network TV arrangement "Undeclared" with Michael Andrews. He kept on contributing lead guitar to collections, working together with Charles Douglas on his 2004 collection "Statecraft". He scored the 2003 film "The Low Budget Time Machine" and composed two melodies, "Birthday Video" and "Phony Purse," for the Showtime TV arrangement "Weeds" in 2005. 

Mallari and Santiago kept on composing new material as a major aspect of the Martinis, however never again played live. Their introduction collection, "Stricken", took two years to compose and was discharged in 2004; the pair teamed up with various artists, including drummer Josh Freese, amid the account. Santiago depicted the collection as "a great deal poppier and quirkier" than the band's past material. The band all the while discharged "The Smitten Sessions", a restricted version EP. 

After the Pixies separated in 1993, Santiago had kept in contact with each band part. In the mid year of 2003, Black chose to start rejoining the Pixies and called Santiago first. Santiago later clarified: "He called me on my cellphone and I was in Cape Cod seeing family. He said in this shy voice, 'Hello Joey, uh, you been hearin' these gossipy tidbits that we're getting back together? Hmm, I wonder who began it?' I go, 'Charles, did you do that?' and he goes, 'No doubt.'" Santiago at that point reached Lovering and Deal to educate them of Black's choice and by the late spring of 2004 the band had rejoined. DreamWorks asked the Pixies in mid 2004 to make a tune for the "Shrek 2" soundtrack. They concurred, and early forms of this new tune were recorded in Santiago's storm cellar. With his soundtrack experience, the band, in the expressions of Deal, "stirred it up a bit in Joey's Pro Tools thing", before submitting it to the studio. DreamWorks rejected the melody, so the band discharged it as a solitary, "Bam Thwok". 

Beside the Pixies and The Martinis, Santiago scored the soundtrack of the narrative "Brilliant City" in 2006. He marked with the business sound organization Elias Arts around the same time, and concentrated on creating music for TV advertisements. In a March 2006 Billboard.com talk with, he expelled the likelihood of another Pixies collection for the present: "I'd possibly be intrigued in the event that it occurs in a natural way; if every one of our timetables are adjusted and we're all inclination it. That is the main motivation to do it." Santiago likewise played an advantage show for drummer Wally Ingram in February 2007 as a feature of The Martinis; the band's first gig for a long time. 

Santiago portrays his guitar playing as "precise and twisted," "all got from guitar minutes that advantage my ears up". Prominent in his style is the manner by which he utilizes twisting and criticism to leave spaces open. A genuine precedent is the introduction of There Goes My Gun. He qualities quite a bit of his style to melodies he appreciated when first learning the guitar, for example, The Beatles' "Savoy Truffle", where "George Harrison played that twisted note that I experienced passionate feelings for and later drained it for all it was value." He utilized such strategies with the Pixies: "Doolittle's" "Dead" starts with Santiago's guitar "cackling" on an E-level like "an injured creature". As Santiago was learning the guitar, he considered himself to be an unsure novice, and still talks about an absence of trust in his playing. 

Santiago, instead of tuning in to well known radio, acquired shake and move records from the open library as he was growing up; he originally found Les Paul and Jimi Hendrix, who prompted jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery. Santiago later remarked on Montgomery's impact: "And that is the point at which I stated, 'Ah, that is a snare. That is some hooky stuff in the jazz world'". He found jazz and blue grass craftsmen, for example, Joe Pass and Chet Atkins in the wake of contemplating the liner notes of collections. Santiago was legitimately impacted by the "Hendrix harmony", the sharp ninth overwhelming harmony which, in the expressions of creator Ben Sisario, "tapped a shrouded anger that coordinated the awfulness of Thompson's shout". As an adolescent, Santiago additionally tuned in to great shake and protopunk craftsmen, for example, The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Velvet Underground and Iggy Pop. 

The stage tricks of Santiago regularly appeared differently in relation to his for the most part calm attitude; he frequently tried different things with his guitar and hardware amid tunes. Arrangement's significant other, John Murphy, said that amid exhibitions of "Vamos", which highlights guitar criticism all through, Santiago used to "whack the poo out of his amp", frequently grabbing the speaker and moving it around. Amid certain performances, Santiago would frequently destroy the guitar up to his mouth and break guitar strings with his teeth. 

As on September 16, 2016, Pixies reported by means of their online life accounts that Joey Santiago had registered with a restoration focus to treat his liquor and medication issues.
