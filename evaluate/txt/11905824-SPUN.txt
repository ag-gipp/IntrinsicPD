In August 2007, Phil Cohen, maker, planner, and diversion executive for "Selling out", talked about the troubles in building up a "Divine force of War" amusement for a cell phone. Cohen said that albeit pleasant, the best test was making a solitary tileset and palette swapping plan that was sufficiently various to depict different conditions with just a few hundred kilobytes, and that met arrangement maker Santa Monica Studio's exclusive expectations. He composed the underlying structure report among September and October 2005, and returned to it in August 2006, the month advancement began. The variants for top of the line handsets were finished in April 2007, with definite forms for low-end handsets finished by June 2007. The porting group adjusted the amusement to more than 200 handsets in only weeks.

Levi Buchanan of IGN called it "the genuine article third diversion in the executioner establishment".
