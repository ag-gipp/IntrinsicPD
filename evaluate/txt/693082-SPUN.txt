In the amusement, players control Sonic the Hedgehog, who must stop arrangement adversary Doctor Robotnik from subjugating the populace in a mammoth pinball-like component. The amusement is set in a progression of pinball machine-like conditions, and Sonic goes about as a pinball for most of the diversion. 

The amusement was created by the American staff of Sega Technical Institute, as the Japanese staff was busy with creating "Sonic the Hedgehog 3" and "Sonic and Knuckles". At the point when Sega the executives understood that "Sonic 3" would not be finished in time for the 1993 Christmas shopping season, they appointed another "Sonic" amusement that would be.

The insidious researcher Doctor Robotnik has fabricated a substantial post over a fountain of liquid magma to transform the creatures of planet Mobius into robot slaves. The magma inside the spring of gushing lava fills both the stronghold and the pinball machine-like safeguard frameworks that go about as fortresses. The spring of gushing lava is kept in stable condition by a progression of Chaos Emeralds. Accordingly, Sonic the Hedgehog and his companion Tails mount a flying attack on the fortification just to be trapped by the stronghold's guns. Sonic is thumped into the profound waters that encompass the well of lava, however figures out how to abstain from suffocating and surfaces in the caverns underneath the fortification. From that point, Sonic penetrates the fortification's resistances, absconds with the Chaos Emeralds, and liberates the creatures of Mobius. Without the Chaos Emeralds, a gigantic emission starts to wreck the fortification. While Robotnik makes a departure endeavor on a huge carrier, Sonic seeks after him and figures out how to crush the air ship, bringing about the pair plunging to the fountain of liquid magma beneath. Tails figures out how to safeguard Sonic in the nick of time, while Robotnik falls into the fountain of liquid magma, which sinks into the sea and detonates. 

"Sonic Spinball" is a pinball game in which the player controls Sonic the Hedgehog, who goes about as the pinball. Most of the diversion happens inside the "Pinball Defense System", which takes after a progression of expansive pinball machines. The amusement includes four dimensions, each containing various flippers that can be utilized to point Sonic's direction and dispatch him through the dimension. Sonic can be moved while airborne with contribution from the directional cushion, which can be utilized for better situating following a contact with a guard or target or when Sonic is sliding toward the channel, guards or flippers. 

The objective of each dimension is to gather the majority of the Chaos Emeralds and therefore rout the recently open supervisor situated at the highest point of the dimension. Some Chaos Emeralds are closed off by hindrances that require Sonic to hit certain switches or guards so as to make a reasonable way. The manager at the highest point of each dimension requires a particular procedure to vanquish. A "status strip" at the highest point of the screen gives clues to crushing managers just as empowering messages when the player gains ground. The strip likewise tells the player what number of Chaos Emeralds are left to gather in a dimension. Following the thrashing of a manager adversary, a reward round is started. These rounds are appeared Sonic playing a normal pinball machine.

In the event that the tilt shake is utilized over and over again, be that as it may, all flippers will bolt out, leaving the ball to tumble down the channel. At the point when the objective of the reward round is satisfied, or if every one of the three balls fall through the flippers, the reward round will end, and the following dimension will initiate. At the point when the majority of the diversion's Chaos Emeralds are gathered and every one of the four manager foes are vanquished, the player wins. 

Sonic begins the diversion with three lives. A life is lost when Sonic falls through a channel. An additional life can be earned by gathering 20,000,000 points, which can be aggregated by hitting guards, exploring through circles, gathering rings and crushing foe characters. 

"Sonic Spinball" was created by for the most part American staff from Sega Technical Institute while the Japanese staff were delivering "Sonic the Hedgehog 3" and "Sonic and Knuckles" (at that point conceptualized as a solitary diversion). "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" was credited with boosting offers of the Sega Genesis in the 1992 Christmas shopping season. Sega of America's administration understood that the following "Sonic the Hedgehog" title would not be prepared until one year from now and appointed another diversion that could be finished in time for the 1993 Christmas season. 

Sega's exploration group recommended that the "Gambling club Night Zone" of "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" was among the most well known dimensions in the amusement. This gave Peter Morawiec, the diversion's creator, with a general course of the forthcoming amusement. With a thought set up, the designers imagined a method for separating the pleasant parts of this single dimension and developing them extensively enough to shape an idea around which a whole diversion could be based. Morawiec drew motivation from "Pinball Dreams", a diversion discharged for the Amiga in 1992, to consolidate pinball mechanics with the ongoing interaction of "Sonic the Hedgehog". Working together with three associates, Morawiec structured essential activitys delineating Sonic as a pinball. The movements were exhibited to Sega's senior administration, who affirmed the task. 

The improvement group realized that the diversion would need to be finished in less than a year to be prepared in time for the 1993 Christmas season; a calendar Morawiec considered "tight" for an amusement which expected to profit by the arrangement's newly discovered prevalence in North America. So as to accelerate creation, Sega sent veteran staff from Japan to aid advancement, including normal "Sonic the Hedgehog" craftsman Katsuhiko Sato. Regardless of the exchange of these staff, the amusement was as yet not anticipated to be finished in time. Thus, Sega Technical Institute staff chose to change the amusement's modifying language from gathering to C; an unordinary decision for Genesis diversions at the time. Everything considered, Morawiec conceded that the decision to move far from customary low level computing construct caused outline rate and enhancement issues, yet significantly quickened the improvement procedure. Over the course of about 61 days between mid-June and August 1993, the task advanced from being a generally playable form with no impact recognition frameworks or character movements, to a completely finished amusement. 

Preceding the diversion was because of ship, the group was educated that Sega did not possess the privileges of the "Sonic the Hedgehog" subject tune. Morawiec reviewed that there was a mayhem among the group after Hirokazu Yasuhara, the lead architect on Sonic Team, clarified that the subject tune was claimed by Japanese band Dreams Come True. Thus, Morawiec entrusted the group's lead arranger, Howard Drossin, to make another topic inside roughly two hours. 

Morawiec trusted that the amusement would confront "acknowledgment challenges" from the two fans and the gaming media, as "Sonic the Hedgehog Pinball" strayed far from the customary platforming sort. Subsequent to returning home to the United States from Europe, Morawiec was amazed to find that the diversion had sold well, and was satisfied that it profited by the establishment's prevalence. In any case, he lamented that the group had needed time to "clean" the amusement legitimately. After the Game Gear title "Sonic Drift" got poor audits in Japan, Sega discharged a 8-bit port of "Sonic Spinball" for the Game Gear in its place worldwide in late 1994. It was additionally discharged for the Master System in Brazil and Europe in 1995. The 8-bit adaptation is generally indistinguishable to the Genesis amusement, though with minimized visuals and unique, all the more platforming-focused extra stages.
