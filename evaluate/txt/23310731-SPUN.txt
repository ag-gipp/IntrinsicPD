In Pasadena, Cameron kept running into a previous associate, who welcomed her to visit the huge American Craftsman-style house where he was at present cabin, 1003 Orange Grove Avenue, otherwise called "The Parsonage". The house was supposed in light of the fact that its rent was claimed by Jack Parsons, a scientific genius who had been an establishing individual from the JPL and who was additionally a passionate adherent of Thelema, another religious development established by English soothsayer Aleister Crowley in 1904.

In the winter of 1947, Cameron ventured out from New York to Paris on board the "SS America" with the expectation of considering workmanship at the AcadÃ©mie de la Grande ChaumiÃ¨re, which she trusted would concede her with a letter of suggestion from Pasadena's Art Center School. She additionally needed to visit England and meet with Crowley and disclose to him Parsons' Babalon Working. Cameron learned upon her entry in Paris that Crowley had kicked the bucket and that she had not been admitted to the school.

Her psychological soundness was disintegrating, and she ended up persuaded that an atomic test on Eniwetok Atoll would result in the demolition of the California coast. There is uncertain proof that she was regulated in a mental ward amid this period, before having a concise illicit relationship with African-American jazz player Leroy Booth, a relationship that would have been unlawful at the time. Sooner or later in this period, she remained with the Thelemite Wilfred Talbot Smith and his significant other, in spite of the fact that he suspected that she had "bats in the spire" and disregarded what he depicted as her "Frantic Mental Meanderings".

From that point she and her girl moved to a little cottage on North Genesee Avenue in the West Hollywood region of Los Angeles, which at the time had turned out to be devastated and connected with wrongdoing, sex stores, and grown-up cinemas; she stayed there for an amazing remainder. 

By the mid-1980s, Cameron was concentrating to a more noteworthy degree on her family life, especially in caring for her grandkids, who were known to go joyriding in her jeep. Neighbors review her playing a Celtic harp in her greenery enclosure and gradually strolling her canine around the square while smoking a joint of pot.

Raleigh's "Lady and Superwoman", taped her very own perusing of it, and sent duplicates to her companions and neighborhood open radio for communicate. All through these different profound interests, she held confidence in the Thelemic thoughts of Crowley. 

Just as engaging old companions who came to visit her in her home, Cameron additionally met with more youthful mediums, for example, the Thelemite William Breeze and the mechanical artist Genesis P-Orridge.

Her body was incinerated and its powder were dispersed in the Mojave Desert. A remembrance occasion was held at Venice's Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center in August. 

Cameron liked to be referred to by her surname as a mononym. As per student of history of Thelema Martin P. Starr, Cameron's "commanding identity couldn't stream opponents of any sort". The style author Tim Blanks noticed that Cameron was "an appealling lady" dynamic in the mid-twentieth century "macho craftsmanship world", and that it was not astounding how "charming and hazardous" she more likely than not appeared to Hopper and Stockwell. 

Stockwell portrayed Cameron as "an, exceptionally extreme identity, yet extremely entrancing". Believing her to be "an unmitigated witch", Hopper depicted her as having an "irresistible identity" through her essence; she was somebody "that you knew [was] unique and [she] had an attractive quality that you needed to be nearer to".

He trusted that both "enthusiasm and art" could be found in her draftsmanship, however that it likewise showed "a straightforwardness that is difficult to identify with in our post-amusing minute". He likewise examined her lost multi-shaded watercolor works of art that were included in Harrington's "The Wormwood Star", recommending that they were likened to a storyboard for an unrealised movie by the executive Alejandro Jodorowsky.

In later years, Cameron would regularly be incorrectly marked a Beat craftsman since she occupied huge numbers of indistinguishable groups of friends from unmistakable Beat artists and journalists. Dismissing this mark, Kansa rather portrayed Cameron as "a pre-Beat bohemian, whose heart lay in Romanticism".

In 1995, her work of art "Peyote Vision" was incorporated as a feature of a presentation on "Beat Culture and the New American" held at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. A portion of her works of art were then displayed close by those of Crowley and different Thelemites for the 2001 show "Impressions of a New Eon", held at the Eleven Seven Gallery in California's Long Beach.

In 2014, another review, titled "Cameron: Songs for the Witch Woman", was held at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. That year, the U.K.- based distributer Fulgur Esoterica discharged a book including pictures of Cameron's works of art and Parsons' sonnets.

Cameron's tasteful likewise affected the style world, fashioners Pamela Skaist-Levy and Gela Nash-Taylor recognizing Cameron as a fractional motivation for their Skaist-Taylor name. 

Cameron's life was brought to more extensive consideration through the distribution of two memoirs about Parsons: John Carter's "Sex and Rockets" and George Pendle's "Bizarre Angel".

Kansa had gone through right around three years in the U.S. investigating the book, talking with a considerable lot of the individuals who knew Cameron, including a few who passed on not long after. Kansa expressed that the majority of those whom he met "were gigantically liberal with their time and memories" yet that "one of Cameron's kookier companions" had started making claims that Kansa was not a biographer but rather was extremely an operator of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Writing in the "Los Angeles Review of Books", Steffie Nelson noticed that Kansa did "his due steadiness finding Cameron's youth associates and companions" and yet was reproachful of the absence of sources or commentaries.
