Pileup format

Pileup format is a text-based format for summarizing the base calls of aligned reads to a reference sequence. This format facilitates visual display of SNP/indel calling and alignment. It was first used by
Tony Cox and Zemin Ning at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, but became widely known through its implementation within the SAMtools software suite.

Each line consists of 5 (or optionally 6) tab-separated columns:


This is an optional column. If present, the ASCII value of the character minus 33 gives the mapping Phred quality of each of the bases in the previous column 5. This is similar to quality encoding in the FASTQ format.

There is no standard file extension for a Pileup file, but .pileup is commonly used.
