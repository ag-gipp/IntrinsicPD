He is best known for his 1950s coordinated efforts with screenwriter Nigel Kneale, most remarkably the "Quatermass" serials and their 1954 adjustment of George Orwell's tragic novel "Nineteen Eighty-Four". 

In the wake of contemplating engineering and afterward show, Cartier started his vocation as a screenwriter and after that movie executive in Berlin, working for UFA Studios. After a short spell in the United States he moved to the United Kingdom in 1935. At first neglecting to pick up a decent footing in the British film industry, he started working for BBC Television in the lae 1930s (among different preparations he was associated with the creation of Rehearsal for a Drama, BBC 1939). The episode of war, be that as it may, implied that his agreement was ended; his TV play The Dead Eye was ceased in the generation arrange. After the war, he sometimes worked for British movies before he was again enlisted by the BBC in 1952. He before long wound up one of the open administration supporter's driving chiefs and proceeded to create and coordinate more than 120 preparations in the following 24 years, finishing his TV vocation with the play "Loyalties" in 1976. 

Dynamic in both sensational programming and musical drama, Cartier won what could be compared to a BAFTA in 1957 for his work in the previous, and one of his operatic preparations was given an honor at the 1962 Salzburg Festival. The British Film Institute's "Screenonline" site portrays him as "a genuine pioneer of TV", while the faultfinder Peter Black once composed that: "No one was inside a mile of Rudolph Cartier in the trap of making an image on a TV screen appear as wide and as profound as CinemaScope." 

Conceived in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (presently Austria), Cartier at first concentrated to turn into an engineer, before changing profession ways and selecting to ponder show at the Vienna Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. There he was instructed by Max Reinhardt, who demonstrated a noteworthy effect on Cartier. Reinhardt thought of a content as being like a melodic score, which ought to be deciphered by a chief similarly as a performer translating a bit of musicâa methodology with which Cartier concurred. 

Cartier wound up associated with the film business in 1929, when he effectively presented a content to an organization situated in Berlin, Germany. He at that point turned into a staff scriptwriter for UFA Studios, the essential German film organization of the time, for which he chipped away at wrongdoing movies and spine chillers. While at UFA, he worked with noted journalists, executives and makers including Ewald AndrÃ© Dupont and Erich Pommer. In 1933 he turned into a movie chief, regulating the spine chiller "Unsichtbare Gegner" for maker Sam Spiegel. 

A similar year as "Unsichtbare Gegner" was discharged, the Nazis came to control in Germany, and the Jewish Cartier left the nation. A few individuals from Cartier's family who had stayed in Europe, including his mom, later kicked the bucket in the Holocaust. Empowered by a UFA partner, Billy Wilder, to come to Hollywood, Cartier changed his surname and moved to the United States. In any case, in contrast to Wilder, Cartier did not discover achievement in America, and in 1935 he moved once more, to the United Kingdom. 

Minimal further is recorded of Cartier's vocation until after the Second World War, when he started composing storylines for a few minor British movies. He likewise filled in as a film maker, managing a 1951 short film adjustment of the Sherlock Holmes story "The Man with the Twisted Lip". Cartier returned for an opportunity to the United States, where he examined generation strategies in the new mechanism of TV. 

In 1952, Michael Barry, with whom Cartier had taken a shot at a prematurely ended undertaking in 1948, turned into the new Head of Drama at BBC Television and talked with Cartier for a post as a staff TV maker in the show office, an occupation which likewise included coordinating. At his meeting, Cartier revealed to Barry that he thought his specialization's yield was "shocking", and that TV dramatization required "new contents and another methodology". In a 1990 meeting about his profession, he disclosed to BBC Two's "The Late Show" that the BBC dramatization division had "required me like water in the desert". Barry shared a considerable lot of Cartier's perspectives on the need to improve TV show, and he contracted him for the maker's activity. 

Cartier's first BBC TV generation was a play entitled "Bolt to the Heart", transmitted on the night of 20 July 1952. It was at first adjusted via Cartier from Albrecht Goes' tale "Unruhige Nacht", yet Barry felt that the exchange was "excessively Germanic" and allocated dramatization division staff scriptwriter Nigel Kneale to alter the content. "Bolt to the Heart" was the first of numerous joint efforts between the pair, who appreciated amid the following couple of years an exceptionally profitable working relationship, regardless of significant inventive differences every so often. Cartier and Kneale were an imperative nearness in the British TV show of the time and were, as indicated by TV history specialist Lez Cooke, "in charge of acquainting a totally new measurement with TV dramatization in the right on time to mid-1950s". 

Cartier and Kneale's first significant creation was the six-section sequential "The Quatermass Experiment", communicate in the mid year of 1953. A sci-fi story, it relates the sending of the primary people into space by Professor Bernard Quatermass and the outcomes when an outsider nearness attacks the team's rocket amid its flight and comes back to Earth in the body of the one remaining crewmember, having retained the consciousnesses and destroyed the collections of the other two. A basic and prevalent achievement, "The Quatermass Experiment" has been portrayed by the British Film Institute's Screenonline site as "a standout amongst the most powerful arrangement of the 1950s". Cartier's commitment to the sequential's prosperity was featured in his 1994 tribute in "The Times" paper, which additionally called the sequential "a milestone in British TV show as much for its visual creative energy with respect to its capacity to stun and aggravate". 

The accomplishment of "The Quatermass Experiment" prompted two spin-offs, "Quatermass II" (1955) and "Quatermass and the Pit" (1958â 59), both delivered and coordinated via Cartier and composed by Kneale. Both were effective and widely praised, and Cartier's generation chip away at them turned out to be progressively goal-oriented. For "Quatermass II", he pre-shot a lot of material on area, utilizing 35Â mm film, opening the dramatization out from a bound studio setting with the most eager area shooting yet endeavored in British TV. Cartier, with his past experience as a movie chief, especially delighted in chipping away at these film style taped scenes. 

The intrigue of the "Quatermass" serials has been credited by the Museum of Broadcast Communications to the portrayal of "another scope of gendered fears about Britain's after war and post-pioneer security. Accordingly, or maybe essentially due to Kneale and Cartier's powerful mix of sci-fi and strong drama, groups of onlookers were charmed." The Screenonline site recommends that the visual effect of Cartier's understanding of Kneale's contents was a main consideration in their prosperity, which it credits to their "creativity, mass intrigue and dynamism... "The Quatermass Experiment" turned into a milestone of sci-fi and the foundation of the class on British TV." 

Beside the "Quatermass" serials, Cartier and Kneale worked together on a few coincidental dramatizations, including scholarly and showy adjustments of "Wuthering Heights" (6 December 1953) and "The Moment of Truth" (10 March 1955), just as Kneale's own "The Creature" (30 January 1955). Of specific note was their joint effort on an adjustment of George Orwell's epic "Nineteen Eighty-Four", initially communicate on 12 December 1954, viewed as Cartier's most acclaimed work. "The Times'" survey the day after its communicate noticed its "striking quality... the two minutes' loathe was, for example, a superbly riotious blow out of malignance." The generation additionally pulled in impressive debate. There were questions solicited in the House from Commons concerning a portion of the realistic scenes of frightfulness in the play, and the BBC got a few phone calls compromising Cartier's life if the second live execution, booked for 16 December, proceeded. The BBC paid attention to these dangers enough to dole out him guardians. Cartier seemed live on TV himself to protect the creation in a studio banter, and in the end the Board of Governors of the BBC casted a ballot that the second execution ought to proceed as arranged. The generation had at this point gotten the support of the Duke of Edinburgh, who remarked amid a discourse to the Royal Society of Arts that he and the Queen had watched and appreciated the principal execution. 

"Nineteen Eighty-Four" had been a triumph, however it was likewise a standout amongst the most costly TV dramatizations at any point made in the UK. Cartier regularly spent a lot of cash on his creations. Prior in 1954, Michael Barry had intensely censured him for the cash and assets he had exhausted in an adjustment of "Rebecca". In an update composed after that generation's transmission, Barry advised Cartier for his over-aggressive creation: 

The execution of "Rebecca" appears to me to have taken us further into the threat territory as opposed to demonstrating any improvement. I am unfit to guard when departmental expenses and scene loads are in an intense express the heap forced by "Rebecca" on Design and Supply and the use upon additional items and outfits... the immense zone of the lobby and the stairway never advocated the incredible consumption of exertion required in structure and one is left with an unmistakable impression of achieving a point where the division must be blamed for not realizing what it is doing. 

In spite of Barry's worries, Cartier kept on working effectively in TV, and at the 1957 Guild of Television Producers and Directors Awards (later known as the British Academy Television Awards, or BAFTAs) he was the victor of the Drama classification. He made a short come back to filmmaking in 1958 when he coordinated the element "Enthusiastic Summer", however he saw himself fundamentally as a TV executive, and it remained his most loved medium. "The substance of TV is that you can control the watcher's reaction to an a lot more noteworthy degree than other media license," he told "The Times" in 1958. 

Cartier additionally coordinated a few musical shows for the BBC, a class for which he had an incredible energy. He supervised adjustments of set up musical dramas, for example, "Salome" (1957) and "Carmen" (1962) just as unique creations composed particularly for TV. "Tobias and the Angel", composed for the BBC by Sir Arthur Bliss and Christopher Hassall and delivered via Cartier in 1960, won the Merit Award in the Salzburg Opera Prize at the 1962 Salzburg Festival. 

Cartier kept on coordinating TV shows amid the 1960s, albeit after Barry ventured down as Head of Drama in 1961, he lost quite a bit of his imaginative autonomy. Barry's successor, Sydney Newman, canceled the BBC's customary maker chief job and split the duties into independent posts, leaving executives, for example, Cartier with less power over their preparations. Cartier likewise wound up allocated to coordinate scenes of customary show arrangement, in that capacity as "Maigret" and "Z-Cars". 

Cartier was as yet ready to coordinate a few striking creations amid the decade, including a number which investigated the Nazi period in Germany from which he had gotten away in 1933. These incorporated the World War II dramatizations "Cross of Iron" (1961, managing the court military of a U-Boat skipper in a British wartime captive camp) and "The July Plot" (1964, about the 1944 plot to kill Hitler), just as "Torch" (1967, about the 1933 Reichstag fire, an occasion Cartier had by and by seen). He additionally started, out of the blue, to coordinate pieces which managed the Holocaust, for example, "Specialist Korczak and the Children" ("Studio 4", 1962), concerning the Warsaw Ghetto halfway house, and "The Joel Brand Story" (1965, about Adolf Eichmann's 1944 idea to the Allies of the lives of 1 million Jews in return for 10,000 trucks). Other noteworthy 1960s creations included adjustments of "Anna Karenina" (1961, featuring Sean Connery and Claire Bloom) and "Wuthering Heights" (1962, another variant of Kneale's 1953 content, featuring Bloom and Keith Michell). "Lee Oswald â Assassin" (1966) was a show narrative recounting to the tale of Lee Harvey Oswald, in view of the Warren Commission's discoveries, while "Discussion at Night" (1969) saw the primary TV acting appearance of Alec Guinness. 

Cartier's profession proceeded into the 1970s. In 1974, he coordinated scenes of "Fall of Eagles"; and his last acknowledge sought the play "Loyalties", screened in 1976. At this point, he had chipped away at more than 120 creations for the BBC. Along these lines, he worked for a period for the BBC's "acquired show" division, prompting on which plays and arrangement may be purchased in from European supporters. All through his vocation, Cartier would not work for business TV: "I despise the possibility of my inventive work being always hindered for business reasons, " he once remarked. "I am a craftsman, not a sales rep." 

Cartier was hitched multiple times, ultimately to Margaret Pepper from 1949 until his passing. He had one little girl, Corinne, with Pepper, and another from a past marriage. Cartier kicked the bucket on 7 June 1994, at 90 years old; his passing was dominated in the media by that of Dennis Potter, another imperative figure in the historical backdrop of British TV show, who kicked the bucket around the same time. 

About the majority of Cartier's 1950s TV creations were performed live, and most of them were not recordedâhe once portrayed them as being "run with the speed of light". A few of those which do endure have been very respected by later analysts. In 2000, the British Film Institute (BFI) aggregated a rundown of the 100 Greatest British Television Programs of the twentieth century. Casted a ballot on by a gathering of industry experts, the rundown highlighted both "Nineteen Eighty-Four" and "Quatermass and the Pit". In the going with examination of every section to the rundown, "Nineteen Eighty-Four" was depicted as "An early case of the intensity of TV show... Indeed, even now, the torment arrangements hold their capacity to stun and exasperate." 

Nigel Kneale, scriptwriter of both of the Cartier shows acclaimed by the BFI, felt that the preparations would not have been as effective as they were had they been taken care of by some other executive. "I don't think any about the things I composed at that point would have come to anything much in different hands. In his they worked." Television history specialist Jason Jacobs, an instructor in film and TV learns at the University of Warwick, wrote in 2000 that Kneale and Cartier together made a totally new, progressively far reaching vision for British TV show during the 1950s. 

It was the entry of Nigel Kneale... what's more, Rudolph Cartier... that tested the personal show legitimately. Cartier is properly perceived as a noteworthy impact on the visual advancement of British TV show... Cartier and Kneale had the desire for their preparations to influence a mass crowd, and the extent of their consideration was not restricted to the 'comfortable' feel of closeness. Cartier utilizes the nearby both to uncover feelings and as a stun gadget: an all the more underminingâand maybe thrillingâtechnique than was utilized previously. 'Closeness' is reformulated via Cartier as far as his capacity and command over the watcherâno longer a piece of the family, however confined in his home. 

Cartier's spearheading utilization of an expanded number of pre-shot arrangements to open out the studio-bound, live TV show creations of the 1950s is additionally commended by Lez Cooke. "While film embeds were being utilized in TV dramatization from the mid 1950s, "Nineteen Eighty-Four" spoke to the most broad utilization of them in a TV play up to that time, and flagged Cartier's assurance to broaden the limits of TV show." Similarly, his "Times" eulogy expressed that: "when studio preparations were more often than not as static as the customary theater, he was generally regarded for an imaginative commitment to British TV show which gave it another measurement." 

Notwithstanding his 1950s creations, a few of Cartier's later works have additionally been viewed as persuasive. His 1962 generation of "Wuthering Heights" was lauded by Dennis Potter, at that point a TV commentator, who wrote in the "Every day Herald" paper that the creation "resembled a rainstorm on the level, inauspicious fields of the week's TV... The wail of the breeze against the windows, the quieted torment of Claire Bloom as the pitiable Cathy, and the chased wretchedness of Keith Mitchell as Heathcliff, made this a more than satisfactory offering of an extraordinary work." While "Screenonline" states that "Lee OswaldâAssassin" (1966) "could be contended [to be] of verifiable intrigue just", because of its premise in the defective Warren Commission report, "The Times" adulated it as being "potentially the main show narrative". 

Not the majority of Cartier's work was so all around respected; specifically, his realistic endeavors have not accomplished the dimension of applause for his TV work. In the book "America's Best, Britain's Finest: A Survey of Mixed Movies", pundit John Howard Reid says of Cartier's 1958 film "Energetic Summer": "It's difficult to trust that... anybody could make such a dull motion picture. However this is absolutely what chief Rudolph Cartier has done. I've never known about Mr Cartier or since however apparently he made this concise raid into movies from that manufactured universe of appalling close-upsâTV." 

Addressing "The Times" in 1958, Cartier clarified that TV was all the while creating as a medium, and that piece of his work was to help make the up and coming age of the individuals who might deliver TV dramatization. "The BBC is creating makers just as plays. They are feeling their way towards what TV show will one day be, and we are attempting to make an age of essayists who consider the medium." His 1994 eulogy in a similar paper made a decision about that he had been effective in making an enduring impact on later makers, portraying his 1962 creation of the musical drama "Carmen" as "a model and motivation to a more youthful age of TV makers". 

In 1990, the BBC Two expressions magazine program "The Late Show" created a release which highlighted a review of Cartier's work, incorporating another meeting with the chief examining his vocation. A modified variant of this component was screened on BBC Two under the title "Rudolph Cartier: A Television Pioneer" on 1 July 1994, trailed by a tribute screening of the enduring telerecording duplicate of the second execution of "Nineteen Eighty-Four".
