In July 1975, Fleetwood Mac's eponymous tenth collection was discharged to incredible business achievement, coming to No. 1 in the U.S. in 1976. The record's greatest hit single, "Rhiannon", gave the band broad radio presentation. At the time, Fleetwood Mac's line-up comprised of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, console player and vocalist Christine McVie, bass guitarist John McVie, and vocalist Stevie Nicks. Following a half year of relentless visiting, the McVies separated, finishing eight years of marriage. The couple quit conversing with one another socially and talked about just melodic issues. Buckingham and Nicksâwho had joined the band before 1975's "Fleetwood Mac", after guitarist Bob Welch had leftâwere having an on/off relationship that drove them to battle frequently. The team's contentions ceased just when they took a shot at melodies together. Fleetwood confronted residential issues of his own in the wake of finding that his better half Jenny, mother of his two kids, engaged in extramarital relations with his closest companion. 

Press interruptions into the band individuals' lives prompted wrong stories. Christine McVie was accounted for to be in medical clinic with a genuine ailment, while Buckingham and Nicks were announced the guardians of Fleetwood's little girl Lucy in the wake of being shot with her. The press likewise expounded on a supposed return of unique Fleetwood Mac individuals Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Jeremy Spencer for a tenth commemoration visit. In spite of false reports, the band did not switch its line-up, in spite of the fact that its individuals had no opportunity to grapple with the partitions before account for another collection started. Fleetwood has noticed the "colossal enthusiastic penances" made by everybody just to go to studio work. In mid 1976, Fleetwood Mac made some new tracks in Florida. Establishing individuals Fleetwood and John McVie abstained from the administrations of their past maker, Keith Olsen, in light of the fact that he supported a lower accentuation on the mood segment. The pair shaped an organization called Seedy Management to speak to the band's advantages. 

In February 1976, Fleetwood Mac met at the Record Plant in Sausalito, California, with enlisted engineers Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut. Creation obligations were shared by the three gatherings, while the more actually skilled Caillat was in charge of the vast majority of the designing; he withdrew from nonappearance from Wally Heider Studios in Los Angeles on the reason that Fleetwood Mac would inevitably utilize their offices. The set-up in Sausalito incorporated various little chronicle rooms in an expansive, austere wooden structure. Most band individuals griped about the studio and needed to record at their homes, however Fleetwood did not permit any moves. Christine McVie and Nicks chose to live in two apartment suites close to the city's harbor, while the male unforeseen remained at the studio's cabin in the adjoining slopes. Recording happened in a six-by-nine-meter room which incorporated a 3M 24-track tape machine, a scope of astounding receivers, and an API blending console with 550A equalizers; the last were utilized to control recurrence contrasts or a track's timbre. Despite the fact that Caillat was inspired with the set-up, he felt that the room needed mood as a result of its "extremely dead speakers" and a lot of soundproofing. 

The record's working title in Sausalito was "Yesterday's Gone". Buckingham assumed responsibility for the studio sessions to make "a pop collection". As indicated by Dashut, while Fleetwood and the McVies originated from an improvisational blues-shake foundation, the guitarist comprehended "the art of record making". Amid the developmental phases of pieces, Buckingham and Christine McVie played guitar and piano together to make the collection's fundamental structures. The last was the main traditionally prepared performer in Fleetwood Mac, however both shared a comparative feeling of musicality. At the point when the band stuck, Fleetwood regularly played his drum pack outside the studio's parcel screen to all the more likely measure Caillat's and Dashut's responses to the music's section. Puzzles were put around the drums and around John McVie, who played his low pitch guitar confronting Fleetwood. Buckingham performed near the beat area, while Christine McVie's consoles were avoided the drum pack. Caillat and Dashut went through around nine days working with a scope of receivers and speakers to get a bigger sound, before finding they could modify the sound adequately on the API blending console. 

As the studio sessions advanced, the band individuals' new private connections that shaped after different partitions began to negatively affect Fleetwood Mac. The performers did not meet or associate after their day by day work at the Record Plant. At the time, the flower child development still influenced Sausalito's way of life and medications were promptly accessible. Open-finished spending plans empowered the band and the designers to wind up liberal; restless evenings and the broad utilization of cocaine stamped a significant part of the collection's creation. Chris Stone, one of the Record Plant's proprietors, showed in 1997 that Fleetwood Mac brought "overabundance at its most unreasonable" by assuming control over the studio for long and incredibly costly sessions; he expressed, "The band would come in at 7Â atÂ night, have a major dining experience, party tillÂ 1Â orÂ 2 toward the beginning of the day, and after that when they were so whacked-out they couldn't do anything, they'd begin recording". 

Scratches has recommended that Fleetwood Mac made the best music when in the most exceedingly awful shape, while, as indicated by Buckingham, the strains between band individuals educated the account procedure and prompted "the entire being more than the entirety of the parts". The couple's work progressed toward becoming "self-contradicting" after their last split, in spite of the fact that Buckingham still had an expertise for taking Nicks' tracks and "making them lovely". The vocal harmonies between the couple and Christine McVie functioned admirably and were caught utilizing the best amplifiers accessible. Scratches' melodious center permitted the instrumentals in the tunes that she wrote to be looser and increasingly conceptual. As per Dashut, every one of the chronicles caught "feeling and feeling without a center manÂ ... or on the other hand treating". John McVie would in general conflict with Buckingham about the make-up of tunes, however both confess to accomplishing great results. Christine McVie's "Warbler", which Caillat felt required a show lobby's climate, was recorded amid a throughout the night session at Zellerbach Auditorium, crosswise over San Francisco Bay in Berkeley. 

Following more than two months in Sausalito, Fleetwood organized a ten-day visit to offer the band a reprieve and fan input. After the shows, recording continued at settings in Los Angeles, including Wally Heider Studios. Christine McVie and Nicks did not go to a large portion of the sessions and went on vacation until they were expected to record any outstanding vocals. The remainder of Fleetwood Mac, with Caillat and Dashut, attempted to finish the overdubbing and blending of "Bits of gossip" after the Sausalito tapes were harmed by rehashed use amid chronicle; the kick and catch drum sound tracks sounded "dead". A rat harvest time voyage through the US was dropped to permit the finish of the collection, whose planned discharge date of September 1976 was pushed back. A master was enlisted to redress the Sausalito tapes utilizing a vari-speed oscillator. Through a couple of earphones which played the harmed tapes in his left ear and the security ace accounts in his right, he merged their particular velocities helped by the timings given by the catch and hello there cap sound tracks. Fleetwood Mac and their co-makers needed a "no-filler" last item, in which each track appeared a potential single. After the last acing stage and hearing the melodies consecutive, the band individuals detected they had recorded something "quite ground-breaking". 

In fall 1976, while as yet recording, Fleetwood Mac displayed tracks from "Bits of gossip" at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles.
