In that capacity, she was depicted in 2001 as "the most huge lady in the historical backdrop of the Air Force". Framed as a part of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in March 1941, the WAAAF was the first and biggest formally dressed ladies' administration in Australia amid World WarÂ II, numbering in excess of 18,000 individuals by late 1944 and making up more than 30% of RAAF ground staff. 

Conceived and taught in Victoria, Stevenson was an official with the Berlei organization when she was delegated Director WAAAF. At first positioned squadron officer, she rose to move toward becoming gathering officer by April 1942. Stevenson continued her non military personnel vocation following her release from the Air Force in 1946.

Stevenson was delegated a Member of the Order of the British Empire and a Member of the Order of Australia for her administrations to the network and to female veterans. 

Conceived on 18 July 1903 in Wangaratta, Victoria, Clare Grant Stevenson was the fifth of six offspring of Robert Logan Grant Stevenson and his significant other Ada Pollie, nÃ©e Griffiths. At the point when Clare was four her family moved to Essendon, where she went to Winstow Girls' Grammar School and Essendon High School, finishing her middle of the road and leaving testaments. In 1922, she entered the Faculty of Science at the University of Melbourne, yet changed to training subsequent to coming up short science in her last year. Stevenson was a hockey blue and was dynamic in a few grounds gatherings, including the Students' Representative Council and the Science Club. She progressed toward becoming President of the Committee of Melbourne University Women, and graduated in 1925 with a Diploma of Education. 

Stevenson started her working vocation with the YWCA in 1926. A solid backer for proceeding with instruction, amid her initial two years with the affiliation she composed night classes for laborers in Sydney. She filled in as General Secretary of the Rockhampton, Queensland, part of the YWCA from 1929 to 1931. In 1932 she took up a situation as a preparation and research officer at Berlei, and from 1935 to 1939 spoke to the organization in London as a senior official. Stevenson had come back to Australia and was situated in Sydney, managing Berlei's item inquire about and the preparation of offers staff, at the flare-up of World WarÂ II. 

Late in 1940, Stevenson was selected to be the principal Director of the arranged Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF). Albeit quick to help the war exertion in some limit, she rejected inferable from the regulatory and social impediments she anticipated in the job; her arrangement proceeded notwithstanding on 21 May 1941. The Air Member for Personnel, Air Vice Marshal Henry Wrigley, had chosen Stevenson based on her administration foundation, scholastic capabilities and information of ladies' associations, and in light of the fact that she was not a "socialite". In spite of her doubts, Stevenson felt she had no real option except to acknowledge the arrangement, which produced results on 9 June. 

Set up on 25 March 1941 in light of campaigning by ladies needing to serve in the war, and to free progressively male ground group for abroad postings, the WAAAF was the main formally dressed ladies' part of an equipped administration in Australia, originating before comparable associations in the Army and Navy. Less than two hundred staff had been enlisted when Stevenson moved toward becoming Director in June; this number would develop to around a thousand before the year's over. For the initial three months of its reality the WAAAF had been under the brief order of Flight Officer Mary Bell, spouse of a RAAF assemble commander and previous Australian Commandant of the Women's Air Training Corps, an association of female pilots and ground staff that had been framed in 1939 and had been giving intentional help to the Air Force. Ringer surrendered on learning of Stevenson's arrangement, as opposed to remain on as Deputy Director and report to somebody from outside the administration clique; she later rejoined at Wrigley's solicitation, depending on the prerequisite that she would get no advancement higher than flight officer. 

In her job as Director, Stevenson was in charge of preparing, resolve and welfare of all WAAAF staff. Thoughtfully dedicated to parallel open door paying little heed to sexual orientation and social foundation, from the start she needed to manage segregation by government experts, a large number of whom had been against the making of such an administration. The Minister for Defense, Harold Thorby, pronounced that "flight removes ladies from their regular habitat, the home and the preparation of the family", and a few senior Air Force officers, including the man later known as the "Father of the RAAF", Air Marshal Richard Williams, and the Director of Personnel Services, Group Captain Joe Hewitt, likewise battled the proposition. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, a Royal Air Force authority who acknowledged how the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) had substantiated itself amid the Battle of Britain in 1940, bolstered its foundation yet lost some enthusiasm after his favored decision as Director, his little girl Sybil-Jean, a serving WAAF officer, was precluded. The Federal government announced that WAAAF staff would be paid 66% of what a male doing the identical exchange got. They could be discretionarily expelled for disciplinary offenses without plan of action to a court-military, could just enter RAAF messes by welcome, and could hope to be saluted as an affability, not manage in doubt. Creator Joyce Thomson fights that such conditions made the ladies "formally dressed regular people". Ladies were at first selected for inexhaustible year time spans as opposed to enrolled as changeless staff; just in 1943 did the WAAAF become some portion of the Permanent Air Force. 

Stevenson thought about lodging, regalia, and enroll preparing to be her first needs in the wake of taking up her arrangement. On touching base at No.Â 1 WAAAF Depot in Malvern, Victoria, she was "broke at the jail like air of the spot". She drew on her retail experience to sort out the WAAAF and to plan its uniform. Stevenson was elevated to wing officer on 1 October 1941, and amass officer on 1 April 1942, which was to be the most astounding position achieved by a serving WAAAF part. She took a functioning enthusiasm for enlistment, her liberal social viewpoint manifested by her assurance that solitary ladies with youngsters ought not be banned from passage to the WAAAF. To build up exclusive requirements, Stevenson by and by talked with all WAAAF officer students and informed whatever number of them as could be allowed before they were presented on another activity. She was cited in the Adelaide "Promoter" as saying, "While talking with candidates, I generally call attention to the hardships of the administration, so nobody will come in on a surge of energy and think twice about it later." Stevenson likewise attempted to keep up the spirit of work force, urging officers to go to gather initiative courses and compose relaxation and wearing exercises for their staff. Colonel Sybil Irving, the leader of the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS), who watched direct the WAAAF's preparation strategies before extensive scale AWAS enrollment started, later pronounced that Stevenson "did the most appropriate spearheading work" in picking up acknowledgment for ladies in the military. As far as it matters for her, Stevenson considered the job of Director "a troublesome activity and regularly a forlorn one". 

Right off the bat in 1943 a strategy change was mooted to expel female officers from the specialized musterings they had so far filled in the WAAAF, and substitute male officers in these jobs. In restricting this, Stevenson circumvented the new Air Member for Personnel, Air Commodore Frank Lukis, and composed straightforwardly to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore John McCauley. She told McCauley, "I battle that it is a misuse of cash and preparing to take ladies figure officers, ladies from Signals (S4) and casualtyÂ ... when they have took in their work and substitute these ladies by men who need to become familiar with the activity", and suggested that he direct the Air Member for Personnel to guarantee that female officers kept on being utilized in specialized positions, and not just for organization and welfare. McCauley concurred with Stevenson however Lukis spoke to Air Vice Marshal George Jones, the Chief of the Air Staff. Jones supported Lukis' power, and the last sent what Joyce Thomson depicted as a "stinging reproach" to Stevenson, who was compelled to apologize. In any occasion, ladies officers kept on being utilized in specialized positions as the WAAAF extended throughout the following two years, cresting in quality at 18,667 individuals in October 1944. Starting at July that year, ladies contained thirty-one percent of Air Force ground staff and filled sixty-one exchanges, all recently involved by men. Before the finish of the war around 27,000 ladies had served in the WAAAF. 

In a July 1945 act evaluation, Joe Hewitt, presently an air commodore and the Air Member for Personnel, composed that Stevenson had "showed extraordinary astuteness in the execution of her obligations and significant genius in the arrangement of troublesome issues". She kept on driving the WAAAF following the suspension of threats, resigning on therapeutic grounds on 22Â March 1946. Enduring diminished muscle work in her left arm and agony on the left half of her face and neck, she was determined to have brachial neuritis, followed to typhus, lockjaw and smallpox infusions got the past May in anticipation of a proposed visit to Manila that never eventuated. In her last yearly location to the WAAAF as its Director, Stevenson urged its individuals to utilize their administration experience when they came back to non military personnel life: 

To "The Sydney Morning Herald", she battled: 

Given a jeweled pin as a goodbye blessing by her individual officers, Stevenson asked that its incentive rather be put towards a grant for an ex-WAAAF part to examine social work at the University of Sydney. The WAAAF itself, the first and biggest of Australia's wartime ladies' administrations, was disbanded on 30Â September 1946. It was prevailing in 1950 by another association with a different sanction to the RAAF, the Women's Royal Australian Air Force (WRAAF). WRAAF individuals accomplished a compensation scale equivalent to the male administration in 1972, and after five years were coordinated with the RAAF. 

Following her release from the WAAAF, Stevenson continued her profession as a senior official with Berlei, and stayed with the organization until her retirement in 1960. Parallel to her work at Berlei, she was a trustee of the Services Canteens Trust Fund in Melbourne, keeping up her connections with the association for the following forty years. The reserve regulated surplus monies from wartime administration flasks for the groups of previous officers. Stevenson acquired a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of Melbourne in 1948. An establishing benefactor of the Council of Ex-Servicewomen's Associations, she was designated a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1960 Queen's Birthday Honors for her welfare take a shot at sake of female veterans. She helped set up the Scholarship Trust Fund for Civilian Widows' Children in 1963, and was an exploration officer with the New South Wales Council on the Aging (COTA) from 1969 to 1978. In 1975, Stevenson was associated with building up the Kings Cross Community Aid and Information Service, serving for a period as President and as an individual from the Management Committee until 1987. 

Stevenson established the Carers Association of New South Wales, and turned into its first President, in 1980. While presenting with COTA in 1974, she had arranged a report titled "Commitment" concerning the dimensions of help given to the older by their family and companions. This prompted her shaping in 1976 a subcommittee of COTA made up of carers, from which she later made the Carers Association as an autonomous association. As President of the affiliation, Stevenson campaigned for the foundation of a Carers Pension in New South Wales, which was enacted in 1985. She is honored at the Carers Association (presently Carers NSW) by the Clare Stevenson Memorial Lectures. 

In 1981, to remember the fortieth commemoration of the arrangement of ladies' administrations in World WarÂ II, Stevenson was approached to lead the female unforeseen in the Anzac Day march in Sydney. She distributed "The WAAAF Book", a gathering of memories by previous individuals from the administration, with Honor Darling in 1984.
