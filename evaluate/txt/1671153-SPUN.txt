"Undertaking" essayist Mike Sussman told TrekNation in May 2005 that Braga had considered the possibility of a scene hybrid highlighting characters from other "Star Trek" arrangement before the finale. Sussman's unique thought for the scene was to have of "" treating an evil patient who could possibly have been Archer caught later on. Because of the topic, Sussman said his variant would not have been appropriate for the last scene. In meetings, Berman said that the scene had dependably been expected as the season finale paying little heed to scratch-off, and gave clashing answers with respect to whether Trip would in any case have been slaughtered if the show was to proceed. 

Allan Kroeker coordinated the scene, his third arrangement finale following ""s "What You Leave Behind" and ""s "". "These Are the Voyages..." included visitor appearances by Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis as their "People to come" characters William Riker and Deanna Troi. Brent Spiner, another "People to come" veteran who had visitor featured before in the fourth period of "Big business", had an off-screen talking job as the android Data. Jeffrey Combs showed up as the Andorian Shran, whom Coto had needed to be a changeless expansion to the cast in case of another season. 

Shooting of the last scene started on Friday, February 25, after the main portion of the day was spent finishing "Land Prime". Central photography took eight days to finish, one day longer than expected. The cold complex arrangement of Rigel X, first found in the pilot scene, was utilized, just like the once in a while observed "Enterprise"s cookroom. "Venture"- D areas, for example, passages and the perception relax were re-made. Frakes and Sirtis touched base at the parcel while a "Spare Enterprise" rally was being held outside the entryways. Like "What You Leave Behind", a large number of the creation staff cameoed for a vast group scene toward the finish of the scene, as Archer gets ready to give his discourse. Fifteen "VIPs" including journalists Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, AndrÃ© Bormanis, and Manny Coto joined two dozen additional items in framing some portion of the group of onlookers. The remainder of the advanced set was filled by a PC created swarm. After their parts were done, the last expulsion of each cast part was met with commendation.

Recording finished on Tuesday, March 8, and the sets were struck. Frakes and Sirtis returned on March 9 to finish green screen shots, which would be utilized when their characters entered or left the holodeck. Prior to the scene's discharge, Berman would not expand on the last scene's substance, saying "It will make them shock wanders aimlessly. It's fairly a valentine." 

"These Are the Voyages..." was contrarily gotten by the two faultfinders and the show's cast. Before the scene broadcast, Blalock called the scene "horrifying." She followed up her comments by saying she was furious about the finale being a "The Next Generation" scene instead of an end for "Big business". 

Connor Trinneer (who played Commander Trip Tucker), felt that the finale ought to have had a significant goodbye that he portrayed as a ""M*A*S*H" minute", yet that the makers did not have any desire to concentrate on such a component. Anthony Montgomery (who played Ensign Travis Mayweather) was also disappointed with the finale and stated, "I feel there could have been an increasingly viable approach to wrap things up for our show just as the establishment all in all. It just appeared to remove a smidgen from what the "Endeavor" cast and group worked so tenaciously to accomplish in the course of recent years." While Frakes delighted in working with Sirtis once more, he said that "actually it was somewhat of a stretch to have us closed down [the "Undertaking" cast's] appear," and that looking back it was a damage to them. The early analysis constrained the show's makers to hold a meeting and address the issue. Braga conceded there was cast distress, however shielded the scene as an approach to close "Endeavor" yet "Star Trek" in general. 

Commentators were additionally incredulous of the "People to come" tie-in. "Science fiction Weekly's" Patrick Lee said the surrounding story "lessens [the "Venture" cast] to the status of guinea pigs." Lee further noticed that even without the visitor appearances, the scene did not satisfy the best contributions of the period, including "In a Mirror, Darkly".

The passing of Tucker was another object of debate. Salem depicted the improvement as "a noteworthy character is senselessly slaughtered off in administration of an inconsequential plot gadget," a grievance resounded by IGN. On-screen character Connor Trinneer, who played Trip, said amid a tradition appearance that the character had "escaped much more terrible scratches than that," and the demise appeared to be constrained.

A few commentators finished their surveys by saying that whether fans would be disillusioned or satisfied by the scene, most of easygoing watchers would not mind somehow. 

Because of a portion of these reactions, Coto expressed that he by and by considered the two-section story "" and "Land Prime" that went before "These Are the Voyages..." the real finale of the "Endeavor" storyline. Berman said "I've perused a great deal of the reactions and I see how a few people feel, yet [Braga] and I invested a ton of energy thinking of the thought and a to some degree, I would state, remarkable completion of an arrangement, particularly when you're finishing it rashly. [...] You never prefer to baffle individuals, however I believe it's jabber to state that it was more a "People to come" scene than a "Venture" scene. The main components of ["The Next Generation"] that were available were there as a sounding board to enable us to take a gander at a mission that occurred six years after "Land Prime"." 

In 2009, Den of Geek, while recognizing cast studies of the finale, expressed that "These Are the Voyages...'" was the tenth best scene of the arrangement, applauding the consideration of Riker and Troi and commenting the "irrefutable bliss in observing the commonplace and darling characters back on screen."

In the fourth season, Manny Coto wound up official maker in the wake of composing and co-delivering the show since 2003. While Coto's scenes were hailed by faultfinders and fans as rising to the nature of past "Star Trek" TV arrangement, the normal viewership dropped to 2.9 million, with an arrangement low appearing 2.5 million in January 2005.

Brannon Braga proposed that the explanation behind the wiping out was watcher weariness, taking note of that "following 18 years and 624 hours of "Star Trek", the group of onlookers started to have a tad of needless excess." Fans, in the mean time, scrutinized Berman and Braga for overlooking "Star Trek" ordinance and declining to fix their shows. Michael Hinman, news facilitator for SyFy Portal, expressed that notwithstanding the oversaturation of "Star Trek", there "additionally is an oversaturation of Braga and Berman. [...] They couldn't kick back and state, 'You know, we can't keep this new.' No, it was increasingly about their inept consciences, and their irrational 'Regardless of whether it's penniless, don't fix it' frame of mind." Braga guarded the arrangement, taking note of that "The Next Generation" confronted little challenge from other sci-fi appears, while "Undertaking" needed to fight with a plenty of shows, for example, "Battlestar Galactica".

Melanie McFarland of the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer", in the interim, said the show "never found the feeling of uniqueness inside the "Trek" universe that each variant that preceded it had." Despite the crossing out, Paramount stayed hopeful. Studio head David Stapf looked "forward to another part of this suffering establishment later on." Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendrensen built up an idea for another film occurring after "Big business" however before the 1960s TV program.
