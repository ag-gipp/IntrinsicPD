To give resistance against low-flying German air ship amid the assault, a gathering of 24 men, including Peeler, from the third Pioneer Battalion's automatic rifle segment were connected to the tenth Brigade's 37th Battalion. 

The assault on Broodseinde started at 06:00 under the front of a gunnery torrent. Outfitted with a Lewis Gun, Peeler progressed with the underlying wave. The Australians quickly crossed the first before getting to be bound by a gathering of nine German fighters, who were arranged in a shellhole and killing at the propelling troops.

After just shy of about a month adrift, the troopship landed at Port Tewfik in Suez, where the contingent entrained for Palestine.

On 8 March, the Dutch surrendered, requesting all men to set out their arms. With provisions running low and unfit to contact the Australian Government, Brigadier Blackburn declared the surrender of Blackforce four days after the fact.
