The couple met while Bazy was running the "Times-Herald", yet Robert McCormick, Bazy's uncle and proprietor of the paper, considered Garvin Tankersley to be of inadmissible economic wellbeing for Bazy in light of the fact that "Tank" was from a poor Lynchburg, Virginia, family. McCormick likewise opposed her separation. Bazy saw the last position as two-faced, given McCormick's very own confounded individual life. McCormick's endeavors to end the relationship at last incited the couple to abscond, and the Tankersleys were hitched for a long time until Garvin's demise in 1997. 

Tankersley likewise fiddled with battle governmental issues. In 1948 she sorted out "Twenties for Taft" clubs to help the 1948 Presidential battle of Robert A. Taft.

She picked up experience running a paper in 1946 when she and Peter Miller bought the "LaSalle Post-Tribune" in LaSalle, Illinois, and the "Peru News-Herald", in Peru, Illinois, blending the papers to make the "Day by day News-Tribune." In 1949, her uncle, "Colonel" Robert R. McCormick, delegated her as the distributer of the family-claimed "Washington Times-Herald", a "noninterventionist and archconservative" paper known for melodrama. McCormick had acquired it following the 1948 passing of Eleanor Medill "Cissy" Patterson, his first cousin, and needed Bazy to utilize the paper to make "a station of American standards".

Tankersley was 28 at the time and was given the title of Vice-President. 

Amid Tankersley's residency as distributer of the "Times-Herald", the paper was entangled in two discussions identified with McCarthy, one including assaults proposed to help unseat Democratic Senator Millard E. Tydings in 1950, and the other a claim brought by Drew Pearson in 1951 over what Pearson saw as a "connivance to spread his notoriety". In the Tydings case, a composite photo made by Garvin Tankersley made Tydings have all the earmarks of being meeting with a socialist gathering pioneer and was a factor in Tydings losing his race. It likewise conveyed Bazy and her paper to the consideration of the United States Senate, where the paper's treatment of Tydings was seen by a bipartisan Senate board as an infringement of "straightforward conventionality and genuineness" and "a stunning maltreatment of the soul and purpose of the First Amendment of the Constitution". The claim was a $5.1 million reason recorded by Pearson against different respondents, including McCarthy and the "Times-Herald", Westbrook Pegler and Fulton Lewis, charging they had "contrivedÂ ... to hold offended party up to open contempt and derision". Pearson every now and again scrutinized McCarthy, McCarthy condemned Pearson in a discourse on the floor of the Senate, and the two men had even been in a physical squabble in December 1950. The "Times-Herald" ran articles condemning of Pearson and in one case depicted Pearson as "Another Deal socialist", however it was affirmed to have been a typographical blunder that ought to have perused "writer". 

Bazy (at that point Miller) was distributer of the paper for just 19 months. By April 1951, McCormick and his niece created contrasts of suppositions over both the paper and her association with Garvin Tankersley. She later stated, "I comprehended when I went to the "Times-Herald" I was to have full control. That control was not given meÂ ... There is some distinction in our political convictions. I have more extensive Republican perspectives than [McCormick] has. I am for indistinguishable individuals from the colonel, yet I am for some more individuals." McCormick likewise advised her to settle on Garvin Tankersley and the Tribune Company. Thus, she left the "Times-Herald". McCormick endeavored to run the paper himself, however lost cash on the endeavor, and sold the "Times-Herald" to "The Washington Post" in 1954. When he reported the deal, one of the paper's board individuals demanded that Bazy Tankersley be allowed to buy it, so McCormick allowed her 48 hours to coordinate the $10 million asking cost. She couldn't collect the cash to do as such. Upon the buy of the "Times-Herald", the "Post" solidified its market position by suspending the adversary paper. In spite of the fact that antagonized for a long time, Bazy and McCormick accommodated before his passing. 

After the deal, she kept on composing a paper segment for the "Post", yet in addition started to raise Arabian steeds as a full-time occupation.

From that point, she came back to Tucson for all time.

This whole line offers ascend to Miller's declaration that the Al-Marah crowd is the "most seasoned persistently reproduced, exclusive band of Arabians on the planet".
