William Sterndale Bennett 

Sir William Sterndale Bennett (13 April 18161 February 1875) was an English arranger, piano player, conductor and music instructor. At ten years old Bennett was admitted to the London Royal Academy of Music (RAM), where he stayed for a long time. By the age of twenty, he had started to make a notoriety for being a professional piano player, and his sytheses got high recognition. Among those awed by Bennett was the German arranger Felix Mendelssohn, who welcomed him to Leipzig. There Bennett turned out to be neighborly with Robert Schumann, who shared Mendelssohn's adoration for his sytheses. Bennett burned through three winters creating and performing in Leipzig. 

In 1837 Bennett started to educate at the RAM, with which he was related for the majority of a mind-blowing remainder. For a long time he educated there, later likewise instructing at Queen's College, London. Among his understudies amid this period were Arthur Sullivan, Hubert Parry, and Tobias Matthay. All through the 1850s he created nearly nothing, in spite of the fact that he executed as a musician and coordinated the Philharmonic Society for a long time. He likewise effectively advanced shows of orchestral compositions. From 1848 onwards his vocation was punctuated by enmity among himself and the conductor Michael Costa. 

In 1858 Bennett came back to sythesis, however his later works, however well known, were viewed as antiquated and did not stimulate as much basic excitement as his young structures had done. He was Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge from 1856 until 1875. In 1866 he moved toward becoming Principal of the RAM, safeguarding it from conclusion, and stayed in this situation until his demise. He was knighted in 1871. He kicked the bucket in London in 1875 and was covered in Westminster Abbey. 

Bennett impacted English music, not exclusively as an arranger but rather likewise as an educator, as an advertiser of benchmarks of melodic training and as a critical figure in London show life. As of late, energy about Bennett's creations has been revived and some of his works, including an orchestra, his piano concerti, some vocal music and a large number of his piano pieces, have been recorded. In his bicentenary year of 2016, a few shows of his music and other related occasions occurred. 

Bennett was conceived in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third kid and just child of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield area church, and his significant other Elizabeth, "nÃ©e" Donn. Notwithstanding his obligations as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, writer and piano educator; he named his child after his companion William Sterndale, a portion of whose sonnets the senior Bennett had set to music. His mom kicked the bucket in 1818, matured 27, and his dad, subsequent to remarrying, passed on in 1819. In this manner stranded at three years old, Bennett was raised in Cambridge by his fatherly granddad, John Bennett, from whom he got his first melodic instruction. John Bennett was an expert bass, who sang as a lay representative in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity universities. The youthful Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he stayed for a long time. In 1826, at ten years old, he was acknowledged into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been established in 1822. The analysts were so inspired by the kid's ability that they postponed all expenses for his educational cost and board. 

Bennett was an understudy at the RAM for the following ten years. At his granddad's desire his important instrumental examinations were at first as a musician, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He likewise contemplated the piano under W. H. Holmes, and following five years, with his granddad's understanding, he accepting the piano as his foremost investigation. He was a modest youth and was constrained about his aptitude in structure, which he considered under the foremost of the RAM, William Crotch, and after that under Cipriani Potter, who took over as central in 1832. Among the companions Bennett made at the Academy was the future music pundit J. W. Davison. Bennett did not think about singing, however when the RAM mounted an understudy creation of "The Marriage of Figaro" in 1830, Bennett, matured fourteen, was thrown in the mezzo-soprano job of the page kid Cherubino (normally played by a lady "en travesti"). This was among the couple of disappointments of his profession at the RAM. "The Observer" wryly remarked, "of the page... we won't talk", however recognized that Bennett sang pleasingly and as per the general inclination of the gathering of people. "The Harmonicon", be that as it may, called his execution "all around a smudge on the piece". 

Among Bennett's understudy arrangements were a piano concerto (No. 1 in D minor, Op. 1), an orchestra and a suggestion to "The Tempest". The concerto got its open debut at a symphonic show in Cambridge on 28 November 1832, with Bennett as soloist. Exhibitions before long followed in London and, by regal direction, at Windsor Castle, where Bennett played in April 1833 for King William IV and Queen Adelaide. The RAM distributed the concerto at its very own cost as a tribute. A further London act was given in June 1833. The commentator of "The Harmonicon" composed of this show: 

[T]he most total and satisfying execution was that of youthful Bennett, whose creation would have presented respect on any settled ace, and his execution of it was truly astounding, not simply for its accuracy and brilliancy, yet for the inclination he showed, which, in the event that he continue as he has started, should in a couple of years place him high in his calling. 

In the group of onlookers was Felix Mendelssohn, who was adequately inspired to welcome Bennett to the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in DÃ¼sseldorf. Bennett asked, "May I come to be your student?" Mendelssohn answered, "No, no. You should come to be my companion". 

In 1834 Bennett was delegated organist of St Ann's, Wandsworth, London, a house of prayer of simplicity to Wandsworth ward church. He held the post for a year, after which he showed private understudies in focal London and at schools in Edmonton and Hendon. In spite of the fact that by normal assent the RAM had minimal more to show him after his seventh or eighth year, he was allowed to stay as a free guest there until 1836, which fit him well, as his salary was little. In May 1835 Bennett showed up at the Philharmonic Society of London, playing the debut of his Second Piano Concerto (in E-level major, Op. 4), and in the next year he gave there the debut of his Third Concerto (in C minor, Op. 9). Bennett was likewise an individual from the Society of British Musicians, established in 1834 to advance explicitly British performers and structures. Davison wrote in 1834 that Bennett's suggestion named for Lord Byron's "Parisina" was "the best thing that has been played at the Society's shows". 

In May 1836 Bennett made a trip to DÃ¼sseldorf in the organization of Davison to go to the Lower Rhenish Music Festival for the main execution of Mendelssohn's oratorio "St Paul". Bennett's visit was empowered by a sponsorship by the piano-production firm of John Broadwood and Sons. Enlivened by his adventure up the Rhine, Bennett started chip away at his suggestion "The Naiads" (Op. 15). After Bennett left for home, Mendelssohn kept in touch with their shared companion, the English organist and author Thomas Attwood, "I think him the most encouraging youthful artist I know, in your nation as well as here, and I am persuaded on the off chance that he doesn't turn into an incredible artist, it isn't God's will, yet his own". 

After Bennett's first visit to Germany there pursued three stretched out visits to work in Leipzig. He was there from October 1836 to June 1837, amid which time he made his introduction at the Gewandhaus as the soloist in his Third Piano Concerto with Mendelssohn directing. He later directed his "Naiads" suggestion. Amid this visit he likewise orchestrated the primary cricket coordinate at any point played in Germany, ("as fitting a Yorkshireman" as the musicologist Percy M. Youthful remarks). As of now Bennett wrote to Davison:[Mendelssohn] took me to his home and gave me the printed score of [his overture] 'Melusina', and a short time later we supped at the 'HÃ´tel de BaviÃ¨re', where all the melodic inner circle feedÂ ... The gathering consist[ed] of Mendelssohn, [Ferdinand] David, Stamity [sic]Â ... furthermore, a Mr. Schumann, a melodic manager, who expected to see me a "fat" man with "substantial dark stubbles." 

Bennett had been at first somewhat in wonderment of Mendelssohn, however no such convention at any point appended to Bennett's kinship with Robert Schumann, with whom he went on long nation strolls by day and visited the nearby bars by night. Each committed an expansive scale piano work to the next: in August 1837 Schumann devoted his "Symphonic Studies" to Bennett, who responded the devotion half a month later with his "Fantasie", Op. 16. Schumann was smoothly eager about Bennett's music; in 1837 he gave an exposition to Bennett in the "Neue Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Musik", adulating among different works Bennett's Op. 10 "Melodic Sketches" for piano, "three of Bennett's loveliest pictures". The exposition closes: "For quite a while he has been peering behind me, and for the second time he has asked 'Yet what are you composing?' Dear companion, I will compose close to: 'If just you knew!'" Bennett anyway had from the start a few qualms about Schumann's music, which, he told Davison in 1837, he thought "rather excessively offbeat". 

On Bennett's arrival to London he took up a showing post at the RAM which he held until 1858. Amid his second long remain in Germany, from October 1838 to March 1839, he played his Fourth Piano Concerto (Op. 19, in F minor) and the "Wood Nymphs" Overture, Op. 20. Coming back to England, he kept in touch with his Leipzig distributer Friedrich Kistner in 1840, wailing over the contrast among England and Germany (and trusting that a German would change the circumstance): You recognize what a repulsive spot England is for music; and in London I have no one who I can converse with about such things, every one of the general population are frantic with [Sigismond] Thalberg and [Johann] Strauss [I], and I have not heard a solitary Symphony or Overture in one show since last June. I earnestly trust that Prince AlbertÂ ... will accomplish something to improve our taste. 

On Bennett's third excursion, from January to March 1842, in which he additionally visited Kassel, Dresden and Berlin, he played his "Inclination" for piano and ensemble, Op. 22, in Leipzig. In spite of his then-negative perspective on music in England, Bennett botched his opportunity to build up himself in Germany. The musicologist Nicholas Temperley keeps in touch with One may figure that the early loss of the two guardians delivered in Bennett a particularly exceptional requirement for consolation and support. Britain couldn't give this to a local writer in his time. He discovered it incidentally in German melodic circles; yet, when the open door came to guarantee his earned spot as an innovator in German music, he was not exactly sufficiently strong to get a handle on it. 

Bennett came back to London in March 1842, and proceeded with his educating at the RAM. The following year the post of teacher of music at the University of Edinburgh wound up empty. With Mendelssohn's solid support Bennett connected for the position. Mendelssohn kept in touch with the main of the college, "I beseech you to utilize your ground-breaking impact for the benefit of that applicant whom I consider in each regard deserving of the spot, a genuine trimming to his craft and his nation, and in reality a standout amongst the best and most profoundly skilled artists presently living: Mr. Sterndale Bennett." Despite this backing Bennett's application was fruitless. 

Bennett had been inspired in Leipzig with the idea of orchestral arrangements shows, which had been, aside from string group of four presentations, an irregularity in London. He started in 1843 a progression of such shows including piano trios of Louis Spohr and Ludwig van Beethoven, works for piano solo, and string sonatas by Mendelssohn and others. Among those participating in these presentations were the piano virtuoso Alexander Dreyschock and FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin's understudy, the 13-year old Carl Filtsch. 

In 1844 Bennett wedded Mary Anne Wood (1824â 1862), the little girl of a maritime authority. Sythesis offered route to an interminable round of educating and melodic organization. The author and arranger Geoffrey Bush sees the marriage as denoting a break in Bennett's vocation; "from 1844 to 1856 [Bennett] was an independent educator, conductor and show coordinator; a periodic piano player a still increasingly incidental writer." Clara Schumann noticed that Bennett invested a lot of energy giving private exercises to stay aware of changing patterns in music: "His solitary possibility of adapting new music is in the carriage in transit starting with one exercise then onto the next." 

From 1842 Bennett had been an executive of the Philharmonic Society of London. He soothed the general public's hazardous funds by convincing Mendelssohn and Spohr to perform with the Society's ensemble, drawing in full houses and genuinely necessary pay. In 1842 the ensemble, under the author's mallet, gave the London debut of Mendelssohn's Third ("Scottish") Symphony, two months after its reality debut in Leipzig. In 1844 Mendelssohn directed the last six shows of the general public's season, in which among his very own works and those of numerous others he included music by Bennett. From 1846 to 1854 the Society's conductor was Michael Costa, of whom Bennett disliked; Costa was excessively given to Italian musical drama and not a factional of the German bosses, as was Bennett. Bennett kept in touch with Mendelssohn on 24 July, showing some peevishness, "The Philharmonic Directors have drawn in CostaÂ ... with which I am not great satisfied, yet I couldn't induce them despite what might be expected, and am worn out on quarreling with them. They are a more regrettable set for the current year than we have ever had." 

In May 1848, on the opening of Queen's College, London, Bennett, as one of the Founding Directors, conveyed a debut address and joined the staff, while proceeding with his work at the RAM and private educating. He composed the thirty "Preludes and Lessons", Op. 33, for his piano understudies at the school; they were distributed in 1853 and stayed in across the board use by music understudies well into the twentieth century. In a profile of Bennett distributed in 1903 F. G. Edwards noticed that Bennett's obligations as an educator seriously decreased his chance to make, in spite of the fact that he kept up his notoriety for being a soloist in yearly orchestral compositions and piano presentations at the Hanover Square Rooms, which included ambiance music and concerti by Johann Sebastian Bach and Beethoven's "A bite the dust ferne Geliebte", "at that point nearly oddities". Throughout the years he gave more than forty shows at this setting, and among the individuals who partook were the musician Henri Vieuxtemps and Heinrich Ernst, the piano players Stephen Heller, Ignaz Moscheles and Clara Schumann, and the cellist Carlo Piatti (for whom Bennett composed his Sonata Duo); arrangers spoke to includedâaside from Bennett's most loved established experts and MendelssohnâDomenico Scarlatti, Fanny Mendelssohn and Schumann. 

Just as the requests of his work as an educator and piano player, there were different elements that may have added to Bennett's long withdrawal from extensive scale organization. Charles Villiers Stanford composes that the demise of Mendelssohn in 1847 came to Bennett as "an unsalvageable misfortune". In the next year Bennett separated his up to this point close ties with the Philharmonic Society, which had exhibited a significant number of his best pieces. This break came about because of an at first minor conflict with Costa over his elucidation at the last practice of Bennett's suggestion "Parisina". The resoluteness of the two gatherings expanded this into an angry column, and started a rupture between them which was to last all through Bennett's profession. Bennett was disturbed at the Society's inability to back him up, and surrendered. 

Starting here in his life Bennett was ever progressively engaged with the weights of melodic association. In the assessment of Percy Young, he turned into "the model of the cutting edge regulatory musicianÂ ... he in the end worked for himself an invulnerable position, however in doing as such crushed his once extensive inventive ability." Bennett turned into an unfortunate casualty just as a recipient of a pattern towards professionalization in the music business in Britain; "The Principal and the Professor turned out to be amazing, while the status of the arranger and the executant (except if remote) was certainly downsized." 

In 1849 Bennett turned into the establishing leader of the Bach Society in London, whose early individuals included Sir George Smart, John Pyke Hullah, William Horsley, Potter and Davison. Under his course the Society gave the main English execution of Bach's "St Matthew Passion" on 6 April 1854. Further exhibitions of the "Enthusiasm" were given by the Society in 1858 and 1862, the last concurring with the production of Bennett's own version of the work, with an interpretation of the content into English by his understudy Helen Johnston. 

For the 1851 Great Exhibition Bennett was named a Metropolitan Local Commissioner, Musical Juror and administrator for the music at the opening Royal function. 

In June 1853 Bennett showed up as a soloist with ensemble in his own Fourth Piano Concerto. This execution was given with another association, the Orchestral Union, and pursued a censure from Costa, who had would not direct the piano player Arabella Goddard (Davison's better half) in Bennett's Third Concerto at the Philharmonic Society. Around the same time Bennett declined an encouragement to turn into the director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. He was extraordinarily enticed by the offer, yet felt it his obligation to stay in England, as the offer came past the point of no return for Bennett to make elective plans for a portion of his students, and he would not disappoint them. After the dubious 1855 period of the Philharmonic Society at which Richard Wagner directed, Bennett was chosen to assume control over the conductorship in 1856, a post which he held for a long time. At his first show, on 14 April 1856, the piano soloist in Beethoven's "Ruler" Concerto was Clara Schumann, spouse of his old companion. It was her first appearance in England. 

Bennett's stewardship of the Philharmonic Society symphony was not by any stretch of the imagination cheerful, and the student of history of the ensemble, Cyril Ehrlich, takes note of "a feeling of float and decay". Many driving individuals from the ensemble were likewise in the symphony of the Italian Opera House in London (and along these lines partisans of the dislodged Costa), and, what's more, Bennett demonstrated unfit to determine individual enmities among his driving players. Costa took to organizing plans for his artists which made practices (and now and then exhibitions) for the Society unreasonable. This gave a "feeling that [Bennett] was fit for applying just disappearing specialist among experts". In addition, contrasting London and different revolves around the mid-century, Ehrlich notes "Verdi was in Milan, Wagner in Dresden, Meyerbeer in Paris, Brahms in Vienna, and Liszt in Weimar. London had the most extravagant of groups of onlookers, and was offered Sterndale Bennett." He occasions the London debut of Schumann's "Heaven and the Peri" in the 1856 season, which, by drawing in Jenny Lind as soloist, and with Prince Albert in the gathering of people, acquired a significant membership, yet was musically tragic (and was not helped by the mayhem of a truly stuffed scene). One individual from the group of onlookers thought Lind's voice was "worn and stressed" and that there would have been "eager exhibitions of scorn had not the gathering of people been limited within the sight of Royalty". Paper faultfinders were hardly increasingly complimentary. 

Temperley expresses: "After 1855 [Bennett] was impelled by late distinctions, and periodic commissions, to make a decent number out of noteworthy and generous works, however it was past the point where it is possible to recover his initial self-assurance." Works from his later years incorporated the cello Sonata Duo for Piatti; a peaceful cantata, "The May Queen", Op. 39, for the opening of the Leeds Town Hall in 1858; an Ode (Op. 40) with words by Alfred, Lord Tennyson for the opening of the 1862 International Exhibition in London; an "Establishment Ode for Cambridge University" (Op. 41) with words by Charles Kingsley, which incorporated a regret for the late Prince Albert; an orchestra in G minor (Op. 43); a consecrated cantata,"The Woman of Samaria" for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival of 1867; lastly a second Piano Sonata ("The Maid of Orleans", Op. 46). A considerable lot of these works were made amid his mid year occasions which were spent at Eastbourne. The Ode for the Exhibition was the reason for a further imbroglio with Costa, who in spite of the fact that accountable for music for the Exhibition would not lead anything by Bennett. In the long run it was directed by Prosper Sainton, between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber additionally charged for the event. The undertaking spilled into the press, and Costa was generally censured for his conduct. 

In March 1856 Bennett, while as yet instructing at the RAM and Queen's College, was chosen Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge. He modernized the arrangement of granting music degrees, initiating "viva voce" examinations and requiring contender for doctorates to initially take the level of Bachelor of Music. After two years on 8 June 1868 the recently framed (later Royal) College of Organists granted him an Honorary Fellowship. 

In 1858 came one more conflict including Costa, when the totalitarian Earl of Westmorland, the first organizer of the RAM, decided to mastermind a membership show for the Academy to incorporate his very own Mass piece, to be led by Costa and utilizing the symphony and artists of the Opera, over the leaders of the Academy executives. Bennett left the RAM at this oppressive conduct, and was not to return until 1866. Towards the finish of 1862 Bennett's significant other kicked the bucket after a difficult disease. His biographer W. B. Squire proposes that "he never recouped from the impacts of Mrs. Bennett's passing, and that henceforward an excruciating change in him wound up evident to his companions." In 1865 Bennett again visited Leipzig where he was brought together with old companions including Ferdinand David, and his Op. 43 Symphony was performed. 

In 1866 Charles Lucas, the Principal of the RAM, reported his retirement. The position was first offered to Costa, who requested a higher compensation than the executives of the RAM could think about, and after that to Otto Goldschmidt, who was then teacher of piano at the RAM. He declined and asked the chiefs to designate Bennett. Lind, who was Goldschmidt's significant other, composed that Bennett "is absolutely the main man in England who should raise that organization from its present rot". 

Bennett was to find that heading a main music school was inconsistent with a profession as an author. The post of Principal was customarily not burdensome. He was authoritatively required to go to for just six hours every week, showing arrangement and masterminding class-records. Be that as it may, Bennett had not exclusively to run the RAM however to spare it from up and coming disintegration. The RAM had been incidentally spared from insolvency by gifts from the administration, approved by Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1864 and 1865. The next year Gladstone was out of office, and the new Chancellor, Disraeli, wouldn't reestablish the give. The executives of the RAM chose to close it, over the head of Bennett as Principal. Bennett, with the help of the staff and the understudies, expected the Chairmanship of the governing body. 

In Stanford's words, "As Chairman he succeeded, after the Government had pulled back its yearly allow, in winning it back, reestablished the money related credit of the house, and amid seven years bore the badgering tension of complex dealings with different open assemblages of incredible impact who were talking about plans for the development of national melodic training." The plans alluded to were two recommendations which would have without a doubt undermined the suitability and impact of the RAM, one to combine it in a proposed National School of Music, sponsored by the Royal Society of Arts under Henry Cole, the other to migrate it (without security of residency) in the premises of the Royal Albert Hall. 

The RAM in 1866 was fit as a fiddle as far as impact and notoriety just as monetarily. The faultfinder Henry Chorley distributed information in that year appearing just 17 percent of symphonic players in Britain had contemplated there. No graduated class of the RAM were individuals from the ensemble at Covent Garden musical drama house. Chorley included, "I can't recollect one incredible instrumental player the Academy has turned out amid the most recent 25 years." Bennett himself was not by any stretch of the imagination as per the accentuation Chorley put on instrumental preparing for the RAM; he was concerned (and with reason) that such a strategy could mean supply oustripping interest for alumni. Bennett himself showed piece at the RAM; this was without a doubt where his most prominent interests lay at this period, and it creates the impression that the precedents he provided for his students focused alone 'preservationist' top picks of Mendelssohn, Beethoven and Mozart. In any case, the notoriety and prevalence of the RAM expanded uniquely under his stewardship. The quantity of students, which had dropped calamitously when the executives had proposed shutting the foundation, climbed relentlessly. Toward the finish of 1868 there had been 66 understudies. By 1870 the number was 121, and by 1872 it was 176. 

Bennett got privileged degrees from the colleges of Cambridge (1867) and Oxford (1870). The Philharmonic Society granted him its Beethoven gold decoration in 1867. In 1871 he was knighted by Queen Victoria (two years after his old adversary Costa had been agreed a similar respect), and in 1872 he got an open tribute before an extensive gathering of people at St James' Hall, London. The cash bought in at this occasion established a grant and prize at the RAM, which is still granted. An English Heritage blue plaque has been set at the house in 38 Queensborough Terrace, London, where Bennett lived amid a considerable lot of his later years. 

Bennett passed on matured 58 on 1 February 1875 at his home in St John's Wood, London. As per his child the reason was "infection of the mind"; unfit to rise one morning, he had fallen into a decay and passed on inside seven days. He was covered on 6 February, near the tomb of Henry Purcell, in Westminster Abbey. The a cappella group of four, "God is a Spirit", from his cantata "The Woman of Samaria", was sung to go with the obsequies. The principal show of the Philharmonic Society's season, on 18 March, started with a tribute to its at some point director: pieces from his incomplete music for Sophocles' disaster "Ajax", and the total "The Woman of Samaria", for which the choir was given by the RAM. These were trailed by Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto, for which the soloist was Joseph Joachim, to whom Mendelssohn had presented Bennett at Joachim's London debut in 1844. The last show of the period (5 July) incorporated an "Idyll" in memory of Bennett formed by his old partner George Alexander Macfarren. 

Bennett's child James Robert Sterndale Bennett (1847â 1928) composed a life story of his dad. A considerable lot of the author's relatives progressed toward becoming artists or entertainers, including his grandsons Robert (1880â 1963), chief of music at Uppingham School, Rutland; Tom (T.C.) (1882â 1944), writer and artist, whose little girl Joan Sterndale-Bennett (1914â 1996) was an outstanding West End performing artist; and Ernest Sterndale Bennett (1884â 1982), a theater executive in Canada. also, Charlie Simpson b.1985, of Busted and Fightstar. 

Stanford composed of Bennett: He kept up his British attributes all through his lifeÂ ...The English take a sort of pride in disguising their sentiments and feelings, and this is reflected in their society tune. The Thames has no rapids and no falls; it twists along under its woods in a delicate stream, never dry and never stopping; it is the sort of the soul of English folkmusicÂ ... Britain is as remote from Keltic flame and misery, as the Thames is from the Spey. Bennett was an ordinary example of this English trademark. He was a writer, however of the school of Wordsworth instead of Byron and Shelley. 

W. B. Squire wrote in 1885: 

Temperley recommends that, notwithstanding his veneration for Mendelssohn, Bennett accepting Mozart as his model. Geoffrey Bush concurs that "[h]is best work, similar to his piano playing, was loaded with enthusiasm none the less ground-breaking for being Mozartian (in other words, superbly controlled)", and describes him as "basically an author for the piano, an arranger of the range (not really the stature) of Chopin". 

No doubt Bennett showed and stirred more noteworthy feeling through his piano strategy than from his pieces. Stanford composes that "his playingÂ ... was without a doubt momentous and had a flame and vitality in it which does not show up on the delicate surface of his music", and notes that Bennett's exhibitions were lauded by, among others, John Field, Clara Schumann, and Ferdinand Hiller. 

Bennett's demeanors to the music of his mainland peers, beside that of Mendelssohn, were wary. Arthur Sullivan guaranteed that Bennett was "sharply biased against the new school, as he called it. He would not have a note of Schumann; and with respect to Wagner, he was outside the pale of analysis." In Bennett's 1858 address on "The visits of renowned remote artists to England", the most recent notice is of Mendelssohn, bypassing Chopin, Wagner, Verdi and Hector Berlioz, (who all just came to England after Mendelssohn's last visit); Liszt (who visited London in 1827) is excluded. In a resulting address he opined that Verdi was "vastly second rate" to Gioachino Rossini, and could just say for Berlioz that he "must be permitted the character of a fruitful and gave artistÂ ... it can't be questioned that his treatment of an extraordinary symphony is excellent in the outrageous." Of Wagner, "the legend of the alleged 'music of things to come'", Bennett noted "I have no expectation of treating him impolitely; that I altogether misconstrue him and his melodic sentiments might be my blame and not his. At any rate he has an impact right now over melodic life, which it is difficult to disregard." 

Bennett's initial time of organization was productive and incorporates those of his works which are most regarded today. When of his first visit to Germany (1836) he had effectively composed, among different works, five ensembles and three piano concerti. John Caldwell evaluates his initial melodies as "impeccably judged basically Mendelssohnian affairsÂ ... the mix and lucidness of their backups is a solid element." 

Firman composes that Bennett's best works are those for the piano: "Dismissing the shallow virtuosity of a large number of his counterparts, he built up a styleÂ ... particularly his own, basically traditional in nature, yet with reference to a variety of impacts from his very own execution repertory." The early piano works were altogether adulated by Robert Schumann, and Temperley calls attention to how Schumann himself was affected by them, with (as models) clear hints of Bennett's Op. 16 "Fantasie" (1837) (essentially a sonata) on Schumann's "Novelette", Op. 21 no. 7 (1838), and parallels between Bennett's Op. 12 Impromptus (1836) and Schumann's Op. 18 "Arabesque" (1838). 

Temperley feels that the early ensembles are the weakest works of this period, yet he proposes that "couple of piano concertos among Beethoven and Brahms are as fruitful as Bennett's in typifying the Classical soul, not in a solid edge to deck with trims of virtuosity, however in a living structure equipped for natural development, and even of auxiliary amazement." 

Bennett's style did not create after his initial years. In 1908 the musicologist W. H. Hadow surveyed his later work as pursues: "[W]hen "The May Queen" showed up [1858] the maxim of music had changed and he had not changed with it.Â ... He was too traditionalist to even think about moving with the times.Â ... [His last works] may all have been written in the forties; they are survivals of a prior strategy, not improvements but rather repetitions of a custom." Firman remarks that later well known, and increasingly shallow, pieces, for example, "Genevieve" (1839) came to dominate the more creative works of his prior period, for example, the Sonata Op. 13, and the "Rhapsody" Op. 16. 

Youthful recommends that the cantatas "The May Queen" and "The Woman of Samaria" appreciated in their prime "a prominence that was in reverse connection to their inborn legitimacy". Caldwell noticed that "The Woman of Samaria" demonstrates that "Bennett was a decent skilled worker whose just blame was a fear of the operaticÂ ... One would most likely endure the account recitative all the more promptly if the embedded developments demonstrated any sparkle of life." As respects "The May Queen", Caldwell commends the suggestion (a Mendelssohn-style work initially composed as a show piece in 1844) "however the remainder of the work is manageable stuff". He remarks that "the two works got massive longstanding notoriety and might be considered as the account model for the later Victorian mainstream and consecrated formsÂ ... fitting in with the present models of taste and decency", foreseeing such functions as Arthur Sullivan's "Kenilworth" (1864). 

Bennett altered a portion of the console works of Beethoven and Handel and co-altered the "Chorale Book for England" with Otto Goldschmidt (1863), in light of German psalms gathered by Catherine Winkworth. He administered the principal British printed release of the "St Matthew Passion". A full vocal score (with piano backup) was adjusted from the German release arranged by Adolf Bernhard Marx (Berlin 1830), which pursued Mendelssohn's recovery of the work; this was modified with reference to the score distributed by the Leipzig Bach Society in 1862. Bennett's extra beat and dynamic markings were appeared in enclosures for refinement. He gave harmonies to the figured bass both in the performance music areas (in view of the Leipzig full score) and somewhere else. Bennett likewise created releases of Bach's "The Well-Tempered Clavier" and Handel's masque "Acis and Galatea". 

Bennett addressed both at Cambridge and the London Institute; writings of his addresses were altered and distributed in 2006. At a Sheffield address in 1859 he additionally played works of the authors he examined, and "so might be viewed as the organizer of the address presentation". 

As an author Bennett was recognized in his time in both Britain and (especially in the main portion of the century) in Germany, albeit numerous British music darlings and a few driving pundits stayed hesitant to recognize the likelihood that an English writer could be of a similar stature as a German one. The Leipzig open, which had at first held that see, had been quickly changed over. Mendelssohn kept in touch with Bennett "...Â [M]y Countrymen wound up mindful that music is the equivalent in England as in Germany and all over the place, thus by your victories you have pulverized that partiality which no one would ever have decimated yet a genuine Genius." 

Bennett's child, in his account of his dad, compares as delineations English and German surveys of the suggestion "The Wood Nymphs". The London commentator William Ayrton composed: 

Schumann, conversely, composed: 

"The suggestion is beguiling; without a doubt, spare Spohr and Mendelssohn, what other living arranger is so totally ace of his pencil, or gives with it such delicacy and effortlessness of shading, as Bennett?Â ... Article measure after measure; what a firm, yet sensitive web it is from start to finish!" 

Outside these nations, Bennett remained practically obscure as a performer, despite the fact that his notoriety for being a conductor driven Berlioz to welcome him to join his "SociÃ©tÃ© Philharmonique", and the Dutch author Johannes Verhulst requested his help for the Netherlands "Society for Encouragement of Music". Davison's endeavors to intrigue the French arranger Charles Gounod in Bennett's music prompted gracious however scornful reactions. 

Sir John Betjeman, in a 1975 address, appraised Bennett as "Ruler Victoria's Senior Musical Knight". Temperley evaluates Bennett as the most recognized British writer of the early Victorian time, "the main conceivable adversaries being Samuel Sebastian Wesley (1810â 76) and Michael William Balfe (1808â 70)". 

The writer Elizabeth Sara Sheppard depicted Bennett as 'Starwood Burney' in her well known tribute of Mendelssohn, the 1853 novel "Charles Auchester". In spite of the fact that Bennett's notoriety in Germany did not quite endure the 1840s, his English students had critical effect on British music of the later nineteenth and prior twentieth century Britain. Among his students at the RAM and somewhere else were Arthur Sullivan, Joseph Parry, Alice Mary Smith, W. S. Rockstro, Hubert Parry, Tobias Matthay, Francis Edward Bache, Eaton Faning and William Cusins. Bennett's commitments to hoisting melodic preparing measures at Cambridge and the RAM were a piece of a pattern in England in the last piece of the nineteenth century whose "total effectÂ ... preceding World War I was endless", as indicated by Caldwell. 

Through his show activities at the Hanover Rooms Bennett presented an assortment of orchestral arrangements to London groups of onlookers. His title likewise altogether changed British assessment of the music of JS Bach. His "advancement of Bach was an account of tirelessness against a contemporary discernment that Bach's music wasÂ ... too hard to even think about listening to." Newspaper surveys of the chamber shows in which he incorporated the music of Bach would at first portray the music in wording, for example, "magnificence there is, yet no excellence" (1847) or "fairly antiquatedÂ ... [but] very intriguing" (1854). A critical defining moment was the participation of Prince Albert at Bennett's 1858 execution of the "St. Matthew Passion". 

Bennett left a generous music library, an expansive extent of which is possessed by his incredible extraordinary grandson Barry Sterndale Bennett (b. 1939) and is on store at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Of his aggregate of nearly 130 arrangements, about a third have been recorded for CD; among these are orchestras, suggestions, piano concerti, ambiance music, melodies and piano solo music. Amid his bicentenary year of 2016, a few shows and occasions devoted to Bennett's works were performed, including shows and courses at the RAM. From April 11 to April 15, 2016 he was highlighted as 'Arranger of the Week' on BBC Radio 3.
