The FIFA World Cup, regularly just called the World Cup, is a worldwide affiliation football rivalry challenged by the senior men's national groups of the individuals from the "" (FIFA), the game's worldwide administering body. The title has been granted at regular intervals since the debut competition in 1930, with the exception of in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held in light of the Second World War. The present victor is France, which won its second title at the 2018 competition in Russia. 

The present organization of the challenge includes a capability stage, which as of now happens over the first three years, to figure out which groups fit the bill for the competition stage, which is regularly called the "World Cup Finals". After this, 32 groups, including the consequently qualifying host nation(s), contend in the competition stage for the title at scenes inside the host nation(s) over a time of about a month. 

The 21 World Cup competitions have been won by eight national groups. Brazil have won multiple times, and they are the main group to have played in each competition. The other World Cup victors are Germany and Italy, with four titles every; Argentina, France and debut champ Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain with one title each. 

The World Cup is the most renowned affiliation football competition on the planet, just as the most generally saw and pursued game on the planet, surpassing even the Olympic Games; the aggregate viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was assessed to be 26.29Â billion with an expected 715.1Â million individuals viewing the last match, a ninth of the whole populace of the planet. 

17 nations have facilitated the World Cup. Brazil, France, Italy, Germany and Mexico have each facilitated twice, while Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, England, Argentina, Spain, the United States, Japan and South Korea (mutually), South Africa and Russia have each facilitated once. Qatar are arranged as hosts of the 2022 finals, and 2026 will be together facilitated by Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give Mexico the refinement of being the main nation to have facilitated recreations in three finals. 

The world's first worldwide football coordinate was a test coordinate played in Glasgow in 1872 among Scotland and England, which finished in a 0â 0 draw. The main worldwide competition, the debut British Home Championship, occurred in 1884. As football developed in prevalence in different pieces of the world toward the beginning of the twentieth century, it was held as a show sport without any decorations granted at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics (in any case, the IOC has retroactively updated their status to official occasions), and at the 1906 Intercalated Games. 

After FIFA was established in 1904, it endeavored to organize a global football competition between countries outside the Olympic structure in Switzerland in 1906. These were all around early days for universal football, and the official history of FIFA depicts the challenge as having been a disappointment. 

At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, football turned into an official challenge. Arranged by The Football Association (FA), England's football overseeing body, the occasion was for beginner players just and was viewed suspiciously as a show as opposed to a challenge. Incredible Britain (spoken to by the England national beginner football crew) won the gold awards. They rehashed the accomplishment at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. 

With the Olympic occasion proceeding to be challenged just between beginner groups, Sir Thomas Lipton sorted out the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy competition in Turin in 1909. The Lipton competition was a title between individual clubs (not national groups) from various countries, every last one of which spoke to a whole country. The challenge is in some cases depicted as "The First World Cup", and included the most lofty expert club sides from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, yet the FA of England would not be related with the challenge and declined the idea to send an expert group. Lipton welcomed West Auckland, a novice side from County Durham, to speak to England. West Auckland won the competition and returned in 1911 to effectively guard their title. 

In 1914, FIFA consented to perceive the Olympic competition as a "world football title for beginners", and assumed liability for dealing with the occasion. This prepared for the world's first intercontinental football rivalry, at the 1920 Summer Olympics, challenged by Egypt and 13 European groups, and won by Belgium. Uruguay won the following two Olympic football competitions in 1924 and 1928. Those were additionally the initial two open big showdowns, as 1924 was the beginning of FIFA's expert period. 

Because of the achievement of the Olympic football competitions, FIFA, with President Jules Rimet as the main thrust, again begun taking a gander at arranging its own global competition outside of the Olympics. On 28 May 1928, the FIFA Congress in Amsterdam chose to organize a big showdown itself. With Uruguay now two-time official football title holders and to commend their centennial of freedom in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host nation of the debut World Cup competition. 

The national relationship of chose countries were welcome to send a group, however the decision of Uruguay as a scene for the challenge implied a long and exorbitant excursion over the Atlantic Ocean for European sides. In reality, no European nation promised to send a group until two months before the beginning of the challenge. Rimet in the long run convinced groups from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the excursion. Altogether, 13 countries participated: seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America. 

The initial two World Cup matches occurred all the while on 13 July 1930, and were won by France and the USA, who vanquished Mexico 4â 1 and Belgium 3â 0 separately. The principal objective in World Cup history was scored by Lucien Laurent of France. In the last, Uruguay vanquished Argentina 4â 2 before 93,000 individuals in Montevideo, and turned into the principal country to win the World Cup. After the production of the World Cup, FIFA and the IOC differ over the status of novice players, thus football was dropped from the 1932 Summer Olympics. Olympic football returned at the 1936 Summer Olympics, yet was presently eclipsed by the more renowned World Cup. 

The issues confronting the early World Cup competitions were the challenges of intercontinental travel, and war. Barely any South American groups were happy to head out to Europe for the 1934 World Cup and all North and South American countries with the exception of Brazil and Cuba boycotted the 1938 competition. Brazil was the main South American group to contend in both. The 1942 and 1946 rivalries, which Germany and Brazil looked to have, were dropped because of World War II and its repercussions. 

The 1950 World Cup, held in Brazil, was the first to incorporate British members. English groups pulled back from FIFA in 1920, mostly out of reluctance to play against the nations they had been at war with, and somewhat as a challenge against remote impact on football, however rejoined in 1946 after FIFA's welcome. The competition likewise observed the arrival of 1930 heroes Uruguay, who had boycotted the past two World Cups. Uruguay won the competition again in the wake of crushing the host country Brazil, in the match called "Maracanazo" (Portuguese: "MaracanaÃ§o"). 

In the competitions somewhere in the range of 1934 and 1978, 16 groups contended in every competition, aside from in 1938, when Austria was assimilated into Germany in the wake of qualifying, leaving the competition with 15 groups, and in 1950, when India, Scotland, and Turkey pulled back, leaving the competition with 13 groups. The vast majority of the partaking countries were from Europe and South America, with a little minority from North America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. These groups were normally vanquished effectively by the European and South American groups. Until 1982, the main groups from outside Europe and South America to progress out of the first round were: USA, semi-finalists in 1930; Cuba, quarter-finalists in 1938; North Korea, quarter-finalists in 1966; and Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1970. 

The competition was extended to 24 groups in 1982, and afterward to 32 of every 1998, likewise permitting more groups from Africa, Asia and North America to partake. From that point forward, groups from these districts have delighted in more achievement, with a few having achieved the quarter-finals: Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1986; Cameroon, quarter-finalists in 1990; South Korea, completing in fourth spot in 2002; Senegal, alongside USA, both quarter-finalists in 2002; Ghana, quarter-finalists in 2010; and Costa Rica, quarter-finalists in 2014. All things considered, European and South American groups keep on commanding, e.g., the quarter-finalists in 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2018 were all from Europe or South America as were the finalists of all competitions up until this point. 

Two hundred groups entered the 2002 FIFA World Cup capability rounds; 198 countries endeavored to fit the bill for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, while a record 204 nations entered capability for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. 

In October 2013, Sepp Blatter talked about ensuring the Caribbean Football Union's locale a situation in the World Cup. In the version of 25 October 2013 of the "FIFA Weekly" Blatter composed that: "From an absolutely wearing point of view, I might want to see globalization at long last paid attention to, and the African and Asian national affiliations concurred the status they merit at the FIFA World Cup. It can't be that the European and South American confederations make a case for most of the compartments at the World Cup." Those two comments recommended to observers that Blatter could be putting himself forward for re-appointment to the FIFA Presidency. 

Following the magazine's distribution, Blatter's eventual adversary for the FIFA Presidency, UEFA President Michel Platini, reacted that he proposed to stretch out the World Cup to 40 national affiliations, expanding the quantity of members by eight. Platini said that he would assign an extra billet to UEFA, two to the Asian Football Confederation and the Confederation of African Football, two shared among CONCACAF and CONMEBOL, and an ensured spot for the Oceania Football Confederation. Platini was clear regarding why he needed to grow the World Cup. He stated: "[The World Cup is] not founded on the nature of the groups since you don't have the best 32 at the World CupÂ ... yet, it's a decent compromise.Â ... It's a political issue so why not have more Africans? The challenge is to bring every one of the general population of all the world. In the event that you don't give the likelihood to partake, they don't improve." 

In October 2016, FIFA president Gianni Infantino expressed his help for a 48-group World Cup in 2026. On 10 January 2017, FIFA affirmed the 2026 World Cup will have 48 finalist groups.

At the time, FIFA president Sepp Blatter declared he would give up his situation in February 2016. 

On 4 June 2015 Chuck Blazer while co-working with the FBI and the Swiss experts conceded that he and different individuals from FIFA's then-official board of trustees were paid off so as to advance the 1998 and 2010 World Cups. On 10 June 2015 Swiss specialists caught PC information from the workplaces of Sepp Blatter. That day, FIFA deferred the offering procedure for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in light of the claims encompassing pay off in the granting of the 2018 and 2022 competitions. At that point secretary general JÃ©rÃ´me Valcke expressed, "Because of the circumstance, I believe it's babble to begin any offering procedure for now." On 28 October 2015, Blatter and FIFA VP Michel Platini, a potential possibility for administration, were suspended for 90 days; both kept up their blamelessness in explanations made to the news media. 

On 3 December 2015 two FIFA VPs were captured on doubt of pay off in a similar Zurich lodging where seven FIFA authorities had been captured in May. An extra 16 arraignments by the U.S. Bureau of Justice were declared around the same time.

From 1930 to 1970, the "Jules Rimet Trophy" was granted to the World Cup winning group. It was initially essentially known as the "World Cup" or "Roadster du Monde", however in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the primary competition. In 1970, Brazil's third triumph in the competition qualified them for keep the trophy for all time. Be that as it may, the trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recuperated, clearly liquefied somewhere near the cheats. 

After 1970, another trophy, known as the FIFA World Cup Trophy, was structured. The specialists of FIFA, originating from seven nations, assessed the 53 exhibited models, at last settling on crafted by the Italian architect Silvio Gazzaniga. The new trophy is high, made of strong 18 carat (75%) gold and weighs . The base contains two layers of semi-valuable malachite while the base side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup victor since 1974. The depiction of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: "The lines spring out from the base, ascending in spirals, extending to get the world. From the astounding powerful pressures of the minimized body of the model ascent the figures of two competitors at the mixing snapshot of triumph." 

This new trophy isn't granted to the triumphant country for all time. World Cup champs hold the trophy just until the post-coordinate festival is done. They are granted a gold-plated copy instead of the strong gold unique promptly thereafter. 

At present, all individuals (players, mentors, and supervisors) of the main three groups get awards with a badge of the World Cup Trophy; victors' (gold), sprinters up' (silver), and third-place (bronze). In the 2002 version, fourth-place decorations were granted to has South Korea. Prior to the 1978 competition, decorations were just granted to the eleven players on the pitch toward the finish of the last and the third-place coordinate. In November 2007, FIFA reported that all individuals from World Cup-winning squads somewhere in the range of 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively granted victors' awards. 

Since the second World Cup in 1934, qualifying competitions have been held to thin the field for the last competition. They are held inside the six FIFA mainland zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, and Europe), managed by their particular confederations. For every competition, FIFA chooses the quantity of spots granted to every one of the mainland zones heretofore, for the most part dependent on the overall quality of the confederations' groups. 

The capability procedure can begin as right on time as just about three years before the last competition and last over a two-year term. The arrangements of the capability competitions vary between confederations. Generally, a couple of spots are granted to victors of intercontinental play-offs. For instance, the champ of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-put group from the Asian zone entered a play-off for a spot in the 2010 World Cup. From the 1938 World Cup onwards, have countries get programmed capability to the last competition. This privilege was likewise conceded to the shielding champions somewhere in the range of 1938 and 2002, however was pulled back from the 2006 FIFA World Cup ahead, requiring the bosses to qualify. Brazil, victors in 2002, were the principal protecting heroes to play qualifying matches. 

The present last competition has been utilized since 1998 and highlights 32 national groups contending through the span of a month in the host nation(s). There are two phases: the gathering stage pursued by the knockout stage. 

In the gathering stage, groups contend inside eight gatherings of four groups each. Eight groups are seeded, including the hosts, with the other seeded groups chosen utilizing an equation dependent on the FIFA World Rankings as well as exhibitions in late World Cups, and attracted to isolate gatherings. Different groups are doled out to various "pots", normally dependent on geological criteria, and groups in each pot are attracted aimlessly to the eight gatherings. Since 1998, imperatives have been connected to the attract to guarantee that no gathering contains in excess of two European groups or more than one group from some other confederation. 

Each gathering plays a round-robin competition, in which each group is booked for three matches against different groups in a similar gathering. This implies an aggregate of six matches are played inside a gathering. The last round of matches of each gathering is planned in the meantime to protect decency among every one of the four groups. The main two groups from each gathering development to the knockout stage. Focuses are utilized to rank the groups inside a gathering. Since 1994, three points have been granted for a success, one for a draw and none for a misfortune (previously, champs got two points). 

In the event that one thinks about every conceivable result (win, draw, misfortune) for each of the six matches in a gathering, there are 729 (= 3) result mixes conceivable. Be that as it may, 207 of these blends lead to ties between the second and third places. In such case, the positioning among these groups is resolved as pursues: 

The knockout stage is a solitary end competition in which groups play each other in erratic matches, with additional time and punishment shootouts used to choose the victor if fundamental. It starts with the round of 16 (or the second round) in which the victor of each gathering plays against the sprinter up of another gathering. This is trailed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the third-place coordinate (challenged by the losing semi-finalists), and the last. 

On 10 January 2017, FIFA affirmed another arrangement, the 48-group World Cup (to suit more groups), which comprises of 16 gatherings of three groups each, with two groups qualifying from each gathering, to frame a series of 32 knockout stage, to be actualized by 2026. 

Early World Cups were given to nations at gatherings of FIFA's congress. The areas were disputable in light of the fact that South America and Europe were by a wide margin the two focuses of solidarity in football and travel between them required three weeks by watercraft. The choice to hold the main World Cup in Uruguay, for instance, prompted just four European countries contending. The following two World Cups were both held in Europe. The choice to hold the second of these in France was debated, as the South American nations comprehended that the area would shift back and forth between the two landmasses. Both Argentina and Uruguay along these lines boycotted the 1938 FIFA World Cup. 

Since the 1958 FIFA World Cup, to maintain a strategic distance from future blacklists or discussion, FIFA started an example of rotating the hosts between the Americas and Europe, which proceeded until the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The 2002 FIFA World Cup, facilitated mutually by South Korea and Japan, was the first held in Asia, and the primary competition with numerous hosts. South Africa turned into the principal African country to have the World Cup in 2010. The 2014 FIFA World Cup was facilitated by Brazil, the principal held in South America since Argentina 1978, and was the main event where continuous World Cups were held outside Europe. 

The host nation is presently picked in a vote by FIFA's Council. This is done under a comprehensive tally framework. The national football relationship of a nation craving to have the occasion gets a "Facilitating Agreement" from FIFA, which clarifies the means and prerequisites that are normal from a solid offered. The offering affiliation additionally gets a structure, the accommodation of which speaks to the official affirmation of the office. After this, a FIFA assigned gathering of auditors visit the nation to recognize that the nation meets the necessities expected to have the occasion and a report on the nation is delivered. The choice on who will have the World Cup is typically made six or seven years ahead of time of the competition. Be that as it may, there have been events where the hosts of various future competitions were reported in the meantime, just like the case for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were granted to Russia and Qatar, with Qatar turning into the principal Middle Eastern nation to have the competition. 

For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the last competition is pivoted between confederations, permitting just nations from the picked confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to offer to have the competition. The turn approach was presented after the discussion encompassing Germany's triumph over South Africa in the vote to have the 2006 competition. In any case, the strategy of mainland turn won't proceed past 2014, so any nation, with the exception of those having a place with confederations that facilitated the two going before competitions, can apply as hosts for World Cups beginning from 2018. This is mostly to stay away from a comparative situation to the offering procedure for the 2014 competition, where Brazil was the main authority bidder. 

The 2026 FIFA World Cup was picked to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico, denoting the first run through a World Cup has been shared by three host countries. The 2026 competition will be the greatest World Cup at any point held, with 48 groups playing 80 matches. Sixty matches will happen in the US, including all matches from the quarter-finals forward, while Canada and Mexico will have 10 amusements each. 

Six of the eight bosses have won one of their titles while playing in their very own country, the special cases being Brazil, who completed as sprinters up in the wake of losing the choosing match on home soil in 1950 and lost their semi-last against Germany in 2014, and Spain, which achieved the second round on home soil in 1982. Britain (1966) won its solitary title while playing as a host country. Uruguay (1930), Italy (1934), Argentina (1978) and 

France (1998) won their first titles as host countries yet have proceeded to win once more, while Germany (1974) won their second title on home soil. 

Different countries have likewise been effective while facilitating the competition. Switzerland (quarter-finals 1954), Sweden (sprinters up in 1958), Chile (third spot in 1962), South Korea (fourth spot in 2002), and Mexico (quarter-finals in 1970 and 1986) all have their best outcomes when filling in as hosts. Up until now, South Africa (2010) has been the main host country to neglect to progress past the first round. 

The best-went to single match, appeared in the last three segments, has been the last in half of the 20 World Cups . Another match or matches drew more participation than the last in 1930, 1938, 1958, 1962, 1970â 1982, 1990 and 2006.

World Cups include official match balls uncommonly intended for every competition. Every World Cup additionally has an official tune, which have been performed by specialists running from Shakira to Will Smith. Different tunes, for example, "Nessun dorma", performed by The Three Tenors at four World Cup shows, have likewise turned out to be related to the competition. 

Framing an organization with FIFA in 1970, Panini distributed its first sticker collection for the 1970 World Cup. From that point forward, gathering and exchanging stickers has progressed toward becoming piece of the World Cup involvement, particularly for the more youthful age. FIFA has additionally authorized World Cup computer games since 1986, with Electronic Arts the present permit holder.
