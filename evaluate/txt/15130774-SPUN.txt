In December 1961, Pollard told the Secretary of the Defense Committee that he considered the Army's quality deficient to help the administration's strategy of "forward protection", which included gathering Communist hostility in South East Asia, well far from the Australian terrain. The CMF, he battled, was not legitimately prepared to give help to normal powers sent abroad, and enrollment "would seem, by all accounts, to be politically and monetarily not feasible". All things considered, the administration reintroduced induction in 1964. As the risk of South Vietnam tumbling to a Communist takeover turned out to be increasingly clear, the Army started in 1962 to practice explicitly to battle counter-uprising tasks, a kind of fighting Pollard portrayed as "baffling grabbing at a tricky foe"; he included that "no absolutely military answer for a Communist insurrection circumstance is conceivable".
