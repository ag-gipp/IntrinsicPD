The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy, named after business visionary and sportsman Thomas Lipton, was set up in 1909 and was challenged between clubs from Italy, Great Britain, Germany and Switzerland; the challenge went on for a long time. The soonest endeavor to make a container for national victor clubs of Europe was made by Swiss club FC Servette. Established in 1930, the Coupe des Nations included clubs of ten noteworthy European football associations and was considered a triumph. Because of money related reasons, the challenge was relinquished. 

The main mainland rivalry sorted out by UEFA was the European Cup in 1955. Brought about by Gabriel Hanot, the editorial manager of "L'Ã©quipe", as a challenge for victors of the European national football associations, it is viewed as the most lofty European football rivalry. At the point when the European Cup was first played, Liverpool were in the Second Division, following transfer from the First Division after the 1953â 54 season, and accordingly were ineligible for the challenge. Amid their time in the Second Division, two further rivalries were made: the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. Set up in 1955, the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was later re-marked as the UEFA Cup when it went under the sponsorship of UEFA in 1971. Since the 2009â 10 season, the challenge has been known as the UEFA Europa League. The UEFA Cup Winners' Cup was introduced in 1960 for the champs of household glass rivalries.
