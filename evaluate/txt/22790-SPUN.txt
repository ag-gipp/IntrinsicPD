At the point when not at the nearby YMCA or playing sports, Smith here and there ran with companions to the area lumberyard, springboarding off inward cylinders and doing flips into sawdust heaps (an antecedent to his well known reverse somersaults). In 1965, at age ten, he persevered through the Watts Riots with his family, reviewing that, "We needed to rest on the floor due to all the killing and plundering going on." 

While Smith was going to middle school, his folks separated.

Notwithstanding his scholastic instruction, he figured out how to change hit from Cal Poly mentor Berdy Harr. At the point when Cal Poly's beginning shortstop broke his leg halfway through the 1974 season, Smith in this way assumed control over the beginning job.

It didn't take long for Smith to procure acknowledgment in the real associations, making what some consider his most prominent handling play just ten diversions into his youngster season. The Padres played host to the Atlanta Braves on April 20, 1978, and with two out in the highest point of the fourth inning, Atlanta's Jeff Burroughs hit a ground ball up the center. Smith portrayed the play by saying, "He hit a ball back up the center that everyone thought was going into focus field. I intuitively broke to one side and bird behind second.

I hit the ground, ricocheted back up, and tossed Burroughs out at first." 

Amid an excursion to Houston, later in the season, Smith met low maintenance usherette at the Astrodome named Denise while advancing toward the group transport outside the arena. The couple built up a relationship that was some of the time long-remove in nature, and in the end chose to wed. It was likewise amid the 1978 season that Smith presented a mark move. Padres advancement chief Andy Strasberg realized Smith could perform reverse somersaults, yet that he just did them amid training before fans entered the arena. Strasberg approached Smith to complete a reverse somersault for fans amid Fan Appreciation Day on October 1, the Padres' last home round of the period. In the wake of deliberating with veteran partner Gene Tenace, Smith proceeded with the reverse somersault, and it ended up being uncontrollably prevalent. Smith completed the 1978 season with a .258 batting normal and .970 handling rate, setting second in National League Rookie of the Year casting a ballot to Bob Horner. 

Subsequent to working with a hitting educator amid the offseason, Smith neglected to record a fair hit in his initial 32 at-bats of the 1979 season. Among players with enough at-bats to fit the bill for the 1979 National League Triple Crown, Smith completed the season rearward in batting normal (.211), grand slams (0), and RBI (27). Off the field, strife created between Padres' possession and the mix of Smith and his operator, Ed Gottlieb. The gatherings went into an agreement debate before the 1980 season, and when arrangements kept going into spring preparing, the Padres recharged Smith's agreement at his 1979 compensation of $72,500 Smith's operator told the Padres the shortstop would renounce the season to race in the Tour de France, regardless of the reality Smith admitted to The Break Room on 96.5 WCMF in Rochester, New York he had never known about the Tour. Maddened by the Padres' mentality amid those agreement talks, Gottlieb took out an assistance needed promotion in the "San Diego Union", some portion of which read, "Padre baseball player needs low maintenance work to enhance pay." When Joan Kroc, spouse of Padres proprietor Ray Kroc, openly offered Smith an occupation as an associate plant specialist on her bequest, Smith and Gottlieb's association with the association disintegrated further. 

In the interim, Smith was winning acknowledgment for his achievements on the field. In 1980, he set the single-season record for most helps by a shortstop (621), and started his string of 13 continuous Gold Glove grants. Smith's handling play incited the "Yuma Daily Sun" to utilize the moniker "The Wizard of Oz" in a March 1981 component article about Smith. While "The Wizard of Oz" moniker was an implication to the 1939 movie of a similar name, Smith likewise came to be known as essentially "The Wizard" amid his playing profession, as Smith's Baseball Hall of Fame plaque would later bear witness to. In 1981, Smith made his first All-Star Game appearance as a save player. 

While Smith was having issues with the Padres' proprietors, the St. Louis Cardinals additionally gotten themselves discontent with their shortstop, Garry Templeton. Templeton's association with Cardinal Nation had turned out to be progressively stressed lastly reached a crucial stage amid an amusement at Busch Stadium on August 26, 1981, when (in the wake of being pestered for not running out a ground ball) he made revolting signals at fans, and must be physically pulled off the field by administrator Whitey Herzog. 

Given the errand of upgrading the Cardinals by proprietor Gussie Busch (and explicitly to empty Templeton), Herzog was hoping to exchange Templeton when he was drawn nearer by Padres General Manager Jack McKeon at the 1981 baseball winter gatherings. While McKeon had recently revealed to Herzog that Smith was distant in any exchange, the Padres were presently so irate at Smith's specialist Gottlieb that McKeon was eager to bargain. McKeon and Herzog concurred on a basic level to a six-player exchange, with Templeton for Smith as the highlight. It was then that Padres director Dick Williams educated Herzog that a no-exchange condition had been incorporated into Smith's 1981 contract. After learning of the exchange, Smith's underlying response was to conjure the provision and remain in San Diego, yet he was as yet intrigued to hear what the Cardinals needed to state. While the arrangement for the players close to Templeton and Smith experienced, Herzog traveled to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas occasion. Smith later reviewed that, "Whitey disclosed to me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the flag. He made me feel needed, which was an inclination I was rapidly losing from the Padres. The insignificant reality that Whitey would come such a distance out there to converse with us was all that could possibly be needed to persuade me that St. Louis was the spot I needed to be." 

On December 10, 1981, the Padres exchanged him (alongside a player to be named later and Steve Mura to the Cardinals for a player to be named later, Sixto Lezcano and Garry Templeton. The groups finished the exchange on February 19, 1982, with the Padres sending Al Olmsted to the Cardinals, with St. Louis sending Luis DeLeon to the Padres. Herzog trusted Smith could improve his hostile generation by hitting more ground balls, and in this way made an inspirational apparatus intended to enable Smith to focus on that task. Moving toward Smith one day amid spring preparing, Herzog stated, "Each time you hit a fly ball, you owe me a buck. Each time you hit a ground ball, I owe you a buck. We'll prop that up all year." Smith consented to the bet, and before the finish of the period had won near $300 from Herzog. As the 1982 season got in progress, Herzog's recently amassed group won 12 diversions in succession amid the long stretch of April, and completed the season on the National League East division. Herzog would later say of Smith's commitments that, "On the off chance that he spared two runs an amusement on safeguard, which he did numerous a night, I couldn't help suspecting that was similarly as profitable to the group as a player who drove in two runs a diversion on offense." 

Smith turned into a dad out of the blue amid the 1982 season with the introduction of his child O.J., today known as Nikko, on April 28. Smith likewise built up an enduring fellowship with partner Willie McGee amid the season, and Smith said he jumps at the chance to think he "helped Willie get over a portion of the unpleasant spots of acclimating to the real associations". Smith later took an interest in the postseason out of the blue when the Cardinals confronted the Atlanta Braves in the best-of-five 1982 National League Championship Series (NLCS). Smith drove in the arrangement's previously kept running by hitting a fielder's choice that scored McGee in Game 1, at last going five for nine in St. Louis' three-diversion arrangement clear. 

Similarly as Herzog had anticipated when he disclosed to Smith the Cardinals would win the flag with him in the group, Smith ended up as the group's beginning shortstop in the best-of-seven 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers. Amid the challenge Smith scored three runs, had five hits, and did not submit a blunder in the field. Whenever St. Louis was trailing 3â 1 with one out in the 6th inning of Game 7, Smith began a rally with a fair hit to left field, in the end scoring the first of the group's three runs that inning. The Cardinals scored two additional keeps running in the eighth inning for a 6-3 win and the title. 

After the World Series title, Smith and the Cardinals conceded to another agreement in January 1983 that paid Smith $1 million every year. Smith was casted a ballot in as the National League's beginning shortstop in the All-Star Game without precedent for 1983, and at season's end won a fourth sequential Gold Glove Award.

After Smith's partner Jack Clark hit a late-inning grand slam of his own in Game 6 to thrashing the Dodgers, the Cardinals proceeded onward to confront the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series. By and by sportswriters rushed to attract consideration regarding Smith's exceptional cautious play rather than his 2 for 23 exertion at the plate. After the Cardinals took a three-recreations to-two favorable position, a disputable Game 6 call by umpire Don Denkinger dominated the rest of the Series (which the Royals won in seven amusements). 

What was not openly known amid the customary season and playoffs was that Smith had torn his rotator sleeve subsequent to enduring an impingement in his correct shoulder amid the July 11â 14 homestand against the Padres. In the wake of enduring the impingement plunging once again into a respectable starting point on a pickoff toss, Smith adjusted his tossing movement to such an extent, that the rotator sleeve tear hence created. The 5'10" (1.78Â m), 180-pound (82Â kg) Smith selected to renounce medical procedure and rather developed his arm quality by means of weightlifting, playing through whatever torment he experienced. Said Smith, "I didn't enlighten anyone concerning the damage, since I needed to continue playing and didn't need anyone supposing they could keep running on me or exploit the damage. I attempted to do nearly everything, with the exception of toss a baseball, left-gave: opening an entryway, turning on the radioâeverything. It didn't beat that, however it was adequate that I didn't must have medical procedure." 

In light of his damage, Smith let his then four-year-old child Nikko play out his conventional Opening Day reverse somersault before the Cardinals' first home round of the 1986 season. Smith made an "eye-popping" play later that season on August 5, amid an amusement against the Philadelphia Phillies at Busch Stadium.

When I and the mentors assessed the play in spring preparingâthe entire diversionâRoyce began all around gradually unpleasantly and you could see him begin to show signs of improvement. By what he had the capacity to do protectively and on the bases, Royce had the right to play most of the recreations." 

Smith missed the principal month of the period with hamstring damage, and kept on harboring sick emotions toward La Russa that had created in the wake of spring preparing finished.
