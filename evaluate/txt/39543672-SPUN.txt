In the wake of involving staff positions amid the early long periods of World WarÂ II, Hely was selected Officer Commanding No.Â 72 Wing in Dutch New Guinea in May 1944. Soon thereafter he shaped No.Â 84 (Army Cooperation) Wing, telling it amid the Bougainville Campaign until the finish of the Pacific War.

He graduated as a lieutenant on 9Â December 1930, and the next day enrolled in the RAAF. 

Just as the four alumni the Air Force had tried out 1927, budgetary requirements forced amid the Great Depression required the exchange from Duntroon to Point Cook of eight other RAAF-supported cadets halfway through their four-year course, including Alister Murdoch, Bill Garing and Douglas Candy. At first positioned pilot officer, Hely initiated his flying instructional class at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, on 15Â January 1931, graduating on 10Â December. His initial postings as a pilot in 1932 and 1933 were to RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria. Qualifying in airborne photography, he served at Point Cook from 1933 to 1936. He was then exchanged to No.Â 3 Squadron at Richmond, getting advancement to flight lieutenant. 

In April 1936, Hely took order of No.Â 3 Squadron's North Australia Survey Flight, one of two such flights framed by the Air Force that month to complete photographic reviews. Flying a twin-engined de Havilland Dragon Rapide (sequential number A3-2), Hely left Richmond on 11Â April for Port Hedland, which was to be the flight's base for its underlying overview work in Western Australia.

He and his team of two were found by RAAF seek flying machine ten days after the fact, on 22Â April. "The Argus" had announced that "grave feelings of trepidation" were held for their wellbeing, however they were to a great extent healthy, Hely having endured slices and scraped areas to his head and leg. The flying machine was seriously harmed and must be transported back to Richmond in pieces. In February 1937, Hely participated in the scan for a missing Stinson carrier that was in the long run found in the McPherson Range, Queensland, five of its seven travelers and team dead. 

For its 1937 airborne review program, the RAAF framed the Communications and Survey Flight under No.Â 1 Aircraft Depot's Recruit Training Squadron at Laverton on 3Â May. The flight was separated into Western and Eastern Air Detachments, the previous under Hely. Flying a Tugan Gannet, Hely's first assignment wound up looking for study executive Sir Herbert Gepp, whose Rapide (A3-2, a similar one Hely crash handled the earlier year) had disappeared on an assessment trip in the Northern Territory between Tennant Creek and Tanimi. Hely found the brought down Rapide on 23Â May, managing in a ground party that had the capacity to clear a temporary runway and permit Gepp and his group to take off and continue their adventure. On 25Â September, Hely was again occupied from study work to look for a lost plane, this time the de Havilland Gipsy Moth of flying specialist Clyde Fenton, who had disappeared north-east of Newcastle Waters. Hely, afresh steering Rapide A3-2, found the Moth three days after the fact and arrived to protect the lost specialist. Fenton was consequently cited as saying "I have just the most elevated commendation for the effective way in which Hely directed a troublesome inquiry and the skilful manner by which he found me and lifted me up". The salvage endeavors made Hely one of the RAAF's best-known open figures. Finishing his presenting on the study flight, he filled in as aide at Laverton in 1938. He was granted the Air Force Cross on 9Â June for "energy and activity in hunting down Sir Herbert Gepp's gathering and later for Dr. Fenton when lost in Central Australia". On 29Â November 1938, he wedded secretary Jean McDonald at St Aidan's Anglican Church in Launceston, Tasmania; the couple would have two little girls.

Containing warrior and plunge plane squadrons, the wing had been built up to embrace air resistance and watch assignments in and around western New Guinea. Hely withdrew Merauke in September 1944 to build up a military collaboration development, No.Â 84 Wing, in Cairns, Queensland. It was one of two such wings framed by the RAAF in the South West Pacific Theater late in World WarÂ II. They were, as portrayed by the official history of the RAAF in the Pacific, "basically non-hostile in character", in charge of observation, big guns spotting, supply drops to ground powers, splashing DDT to battle intestinal sickness, and controlling close help airplane to their destinations. The wing could likewise do its very own strikes on "focuses of chance". No. 84 Wing contained No.Â 5 (Tactical Reconnaissance) Squadron, No.Â 17 Air Observation Post Flight, No.Â 10 Communication Unit (therefore renamed No.Â 10 Local Air Supply Unit), and No.Â 39 Operational Base Unit.

Between December 1944 and January 1945, the wing lost one Auster, one Wirraway, and one Boomerang on activities. In spite of deficiencies of pilots and hardware, Hely's arrangement was commonly ready to keep pace with the military's necessities. Before the finish of June 1945, it had flown more than 4,000 fights. 

Hely surrendered direction of No.Â 84 Wing on 12Â August 1945 and came back to RAAF Headquarters in October. He was at this point among a circle of officers at gathering skipper level, including Val Hancock, Alister Murdoch and Bill Garing, reserved by the Australian Air Board for influential positions in the post-war RAAF, which was to recoil quickly with deactivation.

In September, he was selected Officer Commanding Western Area, Perth, taking up his new post in mid-October. He was elevated to acting air commodore in July 1952, getting to be Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Western Area. His rank was made changeless in September, and that month he was named confidant to Queen ElizabethÂ II.

In August, he was named Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS), with the acting position of air bad habit marshal, powerful from October; he supplanted Air Vice Marshal Hancock. 

Between October 1953 and February 1954, the RAAF experienced major hierarchical change, as it progressed from a geologically based order and-control framework to one dependent on capacity, bringing about the foundation of Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. In the meantime, RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne was consumed by the Department of Air in Canberra. Hely was acting Air Member for Personnel from 3Â January to 7Â March 1955, between the terms of Air Vice Marshals Val Hancock and Fred Scherger. On 24Â January 1956, he progressed toward becoming AOC Training Command, taking over from Air Vice Marshal Murdoch. He was prevailing as DCAS via Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy. Hely's position of air bad habit marshal ended up substantive on 5Â September.

In charge of the Personnel Branch of the RAAF, the situation of AMP involved a seat broadcasting live Board, the administration's controlling body that contained its senior officers and was led by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS). The Air Force extended incredibly amid Hely's term as AMP, inferable from Australia's expanding pledge to the security of South East Asia, and the most critical rearmament program the RAAF had attempted outside of World WarÂ II. Its lasting foundation expanded from an unfaltering 15,000 or so during the 1950s to more than 18,000 by 1966. Hely himself started a plan to pull in staff from the Royal Air Force, which was enduring reductions, by opening an enlistment office in London and exploiting the Australian government's helped entry plan to import prepared work force and their families. He was delegated a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1964 New Year Honors for his "prudent and cautious treatment of faculty matters", and for having "done a lot to improve the keeping an eye on dimension of the Air Force". As AMP, Hely advanced recommendations to expand the quantity of certificate qualified designing and hardware officers in the Air Force. He was additionally firmly associated with thoughts concerning the parity of scholarly and military examinations at the RAAF Academy (already RAAF College), the result of which is considered to have left the course one-sided towards unadulterated science, instead of its applications to air control. 

Hely resigned on 24Â August 1966, after just about forty years in the military. He was succeeded the next day as AMP via Air Vice Marshal Candy. In retirement, Hely was dynamic in the Canberra part of the Air Force Association. He kicked the bucket of malignant growth in Canberra on 20Â May 1970.
