Sonic Adventure 

Following the wiping out of the Sega Saturn diversion "Sonic X-treme", Sonic Team started chip away at "Sonic Adventure" in 1997. A 60-part improvement group made the diversion in ten months, drawing motivation from areas in Peru and Guatemala. Yuji Uekawa updated the characters for their progress to 3D, and highlights were added to exploit the Dreamcast equipment. Sega declared the amusement in August 1998; it was discharged in Japan that December and worldwide in September 1999. 

The diversion got basic recognition and, with 2.5 million duplicates sold by August 2006, turned into the Dreamcast's success. Analysts praised the visuals and ongoing interaction, considering it a noteworthy mechanical progression; some guessed that it could restore Sega as the overwhelming console maker after the generally ineffective Saturn. Others were baffled by the camera controls and glitches, and responses to its sound were blended. Notwithstanding this, writers have positioned "Sonic Adventure" among the best "Sonic" recreations, and it is perceived as a vital discharge in both the arrangement and the stage type. A continuation, "Sonic Adventure 2", was discharged in 2001. 

"Sonic Adventure" was ported to the GameCube and Windows in 2003 as "Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut", highlighting refreshed designs and more difficulties. A top notch adaptation was discharged carefully for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 of every 2010, and for Windows in 2011. Audits for these renditions were more negative; faultfinders felt the diversion had not matured well and kept running at a conflicting casing rate. 

"Sonic Adventure" is a 3D stage amusement with activity and pretending components. Players control one of six human heroes as they dare to overcome Doctor Robotnik and his robot armed force, who look for the seven otherworldly Chaos Emeralds and the underhanded substance Chaos. Six player characters are opened as the amusement advances, each with their very own story and traits. Sonic the Hedgehog plays out a turn dash, homing assault, and light-speed dash; Miles "Tails" Prower flies, swims, and assaults robots utilizing his tails; Knuckles the Echidna skims, climbs dividers, and punches; Amy Rose can vanquish foes utilizing her sledge; Big the Cat is moderate and conveys an angling pole he can cast; and E-102 Gamma can shoot laser pillars. 

Toward the beginning of the diversion, the player is set in one of a few Adventure Fields, open-finished center point universes occupied by counsel giving non-player characters. The player character is guided and trained by the voice of Tikal the Echidna. Through investigation, the player finds passages to levels called Action Stages, some of which must be opened utilizing keys covered up in the Adventure Field. When the player gets to an Action Stage, they are entrusted with a particular goal, which is distinctive for each character. Sonic and Amy must achieve the dimension's end; Tails must achieve the end before Sonic; Knuckles must discover three concealed shards of the Master Emerald; Big should angle for his pet frog; and Gamma must battle his way through stages utilizing shots as a resistance. 

A few dimensions incorporate minigames separate from the fundamental story. These component distinctive styles of interactivity, among them rail shooting, dashing, and sandboarding. Some minigames must be gotten to with specific characters. Satisfying certain destinations enables the player to acquire extra things. Opened minigames and stages the player has finished can be gotten to from a Trial Mode on the title screen. 

Like past "Sonic the Hedgehog" amusements, players gather brilliant rings as a type of wellbeing: if the player character is in control of rings when they are hit by a foe or other danger, they will endure, however their rings will disperse and flicker before vanishing. Canisters containing catalysts, for example, speed shoes, extra rings, power, and essential shields are likewise covered up in levels. In a few phases, the player connects with Robotnik or Chaos in a supervisor battle and should exhaust the manager's wellbeing meter to continue. Each character begins with a predetermined number of lives, and the player loses an actual existence if the character suffocates, gets pulverized, or is hit with no rings in their ownership. The diversion closes when the player comes up short on lives. Lives can be renewed by gathering 100 rings or a 1-up. 

Players may likewise find Chao Gardens, covered up, defensive situations occupied by Chao, a virtual pet. Players can incubate, name, and interface with a Chao, and raise the status of their Chao by giving it little creatures found by crushing robots. The Dreamcast's handheld Visual Memory Unit (VMU) enables the player to download the minigame "Chao Adventure", in which their Chao strolls through a course to develop and improve its aptitudes. Advancing one's Chao improves its execution in rivalries called Chao Races. Eggs that can deliver extraordinary kinds of Chao are covered up all through the Adventure Fields. Players can procure tokens by playing through Action Stages, seeking through the Adventure Fields, or winning Chao Races. Each Action Stage has three seals that can be earned by replaying the stages and satisfying destinations, for example, beating the dimension inside a period limit. 

Specialist Robotnik looks for another approach to overcome his long-lasting enemy Sonic and vanquish the world. Amid his exploration, he finds out around a substance called Chaosâan animal that, a large number of years back, secured the Chao and the almighty Master Emerald, which adjusts the intensity of the seven Chaos Emeralds. At the point when a clan of echidnas looked to take the intensity of the Emeralds, breaking the agreement they had with the Chao, Chaos struck back by utilizing the Emeralds' capacity to change into an enormous mammoth, Perfect Chaos, and wipe them out. Before it could annihilate the world, Tikal, a youthful echidna who become a close acquaintence with Chaos, detained it in the Master Emerald alongside herself. 

Looking to utilize Chaos, Robotnik discharges it from the Master Emerald, and tests the animal's normal structure on the city of Station Square. At the point when Sonic sees nearby police neglect to crush it, he and Tails work to prevent Robotnik from engaging it with the Chaos Emeralds. In the meantime, Knuckles, the main outstanding echidna, embarks to discover the shards of the Master Emerald and fix it. Actuating another arrangement of robots, including one named Gamma, Robotnik orders them to discover Froggy, a land and water proficient who had eaten a Chaos Emerald in the wake of transforming from contact with a bit of Chaos the night he was discharged. His proprietor Big tries to discover him too. In Station Square, Sonic's companion Amy finds a Flicky being sought after for a Chaos Emerald in its ownership, and chooses to ensure it. At the point when both are caught, Amy persuades Gamma not to work for Robotnik, who encourages her to get away, before searching out and annihilating different robots in his arrangement, relinquishing himself all the while. 

Notwithstanding Sonic figuring out how to disturb Robotnik's arrangements, Chaos figures out how to assimilate all the Chaos Emeralds. Changing into Perfect Chaos, it defies Robotnik and assaults Station Square, pulverizing the city. Having encountered flashbacks from Tikal, who was discharged herself, Sonic understands that Chaos has been in consistent torment and distress, and that detaining it again won't stop it. Utilizing the Emeralds conveyed to him by the others to change into his super structure, Sonic battles Perfect Chaos and annihilations it. Come back to ordinary, Chaos quiets down when he sees the Chao living calmly in Station Square. Understanding its torment is gone, Tikal chooses to take it some place safe to live in harmony. With Sonic having won, he chooses to leave to seek after an escaping Robotnik. 

Amid the mid 1990s, Sega was a standout amongst the best computer game organizations because of its Genesis reassure. Deals for the comfort were driven by the notoriety of its lead establishment of 2D platformers, "Sonic the Hedgehog". Amid this time, arrangement co-maker Yuji Naka worked with Sega Technical Institute (STI) in the United States to create "Sonic" amusements. After the finishing of "Sonic and Knuckles" in 1994, Naka moved to work with Sonic Team in Japan. STI started creating "Sonic X-treme" for the Sega Saturn"," which would have been the main "Sonic the Hedgehog" diversion to highlight full 3D ongoing interaction. "X-treme" endured a progression of mishaps and was dropped in 1997. The wiping out is a critical factor in the Saturn's business disappointment; without it, the framework had no unique "Sonic" platformer. Then, Naka and Sonic Team created unique Saturn recreations, for example, "Evenings into Dreams." Due to the arrangement's overall absence of quality on the Saturn, as indicated by "Retro Gamer", "[b]y mid-1997 Sonic had basically been rearranged away from plain sight... it was surprising to see that only six years after his introduction, Sonic was at that point retro." 

Naka still needed to make a 3D "Sonic" amusement, and felt that just Sonic Team ought to do it; thus, he would not let STI utilize the "Evenings" diversion motor for "X-treme", a factor in that diversion's undoing. In August 1996, "Evenings into Dreams" creator Takashi Iizuka proposed a pretending style "Sonic" diversion with a more prominent accentuation on narrating, which framed the premise of "Sonic Adventure". Iizuka felt that "Sonic" fans had been let down in light of the fact that the group was not concentrating on the arrangement. Also, Kazuyuki Hoshino, who might fill in as workmanship executive on "Sonic Adventure", said he thought amid the Saturn time Sonic had turned out to be obsolete and endeavored to rethink the character. 

Sonic Team began to deal with "Sonic Adventure" in April 1997 on the Saturn with a 20-in number group. Sonic Team made the primary model utilizing the "Evenings" motor, yet the Saturn's constrained capacities made improvement troublesome. Sega president Hayao Nakayama educated Naka of the Saturn's successor, the Dreamcast, and he trusted the new comfort would enable Sonic Team to make a definitive "Sonic" amusement. At the point when the group took in the Dreamcast was nearing fulfillment, they moved improvement to exploit its more prominent amount of RAM, more grounded CPU, and the VMU. Not having any desire to squander their finished work, they set it as a little something extra in the accumulation diversion "Sonic Jam", the last "Sonic" amusement for the Saturn. In July 1997, Sonic Team started redeveloping "Sonic Adventure" for the Dreamcast, and the group extended to 60. 

Iizuka filled in as chief on "Sonic Adventure", while Naka delivered. In spite of the fact that at the time one of the biggest computer games made, "Sonic Adventure" was finished in a moderately short 10 months. Sonic Team embraced advancement related to the Dreamcast, expecting to discharge the amusement in December 1998, regardless of whether it implied making upgrades after discharge. Creating "Sonic Adventure" in the meantime as the framework, which was not finished until two months before the diversion's discharge, gave Iizuka impact over the reassure's advancement; for instance, he had the capacity to demand more RAM for the comfort explicitly for "Sonic Adventure". 

Sonic Team felt tested by the new equipment to reproduce Sonic and his reality recently. They started advancement utilizing the character structures from the Genesis recreations, however immediately found the characters' bodies were excessively short and their heads too huge, making them hard to see. Yuji Uekawa overhauled each character to suit the progress to 3D and to give them "new, tense, increasingly Western" plan. Looking to the activity of Walt Disney and "Looney Tunes" for motivation, he made Sonic progressively develop, taller, and slimmer, and gave him longer plumes. He obscured his blue shading and gave him green irises in reference to Green Hill Zone. Uekawa attempted to make Sonic resemble a comic book character and contrasted the style with spray painting. Subsequent to upgrading Sonic, he made different characters fit this new workmanship style. 

Since "Sonic Adventure" was a Dreamcast dispatch title, the group endeavored to exhibit the reassure's abilities with practical designs, which they felt would interest buyers. To accomplish a progressively sensible feel for the conditions, the center individuals from Sonic Team visited sanctuaries, wildernesses, and old destroys in Mesoamerican scenes, including Cancun, Guatemala, and Peru. While Sonic Team individuals needed to draw work of art by hand for recreations before, for "Sonic Adventure" they had the capacity to utilize photos taken amid their visits as surfaces. The best impacts were the Tikal ruin in Guatemala and Machu Picchu in Peru. The character Tikal was motivated by Peru and took her name from the Guatemalan vestiges. The group additionally needed to include components surprising in a stage diversion; the dimension in which Tails sandboards was roused by a gathering of sandboarders in Ica, Peru. The 3D visuals were made utilizing a Voodoo2 illustrations chip. 

One of the greatest difficulties the fashioners confronted was changing the arrangement's 2D style to 3D. In the Genesis "Sonic" diversions, the player basically needed to go ideal to achieve the finish of a dimension, however in "Sonic Adventure" they could move toward each path. The architects made models for the phases before testing it as the player character, bringing about experimentation. A few dimensions, for example, the Lost World, were revamped many occasions; others referenced past Sega recreations, for example, Ice Cap ("Sonic the Hedgehog 3") and the Tornado levels ("Panzer Dragoon"). One specific trouble was crushing adversaries; in the 2D amusements, foes were beaten essentially by hopping on them, however this was more enthusiastically to accomplish in a 3D diversion. In this manner, Sonic was enabled to target adversaries in mid-air. Iizuka said the true to life groupings were considered to exploit the situations, "giving the player a component of disclosure notwithstanding the platforming". 

Stages included ongoing interaction like the first Genesis amusements and were intended to take no less than five minutes to finish. Sonic Team split dimensions into parts to spare memory. Since "Sonic Adventure" had a more grounded accentuation on narrating than past recreations in the arrangement, the group executed center point universes to "draw the players more profound into the world." The center point universes' accentuation on investigating to discover new regions and catalysts was propelled by "The Legend of Zelda". When seeing the finished dimension plans, Iizuka and Naka chose to re-reason them for other player characters. Iizuka said they felt it would be "a waste if Sonic just rapidly went through the dimensions that we invested so much energy making". The main characters other than Sonic added to the amusement were Tails and Knuckles; Tails' stages transformed parts of Sonic's dimensions into races, while Knuckles' fortune chasing missions were planned as a difference to the others' clear ones. "Sonic Adventure" was the first run through Amy was playable in a "Sonic" platformer, and Iizuka expected to utilize her to include strain, for example, escaping followers, that Sonic's interactivity couldn't offer. 

"Sonic Adventure" highlights two new playable characters, Big and Gamma. Sonic Team had effectively actualized an in-diversion angling pole with no unique circumstance or use, prompting the formation of Big. Enormous was intended to be monster and loose so the player would not expect something increasingly exceptional. Gamma and his playstyle were made in light of fans who needed components of a shoot them up in "Sonic" and due to Iizuka's longing to incorporate "some kind of fulfilling ongoing interaction that wasn't possible with Sonic". Neither Big nor Gamma were expected to assume a vast job, therefore both of their battles were short. Iizuka likewise needed to make a lowlife who might have been difficult to make on more established equipment. He settled on something fluid and straightforward and made Chaos. Iizuka displayed the idea to Naka, who was awed. Tumult was initially planned to have practical blue scales in his last structure, however this was relinquished as a result of the innovative imperatives of the Dreamcast. 

As indicated by Iizuka, the group endeavored to incorporate however much substance as could be expected. One expansion was the Chao-raising framework, which Iizuka considered to exploit the VMU. Sonic Team had utilized a comparable virtual pet framework, the "A-Life", in "Evenings into Dreams"; Iizuka utilized the A-Life as a base, while improving it with the VMU and the choice to improve its abilities. Iizuka trusted it would be made into a character players could contact and raise. It was likewise intended to speak to easygoing gamers curious about recreations like "Sonic", and to include replay esteem. The plan set aside significant effort to settle and must be made as straightforward as conceivable on the grounds that the virtual pet's look changes structure as it advances. 

While some "Sonic" recreations, for example, 1993's "Sonic CD", contained constrained voice work, "Sonic Adventure" was the primary "Sonic" amusement to include broad voice acting. The choice was made from the get-go being developed as the amusement was more story-centered than past "Sonic" diversions. Sonic Team's staff had contrasting suppositions about how Sonic should sound. Iizuka reviewed that the main component they concurred on was to abstain from utilizing an anime voice performing artist, supporting a film performer with a "preposterous" voice. Sonic Team give Jun'ichi Kanemaru a role as Sonic. In a meeting commending his 30th commemoration as a voice on-screen character, Kanemaru said one reason he was thrown was a direct result of his capacity to communicate in English. The English-language voice cast comprises of Ryan Drummond as Sonic, Corey Bringas as Tails, Michael McGaharn as Knuckles, Jennifer Douillard as Amy, Jon St. John as Big, and Deem Bristow as Robotnik. 

"Sonic Adventure"s score was fundamentally made by Jun Senoue, with extra music by Fumie Kumatani, Kenichi Tokoi, and Masaru Setsumaru. The gathering made the primary topic, "Open Your Heart"; other vocal subjects were performed by Marion Saunders, Dredd Fox, Ted Poley, Nikki Gregoroff, Tony Harnell, and Johnny Gioeli. The group favored "hot, out of control, and shake 'n' move" music over the electropop of prior "Sonic" recreations. Iizuka expressed the style was embraced on the grounds that the Dreamcast's sound was a critical development from that of the Genesis. A few tracks were adjusted from the 1996 diversion "Sonic 3D Blast". A two-plate soundtrack, "Sonic Adventure "Digi-LOG Conversation" Original Sound Track", was discharged in Japan in January 1999. In May 2011, a twentieth commemoration version of the soundtrack was discharged. Advanced forms were additionally discharged on iTunes and Spotify in September 2014 and January 2017, separately. Daring Wave Productions discharged a vinyl LP adaptation of the soundtrack incorporating interviews with Senoue and Iizuka in 2018. 

"Sonic Adventure" was stayed quiet amid generation, however screen captures were spilled in mid-1998 and plans for a 3D "Sonic" diversion had for quite some time been reputed. It was disclosed by Naka and the remainder of Sonic Team on August 22, 1998, at the Tokyo International Forum. The group flaunted a few unique components, for example, a pursuit arrangement from the principal level and Tails' sandboarding succession. Naka portrayed the introduction as extraordinary, having "[given his] all" to make it fit for discharge. 

On December 23, 1998, "Sonic Adventure" was discharged in Japan. The Japanese form delivered with numerous glitches and camera issues; a few individuals from Sonic Team traveled to Sega of America to fix the diversion, deferring its western discharge for a while. The limited adaptation was discharged in North America on September 9, 1999, and in Europe on September 23, 1999. It incorporates Japanese and English-language sound tracks, just as Japanese, English, Spanish, French and German captions. Online highlightsâincluding Chao childcare and downloadable substance (DLC, for example, minigames and new dimension resourcesâwere likewise included. The confined variant was later discharged in Japan as "Sonic Adventure International". 

Before the dispatch of the Dreamcast in the United States, Sega made a selective arrangement with Hollywood Video to enable clients to lease the Dreamcast support alongside a non-retail form of the amusement, "Sonic Adventure: Limited Edition". The advancement started on July 15, 1999 and occurred at 1,055 Hollywood Video stores the nation over. 

In 2001, Sega declared it would change from a first-gathering to an outsider programming distributer. Needing to achieve new players by making an upgraded rendition of one of their more established recreations, in June 2003 Sega discharged "Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut", a port of "Sonic Adventure" for the GameCube and Windows. While for the most part indistinguishable to the first discharge, "Sonic Adventure DX" highlights refreshed illustrations, including higher-goals surfaces and increasingly nitty gritty character models, has a bolted edge rate of 60 outlines for every second, and sports an upgraded Chao-raising framework that utilizes network with the Game Boy Advance (GBA). It incorporates 60 new missions and the alternative to open every one of the 12 "Sonic" amusements discharged for the Game Gear. Metal Sonic can be opened as a playable character if every one of the 130 symbols are gathered. These highlights were added to speak to players of the first diversion. 

In September 2010, Sega rereleased "Sonic Adventure" as a downloadable amusement for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, trailed by a Windows discharge in March 2011 by means of Steam. This form depends on "Sonic Adventure DX" and supports top quality visuals, yet the new missions, Metal Sonic, and the Game Gear recreations were evacuated; the missions and Metal Sonic can be reimplemented by obtaining them as DLC. The amusement was likewise incorporated into the "Dreamcast Collection" assemblage in 2011, and is in reverse good with the Xbox One. 

As the first completely 3D "Sonic" stage diversion, "Sonic Adventure" was profoundly foreseen. It got basic recognition, and a few commentators called it one of the best computer games ever. It is the top of the line Dreamcast amusement; by August 4, 2006, it had sold 2.5 million duplicates, incorporating 440,000 in Japan and 1.27 million in the United States. 

The visuals and introduction pulled in wide recognition. "Arcade" magazine depicted it as a "quantum jump forward" in style and visual detail in computer games, and "Hyper" assessed they even surpassed what was conceivable on top of the line PCs. "IGN" considered it the most graphically amazing stage amusement discharged up to that date, adulating its true to life arrangements and depicting it as "engaging, requesting, and absolutely spectacular". "GameSpot" concurred and said just "Soulcalibur"s graphical quality outperformed that of "Sonic Adventure". "Edge" felt the graphical highlights flaunted the Dreamcast's capability without limitations and that the diversion was "immaculate" as a feature for the framework. 

The sound got blended reactions. "GameSpot" and "Amusement Revolution" called the full-movement video (FMV) cutscenes and voice acting all around delivered and fitting, however "GameSpot" noted poor lip-syncing. "IGN" thought the cutscenes were dreary and voiced solid dissatisfaction with the voice acting, announcing it "a total joke" and "absolute terrible". "IGN" had a specific dislike for Tails' voice, and reflectively called it among the most irritating to include in a computer game. "AllGame" was clashed; they valued Tails' depiction however discovered Sonic's and Knuckles' voices unfitting. "GameSpot" and "AllGame" applauded the stone style music, yet "Amusement Revolution" depicted the score as "completely horrendous". 

The ongoing interaction was by and large commended. "GameSpot" appreciated the direct, straight way to deal with the 3D stage classification and especially lauded it for keeping the essential ongoing interaction of the first Genesis diversions. "IGN" said the amusement would keep players occupied even after consummation, taking note of its web availability and different additional items. Then again, "Diversion Revolution" said separated from being snappier, it didn't propel the stage sort's structure. Reflectively, "1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die" called its surroundings huge and wound, expressing it "splendidly" caught conventional "Sonic" components. 

The Chao minigame was noted as a noteworthy takeoff from the ongoing interaction of the arrangement. "GameSpot" composed that "while actually only a preoccupation", the Chao were an intriguing, fun expansion, singling out their web capacities as a feature. "AllGame" said the Chao helped increment the replay esteem, despite the fact that it was "weird", required tolerance, and did not give rewards in the fundamental amusement. "Diversion Revolution" called the Chao "a perfect expansion" and adulated its utilization of the VMU. 

A few faultfinders thought about "Sonic Adventure" to "Super Mario 64"â Nintendo's "momentous" 1996 amusement that pushed the Nintendo 64 and the 3D stage class. "Edge" said "Sonic Adventure" was a commendable adversary to "Super Mario 64", yet "AllGame" composed that "Sonic Adventure" was not as aggressive and that those searching for investigation would be baffled with its direct interactivity. They contrasted it with the likewise direct "Crash Bandicoot" however felt "Sonic Adventure" was increasingly kept. All things considered, they applauded the ongoing interaction as differed and said its replay esteem was solid. Amusement writers Rusel DeMaria and Johnny L. Wilson reflectively stated "Sonic Adventure" was not as solid as "Super Mario 64" and "neglected to get on with players in about the manner in which that ["Mario"] had done", however it had interesting highlights, for example, "the utilization of the Tamagotchi-like memory card to hatch eggs for minimal pet animals" and "some great activity fragments". 

The camera framework and glitches were condemned by numerous commentators. "IGN" called the camera "staggeringly" disappointing and conflicting, and "GameSpot" noted it caused issues with crash discovery. "Edge" whined the camera here and there goes behind dividers. Creators from "GamesRadar" reflectively composed that "Sonic Adventure" was "horribly surrey", singling out falling through floors and stalling out, yet in addition said the sheer measure of substance compensated for this. 

"GameSpot" thought "Sonic Adventure" reclassified the potential outcomes of the stage class, and as indicated by "PC and Video Games" ("CVG"), "numerous things you thought were difficult to see and involvement in PC amusements are presently here". "AllGame" composed that the diversion was a noteworthy appearing of the Dreamcast's potential and that it was among the best of the arrangement. "Edge" said its reactions, for example, view spring up and occurrences of poor crash recognition are "minor defects in a generally fine bit of work". "Arcade" and "CVG" guessed the amusement could spare the Dreamcast, which had not sold well before the finish of 1998. "CVG" likewise figured it could restore Sega as the overwhelming console maker after the moderately ineffective Saturn. 

"Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut" was gotten less decidedly than the first. "GameSpot" was frustrated the rerelease did not address the issues of the first form, chafed the illustrations were just possibly extraordinary, and disappointed with its crash location. They offered some applause for the additional highlights, for example, the missions, yet finished up players were in an ideal situation playing the Dreamcast rendition. "IGN" concurred, calling it "a messy port of a diversion that has for quite some time been undeserving of its high recognition." "IGN" noticed its regular edge rate drops and called its camera one of the most exceedingly awful they had ever observed. They said the network to the GBA "Sonic" diversions included profundity however finished up this did not make up for the issues in the port. "Nintendo World Report" was increasingly positive, commending the Game Gear diversions for holding their multiplayer backing and discovering Sonic and Tails' ongoing interaction charming. 

Audits of the 2010 rerelease were commonly troublesome; the greater part of the analysis was aimed at the apparent absence of exertion put into the port. "IGN" called it "so on a very basic level imperfect that it verges on unplayable", seeing that the segments that worked best required minimal contribution from the player. They scrutinized the absence of widescreen support however offered minor acclaim for its unfaltering casing rate. "1UP.com" bludgeoned the port for what they called its slapdash quality, censuring its showcase, controls, and dated plan, and saying it "has an inclination that it wasn't tuned for the Xbox 360 controller and its simple sticks". "Destructoid" was less cruel, composing that fanatics of the establishment would most likely appreciate the diversion however cautioned easygoing players that "all you'll discover is a relic that was once viewed as enormity", and that it tormented them to state that. 

Preceding the arrival of "Sonic Adventure", most 3D stage amusements concentrated on investigation and gathering things; "Sonic Adventure" changed this with its straight ongoing interaction. As indicated by "GamesRadar", it was one of the main 6th era support amusements and changed the business "everlastingly", in spite of its glitches. "Joystiq" composed that both "Experience" and the first "Sonic the Hedgehog" had advanced through powerful direct dimension structure and by inclination "great to play". In 2009, "GamePro" recorded "Sonic Adventure" as the seventh-best stage round ever, saying it had not matured well in specific angles but rather its center ongoing interaction stayed among the best of the "Sonic" arrangement. A few writers positioned the diversion among the arrangement's ideal, yet "Kotaku" contended the expansion of voice acting and more prominent spotlight on plot changed Sonic into "a level, inert husk of a character, who releases mottos and for the most part has just a single identity mode, the extreme frame of mind man, the pitiful reused picture of dubious '90s social idea". 

A significant number of "Sonic Adventure"s structures and ideas were reused in later "Sonic" diversions. The course, fundamental ongoing interaction, and Uekawa's modernized character plans progressed toward becoming arrangement staples. One dimension in the 2006 "Sonic the Hedgehog" reboot intensely references "Sonic Adventure"s Emerald Coast organize. To commend the "Sonic" arrangement's twentieth commemoration in 2011, Sega discharged "Sonic Generations", which reused perspectives from past diversions in the establishment. The Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Windows adaptations contain rethought renditions of the Speed Highway level and the Perfect Chaos manager battle, and the Nintendo 3DS variant contains a change of Emerald Coast. 

A few characters that previously showed up in "Sonic Adventure" showed up in later recreations. Just as showing up in "Sonic Generations", Chaos is an enemy in the 2017 passage "Sonic Forces"; it and Gamma are playable characters in the 2004 battling amusement "Sonic Battle"; and an entertainment of its supervisor battle shows up in "Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games". The Chao animals likewise include prevalently in later diversions. One of the characters presented in "Experience", Big the Cat, wound up notorious for his negative gathering. "Amusement Informer" considered his ongoing interaction excruciating and exhausting, while "Destructoid" denounced his depiction as a "rationally incapacitated blockhead" and his voice on-screen character's indistinguishable execution. Enormous is generally considered by computer game columnists the most noticeably awful character in the "Sonic" establishment, and was named one of the most exceedingly terrible diversion characters in a survey directed by "1UP.com". 

On October 4, 1999, Sega reported that a spin-off of "Sonic Adventure" was being developed. "Sonic Adventure 2" made its presentation at E3 2000 and was discharged in June 2001. The continuation was intended to be more activity arranged than the slower-paced, story-driven "Experience" and to give every one of the characters break even with recess. Like its ancestor, "Sonic Adventure 2" got positive audits. An idea for "Sonic Adventure 3" was improved into the 2008 diversion "Sonic Unleashed". In 2017, Iizuka expressed there were no designs for a third "Sonic Adventure" amusement, saying it would not propel the arrangement's structure. He didn't preclude the thought, saying "On the off chance that we can get the ongoing interaction to advance and get to a spot where "Experience 3" bodes well, at that point you may see an "Undertaking 3" turn out". In December 2018, Iizuka communicated enthusiasm for redoing "Sonic Adventure". 

The plot of "Sonic Adventure" was adjusted in the second period of the 2003 "Sonic the Hedgehog" anime arrangement "Sonic X". American permitting partnership 4Kids Entertainment procured another voice cast for the English-language name yet the Japanese cast from the diversions repeated their jobs in the first form of the show. Archie Comics additionally adjusted the amusement in its "Sonic the Hedgehog" comic book arrangement. The comic offered a clarification for the modified character structures and set up that Station Square was covered up underneath Sonic's planet, Mobius.
