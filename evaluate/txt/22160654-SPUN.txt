On 26Â June, after an eight-plane strike on Turkish Fourth Army home office in Jerusalem, Cole and another pilot endured motor seizures while undertaking a comparable salvage of a brought down friend; every one of the three aviators were compelled to stroll through a dead zone before being gotten by an Australian Light Horse watch. 

Elevated to chief in August 1917, Cole was presented on France as a flight officer with No.Â 2 Squadron AFC (additionally referred to until 1918 as No.Â 68 Squadron RFC). Flying S.E.5 warriors on the Western Front, he was credited with crushing or conveying of control ten adversary flying machine among July and October 1918, making him an expert. In a solitary foray over the Lys Valley on 19Â August, Cole shot down two German contenders and barely abstained from being shot down himself quickly a while later, when he was assaulted by five Fokker Triplanes that were being sought after by Allied Bristol Fighters.

Squadron Leader Cole was presented on England in 1923â 24 to go to RAF Staff College, Andover, coming back to Australia in 1925 to progress toward becoming Director of Personnel and Training. Elevated to wing administrator, he was accountable for No.Â 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS) at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, from 1926 to 1929. The principal Citizens Air Force (hold) pilots' course occurred amid Cole's residency at No. 1 FTS; albeit twenty-four mishaps happened, wounds were minor, driving him to comment at the graduation service that the understudies were either made of India elastic or had figured out how to crash "reasonably securely". 

Cole held direction of RAAF Station Laverton from 1929 until his arrangement as Air Member for Supply (AMS) in January 1933. The AMS involved a seat reporting in real time Board, which was led by the Chief of the Air Staff and was on the whole in charge of control and organization of the RAAF. In March 1932, Cole acknowledged a welcome from the Lord Mayor of Melbourne to fill in as Deputy Chairman of the 1934 MacRobertson Air Race from England to Australia, to observe Melbourne's Centenary. Arrangement of the RAAF's radio offices and professionals was viewed as a help for hopefuls, however Cole later recorded that his job included "twenty months' diligent work, without payÂ ... with heaps of vulgar and other analysis". Elevated to bunch skipper in January 1935, he turned into the debut leader (CO) of Headquarters RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, on 20Â April 1936. The new home office, which had been framed from components of two of the base's tenant units, No.Â 3 Squadron and No.Â 2 Aircraft Depot, superseded a prior game plan where the CO of No.Â 3 Squadron had served as the station officer. Cole was delegated a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Coronation Honors of 11Â May 1937, and went to the Imperial Defense College in London the next year.

As a major aspect of the RAAF's revamping following the flare-up of World WarÂ II in September 1939, No.Â 2 Group was framed in Sydney on 20Â November, with Cole in order. The gathering controlled Air Force units in New South Wales. Cole was raised to impermanent air commodore in December, and assumed responsibility for Central Area Command, which displaced No.Â 2 Group, when it was built up in the new year. In September 1941, he was sent to North Africa as Officer Commanding No.Â 235 Wing RAF of the Desert Air Force, where he built up another enemy of submarine fighting unit, No.Â 459 Squadron RAAF. Presented on England with Headquarters No.Â 11 Group in May 1942, he filled in as Forward Air Controller of the Dieppe Raid on 19Â August, in charge of co-ordinating Allied air spread off the French coast on board HMS "Calpe". In doing as such, he was truly injured in the jaw and chest area when German contenders strafed the ship; he required plastic medical procedure and went through half a month recovering.

That month, he was made Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAF Northern Ireland, with the acting position of air bad habit marshal, however the order was depicted in the official history of Australia in the war as a "backwater". 

In May 1943, Cole came back to Australia, taking over as AOC North-Western Area Command from Air Commodore Frank Bladin in July. Situated in Darwin, Northern Territory, he was in charge of territorial air barrier, observation, assurance of Allied sending and, later, hostile activities in the New Guinea crusade. Cole found the direction "healthy" however considered its air barrier capacity insufficient, prescribing increase by long-run warriors, for example, the P-38 Lightning. He all things considered needed to manage with the three squadrons of Spitfires as of now on his quality, and the likelihood of approaching the USAAF's Fifth Air Force for fortifications as important. Amid August and September, he diminished normal observation missions to "increment besieging action as far as possible", after a solicitation from General Douglas MacArthur to give all accessible help to Allied strikes on Laeâ Nadzab. North-Western Area B-24 Liberators, Hudsons, Beaufighters and Catalinas completed attacks to devastate Japanese bases and airplane, and occupy adversary powers from Allied segments.

The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, got an unknown letter asserting that Cole had turned out to be flushed and lost control at a wreck meeting on 8Â November. Examining the issue, Jones was unfit to build up whether Cole had been smashed however was fulfilled that he had not carried on fittingly, and issued him a notice without charging or generally training him. Under strain from the Federal government, Jones rejected Cole from the situation of AMP and presented him on Ceylon in January 1945 as RAAF Liaison Officer to South East Asia Command. Cole served in this job until the finish of the war, participating in dealings for the Japanese capitulation and going about as Australia's senior delegate at the formal surrender function in Singapore on 12Â September 1945. 

Cole was summarily resigned from the RAAF in 1946, alongside a few other senior commandants and veterans of World WarÂ I, essentially to clear path for the progression of more youthful and similarly competent officers. In a prior moment to the Minister for Air, Arthur Drakeford, with respect to post-war direction prospects, Air Vice Marshal Jones had evaluated Cole as having neglected to show "sure of those characteristics expected to be controlled by senior officers of such position". Regardless, his job abroad was excess. Cole, as far as it matters for him, later kept in touch with the Melbourne "Envoy" that he considered the RAAF's organization amid World WarÂ II to be "frail", and that as an outcome he felt "much more joyful to serve the vast majority of the War with the Royal Air Force". 

Positioned substantive air commodore and privileged air bad habit marshal, Cole was formally released from the RAAF on 17Â April 1946. He disdained being coercively resigned, and represented decision as the Liberal Party possibility for Drakeford's seat, the Victorian Division of Maribyrnong, in the government race that year. Cole expressed that his application was "an undertaking to convey some sense and security to Government organization" yet was fruitless, and Drakeford held the seat. Cole therefore filled in as a chief with Pacific Insurance and Guinea Airways. He kicked the bucket in Melbourne of endless respiratory malady on 14Â February 1966. Made due by his significant other and four youngsters, he was covered in Camperdown Cemetery, Victoria, following a burial service at RAAF Base Laverton.

His embellishments were held by the Naval and Military Club, Melbourne, where he had been a long-standing part. In July 2009, after the club's disintegration, the decorations were to be unloaded alongside other memorabilia. This activity was tested by Cole's family, who contended that his designs were just on credit to the club, and ought to be given to the Australian War Memorial (AWM). As the Supreme Court of Victoria thought working on it, the gatherings included arranged a settlement whereby Cole's awards would be exchanged to the AWM.
