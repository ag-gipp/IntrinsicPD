While dwelling at Portsmouth, McNicoll and his better half had their first youngster, a child named Ian, in June that year. Ian kicked the bucket when multi week old. The couple later had two additional children, Guy and Anthony, and a little girl, Deborah. 

On 14 September 1939, eleven days after the episode of the Second World War, McNicoll was presented on HMS "Triumph", the leader of Admiral Sir William James, the Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth. In April 1940, McNicoll was exchanged to the light cruiser as an individual from the ship's dispatching team. Amid McNicoll's time on board the ship, it was seriously harmed by a torpedo in tasks on 1 September and scarcely made it back to harbor.

While cruising in thick mist on 1 May, "Lord George V" slammed into the destroyer after the last crossed under the bow of the ship. "Punjabi" was cut in two amid the crash, and sank with overwhelming death toll. A few profundity charges were additionally touched off on the harmed stern of "Ruler George V" amid the mishap. "Lord George V" was fixed up at Seidisfjord, before cruising to Gladstone Dock, Liverpool, to get fixes. 

In December 1942, HMS "Lord George V" sent in help of Convoy JW 51A, the principal Russian escort to cruise direct from the United Kingdom ceaselessly at Iceland. The voyage was finished without occurrence. On accepting expression of the German maritime assault on Convoy JW 51B in what wound up known as the Battle of the Barents Sea, "Lord George V" was dispatched alongside nine different boats from Scapa Flow on 31 December to give spread to the returning Convoy RA 51 and to endeavor to get the German boats occupied with the past attack. The German boats were at last not experienced, and RA 51 was returned securely. "Lord George V" later gave a covering power to two further guards amid mid 1943, preceding being exchanged to the Mediterranean amid May in anticipation of Operation Husky, the Allied intrusion of Sicily. Elevated to leader on 30 June 1943, McNicoll partook in the Sicilian attack the next month, with "Lord George V" filling in as a feature of the covering power. Preceding the intrusion, "Lord George V", alongside , had executed a barrage of Trapani and the islands of Favignana and Levanzo the evening of 11/12 July, as a major aspect of a misdirection recommending arrivals on the west shore of Sicily. 

McNicoll was quickly reposted to HMS "Triumph" on 1 September 1943, preceding being exchanged for staff obligations with the Admiralty in London the next month. He finished a year-long connection with the Admiralty, and was engaged with the getting ready for the Normandy arrivals.

Up to this period, McNicoll had finished everything except five of his long stretches of military administration connected to the Royal Navy. McNicoll's three siblings additionally served in the Second World War: Ronald Ramsay, who at last resigned with the position of significant general and served in the Korean War, as a colonel with the Royal Australian Engineers; Frederick Oscar Ramsay as a lieutenant in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN); and David Ramsayâwho might turn into a cultivated writerâas a lieutenant in the seventh Division up to 1944, preceding spending the rest of the contention as a war journalist for Consolidated Press, in which limit he secured the Normandy arrivals. 

McNicoll was selected official officer of the light cruiser on 16 September 1945, a fortnight after the end of threats in the Pacific theater. From November 1945 until July 1947, "Hobart" went through nine months working in Japanese waters more than three particular periods as a component of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The ship was put for possible later use from December 1947, and McNicoll quickly exchanged to HMAS "Penguin" before expecting the post of Director of Plans and Operations at the Navy Office in Melbourne on 6 January 1948. Progressed to chief in June 1949, he was presented two months after the fact on , a River-class frigate, as the ship's boss, and was all the while set responsible for the first Frigate Squadron. He was selected a privileged confidant to the Governor-General of Australia in December for a time of three years.

Amid McNicoll's residency as leader of "Warramunga", the ship worked in Australian waters as a component of the Australia Station, cruising to New Zealand for a visit amid March 1950. On the flare-up of the Korean War in June that year, "Warramunga" was chosen as a component of the Australian commitment to the contention. Also, the ship was to be joined to a power of five Royal Navy destroyers driven by a chief, making it practical to have the Australian ship told by an officer of lower rank; McNicoll was subsequently supplanted by Commander Otto Becher on 28 July. McNicoll was then presented on the Navy Office to aid the presentation and co-appointment of National Service in the Australian military because of the National Service Act 1951. He moved to the land base HMAS "Lonsdale" in October 1951, on being made Deputy Chief of Naval Staff. 

In 1952, McNicoll was named director of the arranging board of trustees for the British atomic tests on the Montebello Islands, off the shore of Western Australia. Soon thereafter, he was made leader of the overwhelming cruiser , a post he held for the following two years. As authority of "Australia", McNicoll likewise filled in as Chief Staff Officer to the Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet. HMAS "Australia" was close to the finish of its maritime administration and had been consigned to preparing obligations from 1950. In that capacity, the cruiser was principally relegated to Australian waters, however a concise excursion to New Zealand occurred in October 1953. McNicoll was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 New Year Honors List for his inclusion in the British nuclear program; he was given the improvement three months after the fact by Queen Elizabeth II in a service at Government House, Melbourne. 

The time of 1954 was to be HMAS "Australia's" rearward in administration, with the ship directing Royal and Vice Regal assignments as a portion of its last obligations. In February and March, HMAS "Australia" filled in as a major aspect of the escort for the Royal Yacht "Gothic" amid the Australian leg of Queen Elizabeth II's crowning ceremony visit. The cruiser was given the Gloucester Cup on 25 March as the ship "viewed as preeminent all in all proficiency, tidiness, seamanship and specialized preparing" amid the time of 1953. As one of the ship's last obligations with the Navy, "Australia" was entrusted with transporting Field Marshal Sir William Slim, the Governor-General of Australia, alongside his better half and their staff on a journey around the Coral Sea, the Great Barrier Reef and the Whitsunday Passage. The voyage left on 4 May, and after two days "Australia" shot its 8-inch weapons for the last time. While in the Coral Sea, a Dutch maritime ship was found to be weakened off the bank of Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea, and was thusly towed by "Australia" to Cairns. McNicoll was later named a Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau by the Dutch government for his salvage of the ship. 

McNicoll surrendered order of HMAS "Australia" in July 1954 preceding the cruiser was satisfied and set apart for transfer the next month, and he quickly came back to obligations at the Navy Office. In November, he left for London to go to the Imperial Defense College as a major aspect of the 1955 course admission, which implied that he had been set apart for senior direction. McNicoll and his significant other, Ruth, had isolated in 1950 and their separation, which refered to infidelity as the reason, was settled in October 1956, while the previous was still in London. On 17 May the next year, McNicoll marry Frances Mary Chadwick, a columnist, in the Hampstead register office. Made acting back naval commander in January 1957, McNicoll was selected as Head of the Australian Joint Service Staff in London. He came back to Australia in February 1958 and was chosen to fill in as Deputy Secretary (Military) at the Department of Defense; McNicoll's rank was made substantive in July that year. 

On 8 January 1960, McNicoll was presented on the Naval Board in Canberra as Second Naval Member and Chief of Personnel. As verified by antiquarian Ian Pfennigwerth, McNicoll held this situation at once in which enrollment and maintenance in the Navy especially falled behind targets. McNicoll was furthermore delegated as a trustee of the RAN Relief Trust Fund amid this period. Finishing his term on the Naval Board, McNicoll was posted as Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet on 8 January 1962 and lifted his standard on board , the lead of the RAN. The Australian government had assigned the job of the RAN to be fundamentally one of hostile to submarine fighting, a stance which McNicoll thought impulsive. McNicoll contended that surface and air weapons represented a risk equivalent to that of submarines toward vessels in present day maritime fighting. All things considered, he crusaded for a contemporary plane carrying warship to supplant that of HMAS "Melbourne". The Army and Air Force restricted McNicoll's position, and the administration eventually presumed that there was no vital necessity for another transporter in light of understandings contained in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. In any occasion, McNicoll encountered an especially requesting residency as Fleet Commander since the RAN was presently a total update of its request of fight and, as a result, he needed to deal with the presentation and organization into administration of six Ton-class minesweepers obtained from the Royal Navy, alongside the main group of Westland Wessex helicopters and modernized above water bolster capacities. Moreover, McNicoll was accused of the obligation of guaranteeing Australian maritime responsibilities to the Far East Strategic Reserve were met. 

McNicoll's two-year term as Fleet Commander finished up on 6 January 1964, so, all things considered he came back to the Naval Board as Fourth Naval Member and Chief of Supply. Notwithstanding, this post demonstrated brief with his arrangement as Flag Officer-in-Charge East Australia Area, headquartered at the land base HMAS "Kuttabul" in Sydney, from June that year. In the 1965 New Year Honors, McNicoll was designated a Companion of the Order of the Bath. 

On 24 February 1965, McNicoll was advanced bad habit naval commander and made Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) in progression to Vice Admiral Sir Hastings Harrington. By ideals of this position, McNicoll was leader of the Naval Board and the utilitarian administrator of the RAN. McNicoll's term as CNS was portrayed by a time of uplifted movement for the RAN in light of the Australian responsibilities to the Indonesiaâ Malaysia "Konfrontasi" and the Vietnam War. He moreover needed to administer a broad modernisation of the armada, with the presentation into administration of the "Perth"- class destroyers, "Assault"- class watch water crafts, and the underlying group of "Oberon"- class submarines. The Fleet Air Arm was likewise re-outfitted with American fixed wing air ship. Regardless of these acquisitions, the RAN had a fairly meager and constrained armada amid this period, which McNicoll accused on past maritime arranging. He reprimanded the absence of prescience in prior choices that had prompted "irregularities and insufficient evaluating" later on necessities of the RAN, which had therefore left the armada obsolete and negligible. Notwithstanding the RAN's materiel issues, McNicoll confronted noteworthy issues with spirit and enlistment. A progression of setbacks and mishaps over the earlier decade prompted what maritime student of history Tom Frame named as "an apparent disintegration of open trust in the naval force's proficient benchmarks". The circumstance increased after the February 1964 impact between HMAS "Melbourne" and "Voyager". The two consequent Royal Commissions into the occurrence exposed the RAN to exceptional examination and harmed the open view of its senior authority. McNicoll needed to adapt to the disturbance occasioned by these occasions and worried about the reclamation of confidence in the Navy. 

The residency of Air Chief Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger as Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee was set to lapse in May 1966, and a substitution must be chosen from the administration boss. The Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, had among barrier and military circles been thought to be the common successor. In any case, mounting hypothesis emerged from late 1965 over who was to be chosen for the situation as it progressed toward becoming known Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies favored McNicoll for the post, as did Secretary of the Department of Defense Sir Ted Hicks, who thought McNicoll more astute and target than his military partner. McNicoll campaigned fervently for the position, and was upheld by his significant other, Frances, who effectively crusaded for her better half's sake. By December 1965, Scherger's substitution had still not been settled on and Menzies deferred the choice until the new year. Be that as it may, Menzies resigned in January 1966 and was prevailing by his representative, Harold Holt. Holt and the recently designated Minister for Defense, Allen Fairhall, favored Wilton and eventually chosen him to succeed Scherger. In any occasion, McNicoll was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1966 New Year Honors for his administration as CNS. 

McNicoll was enthusiastic for a RAN commitment to the Vietnam War and, in July 1966, suggested that the four Australian minesweepers working out of Singapore be sent to Vietnamese waters since "Konfrontasi" was at an end and the vessels were never again fundamental around there. The thought was dismissed by Fairhall, be that as it may, who was aware of an up and coming race and was determined that nothing be chosen until a short time later. The likelihood of a maritime commitment to Vietnam was brought again up in December, and it was chosen that the guided rocket destroyer and a leeway jumping group of six work force be conveyed as the Royal Australian Navy Force Vietnam. Per an understanding among McNicoll and Admiral Roy L. Johnson, Commander of the United States Pacific Fleet, HMAS "Hobart" was to be joined to the United States Seventh Fleet and direct shore siege activities. The organization of an Australian destroyer to Vietnam wound up lasting, with the boats working on a six-month revolution. Agreeable to McNicoll, the RAN commitment to the performance center was additionally reinforced in 1967 with the development of the RAN Helicopter Flight Vietnam and the dispatch of maritime pilots to serve in an Army bolster job with No. 9 Squadron RAAF. 

The obvious inheritance of McNicoll's administration as CNS is the Australian White Ensign. The British White Ensign had been flown by Australian vessels since the arrangement of the RAN in 1911, yet the Australian commitment to Vietnamâa contention in which the United Kingdom was not includedâserved to confuse the circumstance. Government legislator Sam Benson scrutinized the Australian utilization of the British ensign before parliament in October 1965, and McNicoll later raised the issue with the Naval Board. The Naval Board at last chose to prescribe to the legislature that the RAN make its own one of a kind white ensign. A structure went with the proposal, which depicted the ensign as a "white banner with the Union Flag in the upper canton at the lift with six blue stars situated as in the Australian banner". The administration endorsed the proposition, and the Australian White Ensign was formally presented all through the RAN on 1 March 1967. 

Following 46 years of administration, McNicoll resigned from the RAN on 2 April 1968 and was prevailing as CNS by Vice Admiral Victor Smith. In the number one spot up to his retirement, McNicoll finished a goodbye visit by visiting a few boats and maritime foundations all through Australia. The excursion finished with a fourteen day visit to Vietnam, and McNicoll was available in Saigon when the city was assaulted by Viet Cong powers as a feature of the Tet Offensive. As a man who "loved activity", McNicoll later expressed that he got an "incredible rush" amid the strike as he anticipated transportation back to Australia. 

On his retirement from the Navy, McNicoll was selected by the Australian government as its debut diplomat to Turkey. He had the capacity to shape obliging relations between the legislatures of Australia and Turkey, in spite of the physical and calculated issues related with the foundation of another government office and the absence of learning the two countries had of each other. McNicoll held his conciliatory post in Ankara for a long time, before he came back to Australia in 1973 and resigned to Canberra. A man of "culture and refined scholarly tastes", McNicoll drew in his enthusiasm for expressions of the human experience amid retirement and in 1979 distributed his interpretation of "The Odes of Horace". He was likewise a music darling and a sharp fly-angler. 

Sir Alan McNicoll kicked the bucket on 11 October 1987 at 79 years old. Recognized as an "all around educated, persevering and gifted head", he was incinerated with full maritime distinctions. McNicoll was made due by his significant other, and by the youngsters from his first marriage.
