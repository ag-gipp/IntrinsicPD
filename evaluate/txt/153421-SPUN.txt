Similitudes between the two amusements and their topics was a typical abstain among analysts. 

Commentators scrutinized or had little acclaim for the diversion's accentuation on gathering things and backtracking"an intelligent egg chase". This had turned into a pattern in the designer's recreations, and "Jackass Kong 64" pursued the "anticipated recipe" of making players gather various arrangements of things and those sets in full for an uncommon closure. "People to come" additionally observed the engineer making a propensity for backtracking in their diversions. "GameSpot" was progressively strategic: the individuals who enjoyed gathering things would be titillated by its replay esteem, and the individuals who did not would be baffled by its errands. The riddles and minigames are fun the first run through, as indicated by "EGM", however they rapidly turned out to be worn when replayed with progressively more tightly time confinements. "GameSpot", be that as it may, considered pieces of "Jackass Kong 64" ongoing interaction "cerebral", requiring the player to think about a few concurrent errands to fathom later riddles.

Analysts noticed the diversion's size and length. With an expected 30 hours in essential ongoing interaction, "IGN" considered it Rare's "War and Peace". "Enormous" is putting it mildly, expressed "GameFan", "the experience found inside is mastodonic". Commentators turned out to be as often as possible lost or occupied in its reality. Pundits featured the creativity of the manager fights, especially the last fight against K. Rool, however the story's completion frustrated "EGM". Faultfinders discovered little diversion in the multiplayer mode yet lauded the interactivity assortment between the five characters. The controls additionally disappointed analysts, between moderate development speed and camera point issues. For instance, characters who become inert to control amid their assault activitys are powerless against infringing foes. "Edge" composed that the absence of camera enhancements over "Banjo-Kazooie" was reprehensible. 

Regardless of its extended memory assets, analysts felt that "Jackass Kong 64" visuals were just marginallyif at allbetter than that of its contemporary amusements, for example, the earlier year's "Banjo-Kazooie".

The setting is infertile and uninspiring at solitary later presents lighting impacts and more extravagant surfaces. "IGN" sought after additional from Rare, and keeping in mind that its analyst adulated the diversion's molecule impacts (e.g., in the desert wind), he considered its dynamic lighting abused. "N64 Magazine" said that the upgraded impacts were frequently utilized for embellishment, however they likewise assumed some job in riddles dependent on lighting up ways. Commentators noted graphical challenges even with the additional memory, for example, outline rate log jams and inaccessible highlights not showing up in any detail, however by and large they considered the additional graphical twists admirable. "GameSpot" additionally observed an absence of assortment in the amusement's condition. 

The characters have Rare's significant funniness, and analysts commended their individual identities. A few analysts noticed how much the character identities appeared in their movements. "IGN" considered "Jackass Kong 64" characters less astounding than those of other Rare titles, and here and there entertaining. "GameFan" found that the expansion of the three new playable characters to the arrangement offered little identity that would be missed. 

While "IGN" felt that the amusement's music was less cunning than "Banjo-Kazooie", Kirkhope's soundtrack still conveyed an assortment of states of mind and fit the setting. Aural hints in the encompass sound and the nature of the submerged impacts inspired "GameSpot".

After eight years, "Nintendo Life" said the melody was "adored by a few, hated by others", like the diversion itself. 

Commentators reasoned that "Jackass Kong 64" came up short on the progressive capability of "Jackass Kong Country" however was of an adequate high caliber to sell well amid the Christmas season. "The 3D stage classification doesn't develop with "Jackass Kong 64"", "AllGame" composed. While advertised fans would be disillusioned, "IGN" felt that "Jackass Kong 64" remains a brilliant and far reaching platformer with a mind-boggling measure of activities. "GameFan", then again, was most frustrated by how the amusement "genuinely offers just the same old thing new" and contrasted its repetitiveness and redundancy and the film "Eyes Wide Shut": "a major enlarged venture with insufficient splendid minutes to legitimize the deadness ... [of] sitting through the entire thing", it "neglects to satisfy the Rare name". "Jackass Kong 64" 3D platforming was ordinary when of its discharge and, as per "GameSpot", would have fared better as a Nintendo 64 dispatch title.

By and by, the 3D "Jackass Kong" was "a fine exertion ... in its very own right". 

Uncommon's 3D platformers wound up famous for their accentuation on gathering things, and "Kotaku" recalled "Jackass Kong 64" as "the most exceedingly terrible guilty party" with many shading coded bananas. Other review analysts concurred. "As ... "Super Mario 64" revived the 3D platforming kind", "Electronic Gaming Monthly" composed, ""Donkey Kong 64" sucked it full scale" and set Rare's notoriety for making "gather a-thon" recreations. The independent designer behind "A Hat in Time", an otherworldly successor to "Banjo-Kazooie", accused "Jackass Kong 64" for the "gather a-thon stage explorer" sort's decrease in notoriety. 

"Retro Gamer" and "Amusement Informer" both recalled the diversion's gathering as "blended", regarding its similitudes with "Banjo-Kazooie" and absence of kind pushing changes. Notwithstanding average audits, "Jackass Kong 64" and Rare's consequent Nintendo 64 discharges did not meet the extolment of the organization's previous amusements, and dreary deals prompted a staff mass migration that finished with the organization's procurement by Microsoft in 2002. The Nintendo 64 was moving toward the finish of its lifecycle, "Electronic Gaming Monthly" noted at the amusement's dispatch, as gamers turned their sights to the Sega Dreamcast and Sony PlayStation 2. "IGN" later named "Jackass Kong 64" as deserving of being changed for Nintendo's 3DS handheld reassure. 

The DK Rap is associated with its negative gathering. Versions of the tune later showed up in "Super Smash Bros. Skirmish" and "Jackass Konga".
