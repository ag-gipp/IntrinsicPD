Satyajit Ray 

Satyajit Ray (; 2 May 1921Â â 23 April 1992) was an Indian movie producer, screenwriter, music writer, visual craftsman, lyricist and writer, broadly viewed as one of the best producers of the twentieth century. Beam was conceived in Calcutta into a Bengali Kayastha family which was conspicuous in the field of expressions and writing. Beginning his profession as a business craftsman, Ray was drawn into autonomous filmmaking in the wake of meeting French movie producer Jean Renoir and survey Vittorio De Sica's Italian neorealist film "Bike Thieves" (1948) amid a visit to London. 

Beam coordinated 36 films, including highlight movies, documentaries and shorts. He was additionally a fiction author, distributer, artist, calligrapher, music writer, visual architect and film commentator. He composed a few short stories and books, implied fundamentally for youthful youngsters and adolescents. Feluda, the sleuth, and Professor Shonku, the researcher in his sci-fi stories, are well known anecdotal characters made by him. He was granted a privileged degree by Oxford University. 

Beam's first film, "Pather Panchali" (1955), won eleven universal prizes, including the debut Best Human Document grant at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. This film, alongside "Aparajito" (1956) and "Apur Sansar" ("The World of Apu") (1959), structure "The Apu Trilogy". Beam did the scripting, throwing, scoring, and altering, and planned his very own credit titles and exposure material. Beam got many real honors in his profession, including 32 Indian National Film Awards, a Golden Lion, a Golden Bear, 2 Silver Bears, some of extra honors at universal film celebrations and grant services, and an Academy Honorary Award in 1992. The Government of India respected him with the Bharat Ratna, its most noteworthy regular citizen grant, in 1992. Beam had gotten numerous noticible honors and picked up an esteemed position over his life time. 

In 2004, Ray was positioned number 13 in BBC's survey of the Greatest Bengali ever. 

Satyajit Ray's family line can be followed back for somewhere around ten ages. Beam's granddad, Upendrakishore Ray was an author, artist, scholar, distributer, beginner space expert and a pioneer of the Brahmo Samaj, a religious and social development in nineteenth century Bengal. He additionally set up a printing press by the name of U. Beam and Sons, which framed an essential background to Satyajit's life. Sukumar Ray, Upendrakishore's child and father of Satyajit, was a spearheading Bengali author of hogwash rhyme (Abol tabol) and kids' writing, an artist and a faultfinder. Beam was destined to Sukumar and Suprabha Ray in Calcutta. 

Satyajit Ray's family had procured the name 'Ray'(originally 'Rai') from the Mughals. 

In spite of the fact that they were Bengali Kayasthas, the Rays were 'Vaishnavas' (admirers of Vishnu) as against larger part Bengali Kayasthas who were 'Shaktos' (admirers of the Shakti) . 

Sukumar Ray kicked the bucket when Satyajit was scarcely three, and the family made due on Suprabha Ray's pitiful salary. Beam learned at Ballygunge Government High School, Calcutta, and finished his BA in financial aspects at Presidency College, Calcutta at that point subsidiary with the University of Calcutta,(now Kolkata)though his advantage was dependably in expressive arts. In 1940, his mom demanded that he learned at the Visva-Bharati University at Santiniketan, established by Rabindranath Tagore. Beam was hesitant because of his adoration for Calcutta, and the low supposition of the scholarly life at Santiniketan. His mom's influence and his regard for Tagore at last persuaded him to attempt. In Santiniketan, Ray came to acknowledge Oriental workmanship. He later conceded that he gained much from the popular painters Nandalal Bose and Benode Behari Mukherjee. Later he created a narrative film, "The Inner Eye," about Mukherjee. His visits to Ajanta, Ellora and Elephanta invigorated his reverence for Indian workmanship. 

In 1943, Ray began work at D.J. Keymer, a British-run promoting office, as a "lesser visualiser," winning eighty rupees every month. In spite of the fact that he loved visual structure (visual communication) and he was generally treated well, there was strain between the British and Indian representatives of the firm. The British were better paid, and Ray felt that "the customers were commonly dumb." Later, Ray additionally worked for Signet Press, another distributing house begun by D. K. Gupta. Gupta approached Ray to make spread plans for books to be distributed by Signet Press and gave him complete aesthetic opportunity. Beam planned spreads for some, books, including Jibanananda Das' "Banalata Sen", and "Rupasi Bangla", Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's "Chander Pahar", Jim Corbett's "Maneaters of Kumaon," and Jawaharlal Nehru's "Disclosure of India." He chipped away at a kids' adaptation of "Pather Panchali," an exemplary Bengali tale by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, renamed as "Aam Antir Bhepu" ("The mango-seed whistle"). Structuring the spread and representing the book, Ray was profoundly affected by the work. He utilized it as the subject of his first film, and highlighted his representations as shots in his noteworthy film. 

Alongside Chidananda Dasgupta and others, Ray established the Calcutta Film Society in 1947. They screened numerous remote movies, a considerable lot of which Ray viewed and truly examined. He got to know the American GIs positioned in Calcutta amid World War II, who kept him educated about the most recent American movies appearing in the city. He came to know a RAF representative, Norman Clare, who shared Ray's enthusiasm for movies, chess and western established music. 

In 1949, Ray wedded Bijoya Das, his first cousin and long-term sweetheart. The couple had a child, Sandip, who is currently a movie executive. Around the same time, French executive Jean Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film "The River". Beam helped him to discover areas in the field. Beam informed Renoir concerning his concept of recording "Pather Panchali", which had for quite some time been at the forefront of his thoughts, and Renoir empowered him in the venture. In 1950, D.J. Keymer sent Ray to London to work at its home office. Amid his three months in London, Ray watched 99 films. Among these was the neorealist film "Ladri di biciclette" ("Bicycle Thieves") (1948) by Vittorio De Sica, which profoundly affected him. Beam later said that he left the auditorium resolved to turn into a movie producer. 

Beam chose to utilize "Pather Panchali" (1928), the great "Bildungsroman" of Bengali writing, as the reason for his first film. The semi-personal novel depicts the development of Apu, a little kid in a Bengal town. 

Beam accumulated an unpracticed group, albeit the two his cameraman Subrata Mitra and craftsmanship executive Bansi Chandragupta proceeded to accomplish extraordinary recognition. The cast comprised of generally novice performing artists. He began shooting in late 1952 with his own reserve funds and would have liked to collect more cash once he had a few sections shot, however did not prevail on his terms. Subsequently, Ray shot "Pather Panchali" more than three years, a strangely extensive stretch, in view of when he or his creation chief Anil Chowdhury could raise extra assets. He rejected financing from sources who needed an adjustment in content or supervision over generation. He additionally disregarded exhortation from the administration to join a cheerful consummation, however he received financing that enabled him to finish the film. Beam demonstrated an early movie section to the American executive John Huston, who was in India exploring areas for "The Man Who Would Be King". The entry was of the vision which Apu and his sister have of the train going through the field, the main arrangement which Ray had yet shot because of his little spending plan. Huston informed Monroe Wheeler at the New York Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) that a noteworthy ability was seemingly within easy reach. 

With a credit from the West Bengal government, Ray at long last finished the film. It was discharged in 1955 to extraordinary basic and mainstream achievement. It earned various prizes and had long keeps running in the two India and abroad. In India, the response to the film was excited; "The Times of India" composed that "It is preposterous to contrast it and some other Indian film [...] "Pather Panchali" is unadulterated film." In the United Kingdom, Lindsay Anderson composed a gleaming survey of the film. In any case, the response was not consistently positive. In the wake of viewing the motion picture, FranÃ§ois Truffaut is accounted for to have stated, "I would prefer not to see a motion picture of laborers eating with their hands." Bosley Crowther, at that point the most powerful pundit of "The New York Times", composed a searing survey of the film. Its American merchant Ed Harrison was stressed Crowther's survey would deter groups of onlookers, yet the film had a particularly long run when discharged in the United States. A film still utilized on the first notice for the motion picture included in "The Family of Man", the Museum of Modern Art display that was seen by 9 million guests. It is a low-edge shot of the legend Apu having his hair brushed by his sister Durga and revering mother Sarbojaya. Of the thirteen pictures the presentation portraying India it was the just a single made by an Indian picture taker. Keeper Edward Steichen attributed it to Ray, but since Ray was not known to be a picture taker, it is likely the creator of this photo, of a scene coordinated by Ray, was the film's cinematographer, Subrata Mitra. 

Beam's global profession began vigorously after the accomplishment of his next film, "Aparajito" ("The Unvanquished"). This film demonstrates the unceasing battle between the aspirations of a young fellow, Apu, and the mother who cherishes him. Pundits, for example, Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak rank it higher than Ray's first film. "Aparajito" won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, bringing Ray impressive praise. Before finishing "The Apu Trilogy", Ray coordinated and discharged two different movies: the comic "Parash Pathar" ("The Philosopher's Stone"), and "Jalsaghar" ("The Music Room"), a film about the debauchery of the Zamindars, thought about a standout amongst his most critical works. 

While making "Aparajito", Ray had not arranged a set of three, yet after he was gotten some information about the thought in Venice, it engaged him. He completed the remainder of the set of three, "Apur Sansar" ("The World of Apu") in 1959. Pundits Robin Wood and Aparna Sen observed this to be the preeminent accomplishment of the set of three. Beam presented two of his most loved performers, Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore, in this film. It opens with Apu living in a Calcutta house in close destitution. He winds up associated with a strange marriage with Aparna. An amazing scenes together structure "one of the film's exemplary confirmed delineations of wedded life." They endure disaster. After "Apur Sansar" was brutally censured by a Bengali pundit, Ray composed an article protecting it. He infrequently reacted to pundits amid his filmmaking profession, yet in addition later guarded his film "Charulata", his undisputed top choice. 

Beam composed his journals amid his shooting of the Apu Trilogy which has been distributed as . 

Beam's film triumphs had little impact on his own life in the years to come. He kept on living with his better half and kids in a leased house, with his mom, uncle and different individuals from his more distant family. 

Amid this period, Ray made movies on the British Raj time frame, (for example, "Devi"), a narrative on Tagore, a comic film ("Mahapurush") and his first film from a unique screenplay ("Kanchenjungha"). He likewise made a progression of movies that, taken together, are considered by commentators among the most profoundly felt depictions of Indian ladies on screen. 

Beam pursued "Apur Sansar" with "Devi" ("The Goddess"), a film in which he inspected the superstitions in Hindu society. Sharmila Tagore featured as Doyamoyee, a youthful spouse who is idolized by her dad in-law. Beam was stressed that the blue pencil board may hinder his film, or if nothing else make him re-cut it, however "Devi" was saved. In 1961, on the request of Prime priest Jawaharlal Nehru, Ray was authorized to make a narrative on Rabindranath Tagore, on the event of the writer's introduction to the world centennial, a tribute to the individual who likely most impacted Ray. Because of constrained film of Tagore, Ray confronted the test of making a film out of for the most part static material. He said that it took as much work as three element films. 

Around the same time, together with Subhas Mukhopadhyay and others, Ray had the capacity to restore "Sandesh", the kids' magazine which his granddad once distributed. Beam had been setting aside extra cash for certain years to make this conceivable. A duality in the name ("Sandesh" signifies both "news" in Bengali and furthermore a sweet well known treat) set the tone of the magazine (both instructive and engaging). Beam started to make delineations for it, just as to compose stories and articles for youngsters. Composing turned into his real wellspring of pay. 

In 1962, Ray coordinated "Kanchenjungha." Based on his first unique screenplay, it was his first film in shading. The film recounts a privileged family spending an evening in Darjeeling, a beautiful slope town in West Bengal. They endeavor to mastermind the commitment of their most youthful little girl to a generously compensated designer instructed in London. He had first imagined shooting the film in an expansive chateau, however later chose to film it in the renowned slope town. He utilized the numerous shades of light and fog to mirror the pressure in the show. Beam noticed that while his content enabled shooting to be conceivable under any lighting conditions, a business film unforeseen present in the meantime in Darjeeling neglected to shoot a solitary scene, as they just needed to do as such in daylight. 

In the sixties, Ray visited Japan and enjoyed specific gathering the movie producer Akira Kurosawa, for whom he had high respect. While at home, he would enjoy an intermittent reprieve from the tumultuous city life by going to spots, for example, Darjeeling or Puri to finish a content in disconnection. 

In 1964 Ray made "Charulata" ("The Lonely Wife"); it was the finish of this time of work, and viewed by numerous commentators as his most cultivated film. In light of "Nastanirh", a short story of Tagore, the film recounts a desolate spouse, Charu, in nineteenth century Bengal, and her developing affections for her brother by marriage Amal. Pundits have alluded to this as Ray's Mozartian artful culmination. He said the film contained the least defects among his work, and it was his solitary work which, given an opportunity, he would make the very same way. "Charulata" won him the Best Director prize at the Berlin Film Festival. Madhabi Mukherjee's execution as Charu, and crafted by both Subrata Mitra and Bansi Chandragupta in the film, have been exceedingly adulated. Different movies in this period incorporate "Mahanagar" ("The Big City"), "High schooler Kanya" ("Three Daughters"), "Abhijan" ("The Expedition"), "Kapurush" ("The Coward") and "Mahapurush" ("Holy Man"). 

In the post-"Charulata" period, Ray took on tasks of expanding assortment, going from dream to sci-fi to criminologist movies to recorded show. Beam likewise made impressive formal experimentation amid this period. He communicated contemporary issues of Indian life, reacting to an apparent absence of these issues in his movies. The primary significant film in this period is "Nayak" ("The Hero"), the tale of a screen legend going in a train and meeting a youthful, thoughtful female columnist. Featuring Uttam Kumar and Sharmila Tagore, in the twenty-four hours of the voyage, the film investigates the internal clash of the evidently exceptionally fruitful matinÃ©e symbol. Disregarding the film's accepting a "Pundits prize" at the Berlin International Film Festival, it had a by and large quieted gathering. 

In 1967, Ray composed a content for a film to be designated "The Alien", in view of his short story "Bankubabur Bandhu" ("Banku Babu's Friend"), which he wrote in 1962 for "Sandesh", the Ray family magazine. Columbia Pictures was the maker for what was an arranged US-India co-generation, and Marlon Brando and Peter Sellers were given a role as the main on-screen characters. Beam found that his content had been copyrighted and the expense appropriated by Michael Wilson. Wilson had at first moved toward Ray through their common companion, Arthur C. Clarke, to speak to him in Hollywood. Wilson copyrighted the content credited to "Mike Wilson and Satyajit Ray", despite the fact that he contributed just a single word. Beam later said that he never got a penny for the content. After Brando dropped out of the task, the undertaking attempted to supplant him with James Coburn, however Ray ended up frustrated and came back to Calcutta. Columbia communicated enthusiasm for restoring the undertaking a few times during the 1980s, however nothing happened to it. Whenever "E.T." was discharged in 1982, Clarke and Ray saw similitudes in the film to his prior "Outsider" content. Beam guaranteed that this film counterfeited his content. Beam said that Steven Spielberg's motion picture "would not have been conceivable without my content of 'The Alien' being accessible all through America in mimeographed duplicates." Spielberg denied any written falsification by saying, "I was a child in secondary school when this content was circling in Hollywood." (Spielberg really graduated secondary school in 1965 and discharged his first film in 1968). Other than "The Alien", two other unrealised undertakings that Ray had planned to coordinate were adjustments of the antiquated Indian epic, the "MahÄbhÄrata", and E. M. Forster's 1924 novel "A Passage to India". 

In 1969, Ray discharged what might be financially the best of his movies. In view of a youngsters' story composed by his granddad, "Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne" ("The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha"), it is a melodic dream. Goopy the vocalist and Bagha the drummer, supplied with three presents by the King of Ghosts, set out on an awesome adventure. They endeavor to stop a looming war between two neighboring kingdoms. Among his most costly endeavors, the film venture was hard to back. Beam relinquished his longing to shoot it in shading, as he turned down an offer that would have constrained him to cast a specific Hindi film performing artist as the lead. 

Beam made a film from a novel by the youthful artist and essayist, Sunil Gangopadhyay. Highlighting a melodic theme structure acclaimed as more perplexing than "Charulata", "Aranyer Din Ratri" ("Days and Nights in the Forest") follows four urban young fellows heading off to the woodlands for a get-away. They endeavor to desert their day by day lives. Everything except one of them become engaged with experiences with ladies, which turns into a profound investigation of the Indian white collar class. As indicated by Robin Wood, "a solitary succession [of the film] ... would offer material for a short article". 

After "Aranyer", Ray tended to contemporary Bengali life. He finished what ended up known as the "Calcutta set of three": "Pratidwandi" (1970), "Seemabaddha" (1971), and "Jana Aranya" (1975), three movies that were considered independently however had topical associations. "Pratidwandi" ("The Adversary") is around a dreamer youthful alumni; whenever disappointed toward the finish of film, he is as yet uncorrupted. "Jana Aranya" ("The Middleman") demonstrated a young fellow yielding to the way of life of defilement to bring home the bacon. "Seemabaddha" ("Company Limited") depicted an effectively fruitful man surrendering his ethical quality for further gains. In the primary film, "Pratidwandi", Ray presents another, circular account style, for example, scenes in negative, dream successions, and unexpected flashbacks. During the 1970s, Ray adjusted two of his well known stories as analyst films. Despite the fact that fundamentally routed to youngsters and youthful grown-ups, both "Sonar Kella" ("The Golden Fortress") and "Joi Baba Felunath" ("The Elephant God") discovered some basic after. 

Beam considered making a film on the Bangladesh Liberation War however later relinquished the thought. He said that, as a movie producer, he was progressively keen on the travails of the evacuees and not the governmental issues. In 1977, Ray finished "Shatranj Ke Khilari" ("The Chess Players"), a Hindi/Urdu film dependent on a short story by Munshi Premchand. It was set in Lucknow in the province of Oudh, a year prior to the Indian insubordination of 1857. A critique on issues identified with the colonization of India by the British, this was Ray's first element film in a language other than Bengali. It is his most costly and ritzy film, highlighting Sanjeev Kumar, Saeed Jaffrey, Amjad Khan, Shabana Azmi, Victor Bannerjee and Richard Attenborough. 

In 1980, Ray made a spin-off of "Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne", a to some degree political "Hirak Rajar Deshe" ("Kingdom of Diamonds"). The kingdom of the malicious Diamond King, or "Hirok Raj," is a suggestion to India amid Indira Gandhi's crisis period. Alongside his acclaimed short film "Pikoo" ("Pikoo's Diary") and hour-long Hindi film, "Sadgati," this was the finish of his work in this period. 

In 1983, while chipping away at "Ghare Baire" ("Home and the World"), Ray endured a heart assault; it would seriously restrain his profitability in the rest of the 9 years of his life. "Ghare Baire" was finished in 1984 with the assistance of Ray's child (who worked the camera from that point on) due to his wellbeing condition. He had needed to film this Tagore tale on the threats of intense patriotism for quite a while, and composed a first draft of a content for it during the 1940s. Despite unpleasant fixes because of Ray's ailment, the film received some basic approval. It had the primary kiss completely depicted in Ray's movies. In 1987, he made a narrative on his dad, Sukumar Ray. 

Beam's last three movies, made after his recuperation and with therapeutic strictures set up, were shot for the most part inside, and have an unmistakable style. They have more exchange than his prior movies and are regularly viewed as substandard compared to his before group of work. The first, "Ganashatru" ("An Enemy of the People") is an adjustment of the Ibsen play, and considered the weakest of the three. Beam recouped a portion of his structure in his 1990 film "Shakha Proshakha" ("Branches of the Tree"). In it, an elderly person, who has carried on with an actual existence of trustworthiness, comes to learn of the debasement of three of his children. The last scene demonstrates the dad discovering comfort just in the brotherhood of his fourth child, who is uncorrupted however rationally sick. Beam's last film, "Agantuk" ("The Stranger"), is lighter in state of mind however not in subject. At the point when a missing uncle lands to visit his niece in Calcutta, he stirs doubt as to his thought process. This incites far-running inquiries in the film about civilisation. 

In 1992, Ray's wellbeing weakened because of heart complexities. He was admitted to a medical clinic, however never recouped. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences granted him an Honorary Academy Award. Beam is the first and the main Indian, yet, to get the respect. Twenty-four days before his passing, Ray acknowledged the honor in a gravely sick condition, considering it the "Best accomplishment of [his] motion picture making profession." He kicked the bucket on 23 April 1992. 

Satyajit Ray considered content composition to be a necessary piece of course. At first he wouldn't make a film in any language other than Bengali. In his two non-Bengali component films, he composed the content in English; interpreters translated it in Hindi or Urdu under Ray's watch. Beam's eye for detail was coordinated by that of his specialty executive Bansi Chandragupta. His impact on the early movies was important to the point that Ray would dependably compose contents in English before making a Bengali variant, so that the non-Bengali Chandragupta would most likely perused it. The art of Subrata Mitra earned acclaim for the cinematography of Ray's movies. Various faultfinders imagined that his takeoff from Ray's team brought down the nature of cinematography in the accompanying movies. In spite of the fact that Ray transparently applauded Mitra, his determination in assuming control over task of the camera after "Charulata" made Mitra quit working for him after 1966. Mitra created "ricochet lighting", a method to reflect light from material to make a diffused, practical light even on a set. Beam recognized his obligations to Jean-Luc Godard and FranÃ§ois Truffaut of the French New Wave for presenting new specialized and true to life advancements. 

Beam's ordinary movie proofreader was Dulal Datta, however the chief generally managed the altering while Datta did the genuine work. In view of budgetary reasons and Ray's careful arranging, his movies were for the most part cut in-camera (aside from "Pather Panchali"). Toward the start of his vocation, Ray worked with Indian traditional artists, including Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan, and Ali Akbar Khan. He found that their first faithfulness was to melodic conventions, and not to his film. He had a more noteworthy comprehension of Western established structures, which he needed to use for his movies set in a urban milieu. Beginning with "Youngster Kanya", Ray started to form his own scores. 

He utilized on-screen characters of assorted foundations, from well known film stars to individuals who had never observed a film (as in "Aparajito"). Robin Wood and others have commended him as the best executive of youngsters, bringing up important exhibitions in the jobs of Apu and Durga ("Pather Panchali"), Ratan ("Postmaster") and Mukul ("Sonar Kella"). Contingent upon the ability or experience of the on-screen character, Ray shifted the force of his heading, from for all intents and purposes nothing with performing artists, for example, Utpal Dutt, to utilizing the performer as a manikin (Subir Banerjee as youthful Apu or Sharmila Tagore as Aparna). Performing artists who had worked for Ray commended his standard trust yet said he could likewise treat ineptitude with all out scorn. 

With brimming with profound respect of his realistic style and faultless specialty, British Film Academy Director Roger Manvell had stated, "In the limited style he has embraced, Ray has turned into an ace of system. He takes his planning from the idea of the general population and their condition; his camera is the purpose, subtle eyewitness of responses; his altering the circumspect, affordable change starting with one esteem then onto the next." 

In spite of the fact that an ace specialist and a great skilled worker, Ray constantly attributed life to be the best sort of motivation for a well known medium like film. In his own words, "For a well known medium, the best sort of motivation ought to get from life and have its underlying foundations in it. No measure of specialized clean can compensate for imitation of the topic and the untrustworthiness of treatment." 

Beam made two well known anecdotal characters in Bengali kids' writingâFeluda, an analyst, and Professor Shonku, a researcher. The Feluda stories are described by Topesh Ranjan Mitra otherwise known as Topse, his high school cousin, something of a Watson to Feluda's Holmes. The science fictions of Shonku are exhibited as a journal found after the researcher had bafflingly vanished. Beam additionally composed an accumulation of rubbish stanza named "Today Bandha Ghorar Dim," which incorporates an interpretation of Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky". He composed an accumulation of silly accounts of Mullah Nasiruddin in Bengali. 

His short stories were distributed as accumulations of 12 stories, in which the general title played with the word twelve (for instance "Aker pitthe dui", or truly "Two over one"). Beam's enthusiasm for riddles and plays on words is reflected in his accounts. Beam's short stories give full rein to his enthusiasm for the grotesque, in tension and different angles that he evaded in film, making for a fascinating mental examination. The greater part of his works have been converted into English. A large portion of his screenplays have been distributed in Bengali in the scholarly diary "Eksan". Beam composed a self-portrayal about his youth years, "Jakhan Choto Chilam" (1982), meant English as Childhood Days. 

Beam wrote his encounters amid the period when he shot the Apu Trilogy in his diaries titled . 

He likewise composed papers on film, distributed as the accumulations: "Our Films, Their Films" (1976), "Bishoy Chalachchitra" (1976), and "Ekei Bole Shooting" (1979). Amid the mid-1990s, Ray's film articles and a collection of short stories were additionally distributed in English in the West. "Our Films, Their Films" is a compilation of film analysis by Ray. The book contains articles and individual diary portions. The book is exhibited in two areas: Ray initially examines Indian film, before turning his consideration toward Hollywood, explicit movie producers (Charlie Chaplin and Akira Kurosawa), and developments, for example, Italian neorealism. His book "Bishoy Chalachchitra" was distributed in interpretation in 2006 as "Talking about Films". It contains a minimal portrayal of his rationality of various parts of the films. 

Satyajit Ray planned four typefaces for roman content named Ray Roman, Ray Bizarre, Daphnis, and Holiday content, aside from various Bengali ones for the "Sandesh" magazine. Beam Roman and Ray Bizarre won a global challenge in 1971. In specific circles of Calcutta, Ray kept on being known as a prominent visual architect, very much into his movie vocation. Beam showed every one of his books and planned spreads for them, just as making all attention material for his movies, i.e., Ray's aesthetic playing with the Bengali graphemes was likewise uncovered in the cine notices and cine promotion leaflets' spreads. He likewise structured fronts of a few books by different writers. In his calligraphic strategy there are profound effects of: 

(an) Artistic example of European melodic staff documentation in the graphemic syntagms; 

(b) alpana ("custom painting" basically rehearsed by Bengali ladies at the season of religious celebration; the term indicates 'to coat with'. For the most part classified as "People"- Art cf. in Ray's graphemes portrayals. 

Along these lines, purported division among established and society craftsmanship is obscured in Ray's portrayal of Bengali graphemes. The three-level X-tallness of Bengali graphemes was displayed so to speak map and the shapes, bends in the middle of even and vertical gathering point, pursue the examples of alpana. It is likewise seen that the transformation of graphemes (This may be assigned as "Archewriting") as a living item/subject in Ray's certain control of Bengali graphemes. 

Beam's work has been depicted as brimming with humanism and all inclusiveness, and of a beguiling effortlessness with profound hidden multifaceted nature. The Japanese executive Akira Kurosawa stated, "Not to have seen the film of Ray implies existing on the planet without seeing the sun or the moon." But his spoilers discover his movies frigidly moderate, moving like a "grand snail." Some discover his work hostile to present day; they condemn him for coming up short on the new methods of articulation or experimentation found in works of Ray's peers, for example, Jean-Luc Godard. As Stanley Kauffmann composed, a few faultfinders trust that Ray accept that watchers "can be keen on a film that basically stays in its characters, as opposed to one that forces sensational examples on their lives." Ray said he could do nothing about the moderate pace. Kurosawa shielded him by saying that Ray's movies were not moderate, "His work can be depicted as streaming composedly, similar to a major waterway". 

Pundits have regularly contrasted Ray with specialists in the film and other media, for example, Chekhov, Renoir, De Sica, Hawks or Mozart. The author V. S. Naipaul looked at a scene in "Shatranj Ki Khiladi" ("The Chess Players") to a Shakespearean play; he stated, "just three hundred words are verbally expressed yet goodness!Â â breathtaking things occur." Even commentators who disliked the style of Ray's movies by and large recognized his capacity to envelop an entire culture with every one of its subtleties. Beam's tribute in "The Independent" incorporated the inquiry, "Who else can contend?" His work was advanced in France by "The Studio des Ursuline" film. With loaded with positive adoration for a large portion of Ray's movies, commended film commentator Roger Ebert had refered to "Apu Triology" among the incredible motion pictures. 

Lauding his commitment to the universe of film, Martin Scorsese makes reference to: "His work is in the organization of that of living peers like Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa and Federico Fellini." 

Chief of works of art like "The Godafther" and "End of the world Now", Francis Ford Coppola refered to him (Ray) to be a noteworthy impact throughout everyday life. With profound expressions of acclaim for Ray's 1960 exemplary "Devi", what he had viewed as his best work and a "true to life achievement"; he further confessed to know about Indian film through Ray's works. 

As of late, on a visit to India, commended producer Christopher Nolan communicates his deference for Ray's first film, "Pather Panchali". Nolan communicated, "I have had the delight of watching [Satyajit] Ray's Pather Panchali as of late, which I hadn't seen previously. I think it is a standout amongst the best movies at any point made. It is an exceptional bit of work." 

Political ideologues disagreed with Ray's work. In an open discussion amid the 1960s, Ray and the Marxist producer Mrinal Sen occupied with a contention. Sen reprimanded him for throwing a matinÃ©e symbol, for example, Uttam Kumar, whom he thought about a trade off.
