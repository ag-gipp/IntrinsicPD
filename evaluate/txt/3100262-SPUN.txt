Leaving the Mediterranean, Waller came back to Australia in August 1941 for administration in the South West Pacific. On 24Â October, he took order of the light cruiser HMAS "Perth", berthed in Sydney.

Waller's activity contradicted the requests of his Dutch predominant, Admiral Conrad Helfrich, to "proceed with activity whatever the expense, and in any case", yet the Australian was persuaded that further commitment would mean futile penance. 

On the next night, 28Â February, "Perth" and "Houston" were endeavoring to get through the Sunda Strait to Australia when they experienced a Japanese attack armada escorted by four cruisers and twelve destroyers.

As per witnesses, Waller was most recently seen remaining on the scaffold after he had given the request to relinquish deliver, "looking down at the quiet turrets". He was authoritatively recorded as absent, assumed slaughtered, and was made due by his better half and children. Naval commander Cunningham depicted Waller's misfortune as "an overwhelming hardship for the youthful Navy of Australia", and Rear Admiral James Goldrick in this manner called him "the extraordinary officer of his age".

The participants included John Waller, Michael Waller's significant other, and enduring crew members of HMAS "Perth". On 13Â March 2010, a dedication to Waller was revealed in the place where he grew up of Benalla. In April 2011, he was one of thirteen servicemenâeleven mariners and two fighters, including Teddy Sheean, Robert Rankin, and John Simpson Kirkpatrickânamed by the Australian government for thought as conceivable beneficiaries of the Victoria Cross for extraordinary valor in battle, under an audit by the Defense Honors and Awards Appeals Tribunal; no RAN part had ever been granted the enhancement. Finishing up its examinations in February 2013, the court suggested that no further honor be made to any of the thirteen servicemen, yet that the name "Waller" (among others) should keep on being utilized for RAN sends after the present conveyor was decommissioned.
