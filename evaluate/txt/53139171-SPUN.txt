Dream Book 

Dream Book is an outdated semi-proficient American sci-fi magazine that distributed eight issues somewhere in the range of 1947 and 1951. The proofreader was William Crawford, and the distributer was Crawford's Fantasy Publishing Company, Inc. Crawford had issues disseminating the magazine, and his spending restricted the nature of the paper he could manage the cost of and the work of art he had the capacity to purchase, however he pulled in entries from some notable journalists, including Isaac Asimov, Frederik Pohl, A. E. van Vogt, Robert Bloch, and L. Ron Hubbard. The best-realized story to show up in the magazine was Cordwainer Smith's first deal, "Scanners Live in Vain", which was later incorporated into the main Science Fiction Hall of Fame treasury, and is currently viewed as one of Smith's best works. Jack Gaughan, later an honor winning sci-fi craftsman, made his first expert deal to "Dream Book", for the spread representing Smith's story. 

The primary sci-fi (SF) magazine, "Astounding Stories", showed up in 1926, and by the mid-1930s SF mash magazines were a settled kind. In 1933, William Crawford, a Pennsylvania sci-fi fan, began "Irregular Stories", a semi-proficient SF magazine, and he pursued this with "Wonder Tales" in 1934. Neither of the magazines endured long or accomplished wide circulation, however he got stories from Clifford Simak, P. Schuyler Miller, and John Wyndham, every one of whom were set up essayists. After World War II, Crawford, at this point living in Los Angeles, established Fantasy Publishing Company, Inc., and in 1947 he propelled "Dream Book" in bedsheet group. The editorial manager was recorded as "Garret Ford"; this was a nom de plume Crawford and his better half, Margaret. Some extra publication work was finished by Forrest Ackerman. 

When the principal issue was imprinted in mid-1947, Crawford's merchant had left business, abandoning him with 1,000 duplicates close by. He endeavored to sell the issue through membership and put some available to be purchased by means of pro vendors. Crawford did not generally approach excellent paper, and he chose to deliver two renditions of the second issue: one on book-quality paper, evaluated at 35 pennies, and another on lower-quality paper, valued at 25 pennies, expected for magazine kiosk circulation, each highlighting distinctive spread work of art. The third and fourth issues were likewise delivered in two renditions with various spreads, and a similar value distinction. With the third issue, Crawford diminished the size to process, reporting, "The adjustment in size might be badly designed to certain gatherersâhowever it has turned into an issue of a little FB or "no" FB by any stretch of the imagination". 

The absence of a dependable wholesaler kept on being an issue; Crawford remarked in the fourth issue that he had still not acquired solid across the country appropriation for the magazine. The rest of the issues were all in condensation group, with the exception of issue 6, which shrank to a little summary size. The eighth and last issue showed up in January 1951. 

Crawford still had in stock stories he had gained for "Wonder Tales" over 10 years sooner, and "Individuals of the Crater" by Andre Norton (under the nom de plume North), which showed up in the primary issue, was one of these. There was likewise a story by A. E. van Vogt, "The Cataaaa", and Robert Bloch's "The Black Lotus", which had first showed up in 1935 in "Abnormal Stories". Crawford's spending restricted the nature of the craftsmanship he could gainâhe some of the time was unfit to pay for workmanshipâyet he figured out how to get Charles McNutt, later otherwise called Charles Beaumont, to contribute inside delineations to the primary issue. Wendy Bousfield, a sci-fi history specialist, depicts his work as "strikingly unique", and believes the principal issue to be the most aesthetically alluring of the entire run. 

The following two issues included covers by Lora Crozetti on the "de luxury" versions; sf student of history Mike Ashley believes both to be "horrifying", and Bousfield depicts them as "rough and deadened". Van Vogt showed up in the two issues, with "The Ship of Darkness" and "The Great Judge", and the second issue included the primary portion of "The Machine-God Laughs", by Festus Pragnell, which was serialized more than three issues. The fourth issue saw the start of another sequential: "Dark Goldfish", by John Taine (a nom de plume the mathematician Eric Temple Bell); it kept running for two issues. Bousfield depicts the two serials as "among the weakest stories "FB" distributed". A third sequential, "Adventure to Barkut", by Murray Leinster, started in the seventh issue and was left inadequate when the magazine stopped distribution. It in this manner showed up in full in "Frightening Stories" in 1952. 

L. Ron Hubbard, in a matter of seconds to turn into the author of Dianetics, the forerunner of Scientology, contributed "Skirmish of the Wizards" to issue 5, and the 6th issue saw two prominent stories. One was "The Little Man on the Subway", by Isaac Asimov and Frederik Pohl, under the alias "MacCreigh"; Asimov had changed Pohl's first draft and submitted it to John Campbell at "Obscure" in 1941, who had rejected it. The other was "Scanners Live in Vain", by Cordwainer Smith. This was a nom de plume Paul A. Linebarger, an educator of Asian legislative issues and a military counselor, who had composed the story, motivated by his insight into brain science, a few years prior; he attempted to pitch it to the main SF magazines amid the war, however had been rejected. The story was Smith's first deal, and is currently viewed as a work of artâSF faultfinder John Clute portrays it as "one of [Smith's] best works", Pohl said that "it is maybe the main motivation behind why ["Fantasy Book"] is recollected", 

SF commentators Malcolm Edwards and Peter Nicholls depict "Dream Book" as "for the most part an undistinguished and whimsical magazine", however Ashley remarks that little press magazines, for example, "Dream Book", by giving an outlet to stories that couldn't sell somewhere else, gave a significant support of the class. 

Every one of the eight issues of the "Dream Book" were distributed by Fantasy Publishing Company, Inc. (FPCI), of Los Angeles, and altered by "Garret Ford", a nom de plume William and Margaret Crawford. The initial two issues were in bedsheet group, and the rest of the issues in summary organization, aside from issue 6 which was a little overview. The initial two issues were 44 pages in length; the following two were 68 pages; issues 5 and 6 were 84 pages and 112 pages separately; the last two issues were both 82 pages. The cost was 25 pennies for all issues with the exception of the three "de luxury" variation versions of issues 2, 3, and 4, which were 35 pennies. 

Two treasurys were drawn for the most part or totally from the tales distributed in "Dream Book". In 1949, Crawford secretly altered "The Machine-God Laughs", which contained Pragnell's story and two additional accounts from "Dream Book". It was distributed by Griffin Publishing, which was possessed by Crawford. In 1953, Crawford's other distributing organization, FPCI, issued "Science and Sorcery", altered by "Garret Ford", the nom de plume by the Crawfords when they altered "Dream Book". It contained fifteen stories, nine of which had initially showed up in "Dream Book".
