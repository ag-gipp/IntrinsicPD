In spite of the fact that the generation was initially planned as another coordinated effort with Juan Carlos CalderÃ³n, that arrangement was rejected when CalderÃ³n was unfit to create melodies for the collection. Confronting another material due date in his account contract, at his supervisor's proposal Miguel picked bolero music for his next venture. Mexican vocalist musician Armando Manzanero was procured by WEA Latina to co-produce the collection with Miguel. Recording started in August 1991 at Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California, with Bebu Silvetti the arranger. 

On the collection Miguel covers twelve boleros, initially recorded from 1944 to 1986.

"Sentiment" is the third-top rated collection ever in Mexico, and the top of the line record in Argentina by a non-local craftsman.

Its prosperity urged Miguel to discharge three more bolero records: "Segundo Romance" (1994), "Sentiments" (1997) and "Mis Romances" (2001). 

Since Miguel marked with WEA Latina in 1986, his collections "Soy Como Quiero Ser" (1987), "Busca una Mujer" (1988), and "20 AÃ±os" (1990) have sold more than three million duplicates in total in Mexico. His initial accounts comprised of delicate shake and pop song tunes, which prompted Miguel turning into a high schooler icon. On 14 January 1991, WEA Latina declared another collection with long-term maker and author Juan Carlos CalderÃ³n, who created the three past records by Miguel. Needing to repeat the achievement of "20 AÃ±os", CalderÃ³n would make pop melodies and numbers and discover tracks for Miguel to cover in Spanish. Generation was booked to start in April, with Italian-and English-language studio collections to pursue. The record name was unconvinced by CalderÃ³n's pre-chosen melodies; he needed to compose more organizations, and generation stopped uncertainly. At last, he was unfit to make tunes for the collection. 

Miguel had an authoritative due date with his name to record new material, and thought about chronicle boleros (moderate numbers "invested with sentimental verses") in the wake of meeting Mexican artist musician Armando Manzanero amid a broadcast meet. The vocalist had performed boleros (counting structures recorded by Manzanero) amid his . At the proposal of supervisor Hugo LÃ³pez, and understanding that he could engage a more established group of onlookers, Miguel picked boleros for his next collection and WEA Latina procured Manzanero to assume control over its generation. Manzanero was energetic, trusting that Miguel's notoriety would acquaint the class with youthful audience members. On 25 October 1991, the collection's title was declared as a reverence to boleros; it was Miguel's first as a maker. 

Recording started on 24 August 1991, at Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California. Miguel and Manzanero delivered the collection, with Bebu Silvetti orchestrating the strings with extra commitments from 32 musician under the bearing of American director Ezra Kliger. On "Sentiment" Miguel covers twelve boleros (with each track being portrayed as affection numbers), which were chosen by Manzanero from five hundred tunes including his "Te ExtraÃ±o" and "No SÃ© TÃº". Seven of the twelve tracks were recorded by 13 September when creation was suspended the next day when Miguel was hospitalized with an infected appendix. The collection's arranged late-October discharge was delayed until 19 November and recording continued two weeks after Miguel was hospitalized.

In the wake of performing all through Latin America and the United States, he finished up the visit in Chile in December. Notwithstanding visiting, Miguel performed at the Seville Expo '92 in Spain. His set rundown comprised basically of tunes from his prior vocation and boleros from "Sentiment". In October 1992 WEA Latina discharged "AmÃ©rica and En Vivo", a live EP including another track ("America, America") and visit chronicles of "Contigo en la Distancia", "No SÃ© TÃº" and "Inolvidable". AllMusic gave the EP three stars out of five. 

AllMusic manager Janet Rosen gave "Sentiment" three stars out of five, saying that it "includes the typical smooth, very much made pop ear sweet from Luis Miguel, genuinely sung over strings and affable Latin rhythms". Be that as it may, she noticed that the tunes in the collection booklet and the absence of liner notes made it troublesome for audience members to comprehend what "to make of this introduction". Rosen closed, "It doesn't make a differenceâthe title of the discharge says everything." Achy Obejas of the "Chicago Tribune" gave the record four stars out of four, applauding Miguel's refusal "to get goofy, which gives the exertion unmistakably more honesty than might have been envisioned" and calling his interpretation of boleros "dynamic and genuine." Mark Holston checked on the collection decidedly in the magazine "AmÃ©ricas", adulating Miguel's vocals, the selection of melodies and Silvetti's courses of action: ""Romance" is a notice of the suffering nature of immortal music". "Sun-Sentinel" commentator John Lannert called "Sentiment" a "sublime accumulation of refreshed works of art" and complimented the craftsman for staying "genuinely near the string-loaded unique adaptations". 

At the 1992 "Announcement" Music Awards Miguel was the Top Pop Latin Artist and the Top Hot Latin Tracks Artist, and "Sentiment" was the Top Pop Latin Album. In Chile, "Sentiment" won the Laurel de Oro Award for best collection of the year. The vocalist was the Best Artist From a Non-English-Speaking Country at the Korean International Music Awards. At the 1993 Grammy Awards, "Sentiment" was designated for Best Latin Pop Album, which was granted to Jon Secada for his collection "Otro DÃ­a MÃ¡s Sin Verte". That year "Sentiment" was likewise named for Pop Album of the Year at the Lo Nuestro Awards, again losing to Secada for his self-titled collection. At the 1993 yearly Premios "Eres", Miguel won three honors: Best Album, Best Male Singer and Best Show (for his visit). The record was the Best International Album and Miguel won the Best International Artist of the Year at the 1993 Ronda de Venezuela grants. 

"Sentiment" was discharged universally on 19 November 1991, and sold more than 400,000 duplicates in its initial 10 days. In Mexico it was confirmed octuple platinum by the AsociaciÃ³n Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON) for transportation two million duplicates, the nation's unsurpassed third-smash hit collection (just Juan Gabriel and JosÃ© has sold more duplicates with "Recuerdos, Vol. II" and "20 Triunfadoras" individually). In the United States, "Sentiment" appeared at number ten on the "Bulletin" Latin Pop Albums outline for the seven day stretch of 14 December 1991, and achieved number one a month later. The record beat the outline for 32 continuous weeks when it was dislodged by Jon Secada's eponymous collection on the seven day stretch of 22 August 1992, finishing 1992 and 1993 as the smash hit Latin pop collection of the year in the nation. It was the primary record by a Spanish-talking craftsman to be confirmed gold in Brazil and Taiwan, and the main gold confirmation by a non-hybrid Latin craftsman in the United States (later ensured platinum in the U.S. by the RIAA for shipments of one million duplicates). In South America, "Sentiment" was affirmed platinum in Colombia and Venezuela, gold in Paraguay and twofold platinum in Peru. In Argentina the collection was affirmed 16Ã platinum for offers of over oneÂ million duplicates, the top of the line record by a non-Argentine craftsman. It got a precious stone honor from the Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers (CAPIF), and was affirmed fourfold platinum in Chile and twofold platinum in Spain. Starting at 2013, "Sentiment" had sold over sevenÂ million duplicates worldwide and is Miguel's top of the line record. 

"Sentiment" was attributed by music faultfinders to have recharged standard enthusiasm for bolero music. As per "Chicago Tribune" editorial manager Monica Eng, "Similarly as Harry Connick, Jr. re-advanced the hints of Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Mexican platinum-selling heartthrob Luis Miguel brought back a thankfulness for the music of Mexico's boleristas." In "The Wall Street Journal", Mary Talbot contrasted restored enthusiasm for boleros with the recovery of huge band and swing music in the Anglo-American market, recently ruled by shake music (which had caught bolero's ubiquity amid the 1960s). Elena Kellner of the "Los Angeles Times" noticed the collection's "acquainting old top choices with more youthful groups of onlookers" while Achy Obejas of the "Chicago Tribune" reported Miguel's fame with more seasoned audience members. In "Latin Beat Magazine", Franz Reynold composed that before Miguel, boleros were considered by youngsters the "music of the people of old, something to be dreaded, since it appeared to flag the approach of feebleness". Imprint Holston wrote in "AmÃ©ricas" magazine that the record's "overwhelming blend of great melodies, string-loaded courses of action, and inconspicuous contemporary impacts turned out to be the ideal equation to stir the bolero's sleeping interests by and by." 

In his book, "The Latin Beat: The Rhythms And Roots Of Latin Music From Bossa Nova To Salsa And Beyond", Ed Morales composed that Miguel's joint effort with Manzanero "conveyed light to a neglected ace of [bolero]" and "was a noteworthy update of the class". "Sentiment" improved Silvetti's notoriety for being an arranger and maker; as indicated by Leila Cobo of "Board", the collection "completely re-imagined the translations of conventional boleros" and "started a downpour of work for Silvetti, incorporating records with Vic Damone and Engelbert Humperdinck". His game plans wound up known as the "Silvetti Sound", which Cobo portrayed as "tied down in clearing songs, rich string courses of action, acoustic instrumentation, or more all, audacious sentimentalism". "Romance"s achievement supported Linda Ronstadt, JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez and PlÃ¡cido Domingo to record current adaptations of customary boleros. As indicated by Miguel's previous administrator Mauricio Abaroa, in spite of the fact that boleros were as yet recorded by customary artists at the time, "what made Luis Miguel so fruitful was that it was a young fellow singing them and that he sang them like present day ditties". Amid the "Bulletin" Hot Latin Songs Chart's 25th commemoration in 2011, Miguel was number one on the Hot Latin Songs Top Artists graph. Manzanero thought about their association, saying that he "put in the mouths of his age the majority of the incredible sentimental melodies that had a 30-year history". In 2015, "Announcement" recorded "Sentiment" as one of the Essential Latin Albums of Past 50 Years, a proofreader expresses: "What's turned out to be so predictable in Latin music nowadays - the tribute collection by a contemporary craftsman regarding a virtuoso of another period - began with "Sentiment"". 

The collection's prosperity urged Miguel to record three increasingly "Sentiment" records. Its development, "Segundo Romance", was discharged in 1994; Manzanero, CalderÃ³n and Kiko Cibrian co-delivered with Miguel, and it won a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Performance. In 1997 "Sentiments" was discharged, with Miguel and Manzanero co-creating Silvetti's courses of action; it sold over 4.5Â million duplicates, winning another Grammy for Best Latin Pop Performance. After a year WEA Latina discharged "Todos Los Romances", a three-plate aggregation of the sentiment themed records. The fourth record in the arrangement, "Mis Romances" (delivered by Miguel), was discharged in 2001. Despite the fact that the vocalist had arranged a ten-collection arrangement, "Mis Romances" was basically and monetarily ineffective. The next year saw the arrival of "Mis Boleros Favoritos", with 13 beforehand recorded tracks from the "Sentiment" arrangement and another adaptation of "Hasta Que Vuelvas". As per AllMusic supervisor IvÃ¡n Adaime, the record's motivation was to "close this time" of the "Sentiment" arrangement. In 2012, Warner Music Latina reissued a dedicatory "Sentiment: twentieth Anniversary" set with a CD, the first LP record and three 45 rpm singles: "Inolvidable", "No SÃ© TÃº" and "Contigo en la Distancia".
