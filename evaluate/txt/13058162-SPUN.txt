It was held at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor on September 1, 2007, and was the primary round of the period for the two groups. The Wolverines entered the diversion positioned No. 5 in both significant Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) surveys and news sources believed them to be preseason top picks to win the Big Ten meeting title just as conceivable contenders for the national title, while the Mountaineers were positioned No. 1 in The Sports Network's Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) survey and were preseason top choices to win their third continuous FCS national title. 

Recreations among FBS and FCS groups commonly result in disproportionate triumphs for the FBS group, and the Appalachian Stateâ Michigan diversion was not expected to be a special case. The anticipated result was an unbalanced triumph for Michigan. Las Vegas sportsbooks did not give a wagering line. The diversion was additionally the first to be communicated on the then-new Big Ten Network. It started with a solid first half for Appalachian State, who held a 28â 17 lead toward the finish of the half. Michigan recaptured the lead at 32â 31 in the final quarter, however Appalachian State led the pack for a second time on a short field objective with 26Â seconds left. The Mountaineers obstructed a diversion winning field objective endeavor from Michigan toward the finish of guideline to verify a 34â 32 win. 

Quickly hailed as one of the best bombshells in school football history, the diversion filled in as the lead story of "SportsCenter" and was the main story for the next week's release of "Sports Illustrated". Appalachian State turned into the second FCS group to overcome a positioned FBS group, and because of the diversion Michigan dropped out of the best 25 of the AP Poll completely, denoting the first run through a group had tumbled from the main five to out of the survey totally as the consequence of a solitary amusement. In the outcome of the diversion, the Associated Press revised their surveying arrangement to make FCS groups qualified for the AP Poll, which had recently been constrained to FBS groups. 

The Appalachian State Mountaineers completed the 2007 season with a 13â 2 record and won a third successive FCS title. They likewise turned into the main FCS group to get cast a ballot in the last AP Poll, tying South Florida for the 34th by and large positioning. Michigan completed their season 9â 4, winning the Capital One Bowl, and positioned No. 18 in the last AP Poll. A rematch in 2014 at Michigan Stadium was won definitively by the Wolverines, 52â 14. The 2014 rematch was the Mountaineers' first amusement as a FBS school. 

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is part into three divisions: Division I, Division II, and Division III. As per the NCAA, Division I comprises of "the biggest projects that give the most physically related budgetary guide for understudy competitors". Division I football is part into two subdivisions: the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). "USA Today" takes note of that the FBS is viewed as the level at which significant Division I colleges play, while the FCS is a level in which littler projects contend. FBS part groups are permitted to have up to 85 grant players, while FCS part groups are permitted to grant 63 grants. Be that as it may, FCS groups can partition their 63 grants by giving a few players 'incomplete grants'. FBS groups compete to play in bowl amusements, while FCS groups expect to fit the bill for a postseason competition. The two subdivisions were made in 1978, and no other Division I sports are part in such a way. The distinction between the two subdivisions is sufficiently incredible that John V. Lombardi, a previous chancellor at UMass, which played FCS football before moving to FBS in 2012, and a previous president at FBS-level Florida and Louisiana State, said that "even a dreadful group in [FBS] football has higher perceivability than an extraordinary group in [FCS]." 

FBS groups are permitted to plan FCS groups, and one win against a FCS group can be checked towards their bowl-qualified status gave the FCS group meets certain grant prerequisites. FCS groups are frequently paid upwards of USD $500,000 for taking an interest in amusements against FBS groups. This course of action for the most part results in unbalanced misfortunes for FCS groups, yet the cash FCS schools procure from amusements against FBS groups helps finance their athletic divisions, just as offering more extensive introduction for their athletic projects. 

Appalachian State had routinely planned FBS groups, playing against schools, for example, Auburn in 1999, Kansas and LSU in 2005, and NC State in 2006. They likewise had recreations against Wake Forest in each season from 1979 to 1996, just as in 1998, 2000, and 2001. Appalachian State had won six of these diversions, every one of them against Wake Forest. The Mountaineers had not beaten a FBS group since 2000. Michigan, a notable school football control with a huge fan base, had never played a FCS group. As indicated by Appalachian State athletic chief Charlie Cobb, the two schools had holes in their timetable as late as February 2007; the fellowship between Mountaineers mentor Jerry Moore and Wolverines mentor Lloyd Carr assumed a key job in finishing the arrangement. While endeavoring to decide the measure of cash Appalachian State would be paid for playing Michigan, arrangements between the two schools achieved a stop. Moore went to class authorities and encouraged them to acknowledge any offer Michigan gave them; he disclosed to them that "It's an open door diversion. It'll be a one-shot, unique arrangement to go up there and play. It's a mind boggling condition." Appalachian State at last settled on a $400,000 installment as a byproduct of playing against Michigan to open the 2007 season. 

Michigan was relied upon to helpfully vanquish Appalachian State, who entered the amusement as extensive dark horses. Las Vegas sports books did not offer a wagering line since they trusted that it would be a jumble. The day preceding the amusement, an Associated Press article said that the Mountaineers were "practically sure to lose seriously" and "aren't required to be anything over conciliatory sheep." Another article anticipated that Michigan would effortlessly win, yet that Michigan's unpracticed auxiliary could be tried by quarterback Armanti Edwards. This shortcoming is the thing that the Mountaineers would have liked to profit by: they went through a large portion of the week paving the way to the diversion concentrating amusement film, and felt that the Michigan guard tended to leave the center of the field exposed. Then again, the Mountaineers came up short on the profundity of the Wolverines, having 22 less grant players. 

Appalachian State were positioned as the No. 1 group in the preseason FCS survey from The Sports Network, getting 67 out of 70 ahead of all comers cast a ballot. The group had won the past two FCS national titles and were top picks to win a third successive title as indicated by news sources. They had additionally won their last 14 amusements, the longest in either Division I subdivision at the time. They had a general record of 6â 34â 1 against major FBS groups. The Mountaineers ran a no-group, spread alternative framework, which they executed in 2005, their first title season. Two of the significant hostile weapons for the group were Edwards, who had scored 15 passing touchdowns and 15 hurrying touchdowns in 2006, and running back Kevin Richardson, who had scored a FCS-record 30 surging touchdowns in 2006. The protective unit for the Mountaineers was helmed by Corey Lynch, a security; the Mountaineer safeguard positioned eleventh in surge guard and 35th in pass barrier amid the 2006 season, however the group lost five of its six best tacklers from that season, just as cautious lineman Marques Murrell, who drove the FCS in sacks amid the 2006 season. In spite of misfortunes at the protective line, the auxiliary, the group's cautious solid point, remained for all intents and purposes unblemished from the past season. The Mountaineers' kicker was senior Julian Rauch, who made 10 out of 14 field objective endeavors amid the 2006 season. 

Michigan entered the diversion as the No. 5-positioned group in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. News sources anticipated the group as top picks to win the Big Ten gathering, and as contenders for a national title. Michigan highlighted a solid senior class of hostile handle Jake Long, half back Mike Hart, and quarterback Chad Henne, every one of whom had chosen to remain in school instead of proclaim qualification for the NFL Draft. The players credited their choice to a few components, for example, Michigan having lost their last three diversions to match Ohio State and the Wolverines' dash of three successive bowl misfortunes. The three additionally wanted to complete their school vocations on a high note. Imprint Schlabach of ESPN.com expressed that "[the trio], alongside recipients Mario Manningham and Adrian Arrington, gives Michigan what could conceivably be a standout amongst the most hazardous offenses in school football". Preceding the season, the group named Hart and Long as chiefs, alongside linebacker Shawn Crable, a fifth-year senior. Michigan intended to open the amusement in a three-beneficiary arrangement, which can possibly spread the restricting barrier out; Michigan mentor Lloyd Carr noticed that "when you have a portion of the expertise that we have at the wide collector positions and can spread a safeguard out, that is [a] positive." in the meantime, Michigan was foreseen to run just a constrained choice of plays from this set, to confine the capacity of their up and coming adversaries to build up a successful course of action against them. Michigan's safeguard, which drove the FBS in run guard in 2006, lost seven starters from the past season, including four All-Americans (cornerback Leon Hall and cautious linemen Alan Branch, David Harris, and LaMarr Woodley), every one of whom were drafted in the initial two rounds of the 2007 NFL Draft. Wolverines linebacker Chris Graham, a senior, anticipated that the guard should be characterized by speed, noticing that each situation on the resistance was "stacked in speed". 

The amusement was the first ever to be communicated on the Big Ten Network. At the time the system had roughly 17 million supporters, the majority of which originated from an arrangement with DirecTV. As per Mark Silverman, the leader of the Big Ten Network, just a "little rate" of Wolverine fans had the capacity to watch it. Silverman credited this to the way that Comcast and Charter, two of the significant satellite TV suppliers in the territory of Michigan, did not convey the Big Ten Network. Thom Brennaman gave play-by-play discourse, Charles Davis executed as the shading expert, and Charissa Thompson revealed from the sidelines.
