This office is in this way put under the watchful eye of therapist Hugo Strangeâwho is subtly controlling Sharpâand observed by a rebel private military firm, TYGER Security.

An attentive Batman keeps up his very own vigil over the new undertaking, worried that the disorganized circumstance there will escape hand. In the interim, the Joker is experiencing a possibly lethal malady brought about by his past utilization of the Titan recipe, an insecure steroid serum which transforms men into infuriated beasts. 

At a question and answer session held by Bruce Wayne to announce his restriction to Arkham City, TYGER hired soldiers capture and detain him in Arkham City. Hugo Strange reveals his insight into Wayne's double way of life as Batman before discharging him into the jail's criminal masses. While Strange gets ready to initiate "Convention 10", Wayne acquires his hardware by means of airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, enabling him to progress toward becoming Batman. He first spares Catwoman from being executed by Two-Face, who would like to pick up regard by killing her. After Joker endeavors to kill Catwoman, Batman tracks him to his safehouse in the Sionis Steelmill, trusting Joker may know reality behind Protocol 10. 

There, Batman discovers that the precarious properties of the Titan equation are changing in Joker's blood, step by step murdering him.

With Ra's al Ghul's blood, Freeze can build up a counteractant, yet it is stolen by Harley Quinn before Batman can utilize it.

Rocksteady considered the possibility of a spin-off before improvement of "Arkham Asylum" had finished up, creating thoughts for both the story and setting so the amusements' stories could be adequately associated; a mystery room was covered up in the refuge superintendent's office in "Arkham Asylum" containing insights of how the continuation would advance, including outlines for the Arkham City jail; the plans are very like its last design in "Arkham City". The first thought was to remove the diversion from the refuge setting and onto the roads of Gotham City while holding the dimension of configuration detail put into the haven. To that end they needed to incorporate areas from the Batman mythos that were prominent and important to the character, rather than a progression of nonexclusive boulevards; Rocksteady was at first uncertain how specialized contemplations would constrain the extent of this thought. 

Genuine advancement of the amusement's story and idea began in February 2009, as groups were moved from "Arkham Asylum" to "Arkham City"s improvement as they finished the work on that diversion. When they had customized Batman to plunge and float between structures of the refuge, the adaption of the ongoing interaction to the city was viewed as normal. Rocksteady chose to exclude the Batmobile, on the grounds that it is unfit to go on the city's broken territory. Batman's floating gave an adequate methods for transportation, and it was viewed as that placing Batman in any vehicle would make it a totally unique diversion. Sefton Hill, "Arkham City"s chief from Rocksteady Studios, expressed that a key objective for the amusement was to convey the "'Batman in Gotham' feeling." The continuation was depicted by Conroy as "ridiculously dim". While relating the amusement's dim nature to the energized motion picture "", Conroy additionally stated, "It includes a great deal of the scalawags and it goes to that areaÂ â it's that dim." 

As a component of the "Batman in Gotham" structure theory, Batman's munititions stockpile of moves and activities were extended. In spite of the fact that the group built up a few thoughts for new moves, contraptions and capacities, they just went ahead with those that they felt would be real to Batman. They likewise had Batman begin the amusement with access to the devices opened in "Arkham Asylum", to pass on the feeling that Batman is completely arranged for the certainty of things turning out badly in Arkham City. The studio checked on the play and battle frameworks utilized in "Arkham Asylum", and constructed the new moves as characteristic expansions of the current framework as a way to "include significantly more profundity and interactivity as opposed to transforming them generally". The quantity of activitys were multiplied to mirror the bigger arms stockpile of moves at the player's transfer. The X-beam like "Investigator Vision" mode used to feature certain items in-diversion was redeveloped for "Arkham City" since it was viewed as excessively valuable in "Arkham Asylum", bringing about certain players utilizing it all through nearly the whole amusement; the special visualization additionally clouded the diversion's structure stylish. One thought was to present a period limit on its utilization, yet it was viewed as that Batman "wouldn't make a contraption like that". Rather, the mode was intended to be hard to use in specific circumstances, for example, darkening navigational data, and battle where foe strikes will obscure the screen when "Investigator Vision" is dynamic. Rocksteady workmanship chief David Hego depicted the new "Criminologist Vision" as an "expanded reality mode". 

Another way the designers wished to upgrade the player's Batman experience was through the bigger diversion world. "Arkham City" has a virtual impression multiple times bigger than that of "Arkham Asylum", and the navigational angles were improved to offer the player "the opportunity and elation of skimming down back streets and taking off over the horizon". In spite of the fact that the ideas were contrasted with an open world amusement, Hill noticed that such freestyle nature would not be proper for a Batman diversion since it would restrain the climate they needed to make, and that "Arkham City" was intended to move the player to think like Batman to endure. To balance the bigger amusement world, the designers likewise tried to incorporate more difficulties and side missions while keeping the player alert with regards to the essential mission, to such an extent that the players continually know about "extraordinary weight of the difficulties that they face". The Riddler Trophies were structured towards the finish of the diversion's advancement and were fused into each region of the guide without overpopulating it, bringing about 440 trophies. Rocksteady meant to make the player think imaginatively when gathering trophies by requiring the utilization of devices to explain bewilders, instead of putting the trophies in cloud regions of the guide as negligible accumulation things. 

With the open diversion world, Rocksteady included more reprobates to make difficulties for Batman. Hugo Strange was chosen as an essential foe, as his capacity and controlling way help keep up the lockdown on Arkham City once Batman enters. Odd knows about Batman's actual character, making Batman "powerless and uncovered such that he has never been", as indicated by Hill. He noticed that Strange is a character new to numerous players however that his backstory and character are definite all through the amusement. Catwoman was likewise included dependent on her long history with Batman, however she was given her own plan running parallel to the occasions inside Arkham City. Catwoman's missions at first finished with her going to Batman's helper, yet late being developed, the designers chose to give the player a substitute decision, enabling them to have the ethically dim Catwoman leave the city with her plunder; the expansion was actualized in two days. Batman's sidekick Robin additionally shows up, highlighting a shaved head and contemporary outfit plan that were expected to move far from his conventional "Kid Wonder" picture. Senior idea craftsman Kan Muftic clarified: "Our vision of Robin is the one of a beset youthful person that is quiet and withdrawn now and again, however perilous and forceful whenever incited. The shaved head is motivated by enclosure warriors, since we believed that Robin may do that in his extra time to keep him on his toes. In any case, we kept all the great trademarks of Robin's appearance, for example, the red and yellow shades of his outfit, the cape and the cover." Rocksteady initially did not plan to incorporate Robin in the principle story however later chose to as a genuine methods for conveying new devices to Batman, just as to present their form of the character and his association with Batman. 

Rocksteady expected for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three diverse playing encounters. Different reprobates from Batman's comic history were chosen to demonstrate that the jail was a blend of individuals from Gotham. The designers trusted that giving a little piece of every scalawag's story as opposed to concentrating on a chosen few enabled the player to meet a lot more characters and successfully passed on the sentiment of being in a superprison loaded up with supervillains. Rocksteady chose at an opportune time that the Joker would pass on in the story, and built up the possibility of him harming Batman with a similar suffering, so as to demonstrate how the two oppositely contradicted characters would interface in quest for a common objective. Warner Bros. furthermore, Dini did not contradict slaughtering off the character as long as it was not accomplished for stun esteem, and as long as they clarified that Batman was not to blame, since he would not deliberately murder somebody. 

The engineers had considered adding a multiplayer component to the amusement, in any case ruled against it. As per Hill, "On the off chance that we utilize the majority of the vitality that is required to make multiplayer and rather center this around the single player, would that convey a superior in general amusement?", and chose in the positive. 

Assortment was added to the city itself, as specific zones were planned around the miscreants that control that specific domain. Dax Ginn, advertising diversion administrator at Rocksteady Games, stated, "On the off chance that you move into Joker's region, you get a very Joker-ized experience, and all the work of art on the buildingsÂ â whether that is spray painting, signage, or whatever it may beÂ â gives you a thick sort of Joker experience. So our craft group has truly put a great deal of exertion in making that kind of change between one turf zone to anotherÂ â truly helping the player feel like they're making a physical progress into another enthusiastic space." The engineering was instilled with nineteenth century Art Nouveau structure, for example, Strange's Wonder Tower which was enlivened by the Eiffel Tower, while character plans utilized an advanced Hyperrealism style. To keep the conditions fascinating, base shading plans, for example, Mr Freeze's ice-themed region, Joker's flame themed steel factory, and Poison Ivy's wilderness themed territory were populated with differentiating components: for instance, the steel plant utilizes huge, white comedian appearances to differentiate the oranges and reds utilized all through. To build up the extended condition of "Arkham City" and construct a "characteristic urban condition" for Batman, Rocksteady extended its workforce from 75 to more than 100 individuals.

"Arkham City"s promoting effort was intended to contact a group of people outside of hero fans and offer to customers who are pulled in to recreations like the primary individual shooter arrangement "Honorable obligation". Warner Bros'. advertising group concluded that Batman's status as a social symbol and hero was unavoidable, so they chose to underscore different components of the character that could speak to aficionados of first-individual shooters and activity amusements. Highly contrasting photos of notorious identities like designer Steve Jobs and on-screen character James Dean filled in as motivation and a reason for the last showcasing effort utilized in commercials and the amusement's spread craftsmanship. The symbolism, featured with blood and washed in light was considered to move far from the exemplary superhuman picture and refocus on Batman's mankind.
