Truman's family moved west to Washington state, attracted to the guarantee of shoddy land and the effective timber industry in the Pacific Northwest; they settled on of farmland in the eastern part of Lewis County, Washington. He went to secondary school in the city of Mossyrock, Washington, at that point enrolled in the Army as a private in August 1917. He was allocated to the 100th Aero Squadron, seventh Squad and prepared as an aeromechanic and served in France amid . Amid his administration, he supported wounds because of his daring and autonomous nature. While in transit to Europe, his troopship, "Tuscania", was sunk by a German U-pontoon in a torpedo assault off the shoreline of Ireland. He was respectably released in June 1919, and he started prospecting, however neglected to accomplish his objective of getting to be rich.

Sooner or later, he came back to Chehalis, Washington, where he ran a car administration and gas station called Harry's Sudden Service. He likewise wedded the girl of a sawmill proprietor; they had one little girl. 

Truman became worn out on human advancement following a couple of years and rented from the Northern Pacific Railroad Company sitting above Spirit Lake in the wild close Mount St. Helens, a stratovolcano situated in Skamania County, Washington. He settled at the foot of the mountain and opened a service station and a market; he in the end opened the Mount St. Helens Lodge, near the outlet of Spirit Lake, which he worked for a long time.

In the Mount St. Helens region, Truman ended up famous for his shenanigans, once getting a woodland officer alcoholic with the goal that he could consume a heap of brush. He poached, stole rock from the National Park Service, and angled on American Indian land with a phony amusement superintendent identification. Regardless of their insight into these crimes, nearby officers neglected to get him in the demonstration. The Washington state government later changed the state deals charge, yet Truman continued charging a similar rate. An assessment office representative leased a pontoon from him yet wouldn't make good on his regulatory expense rate, so Truman pushed him into Spirit Lake. 

Truman was a fanatic of the mixed drink Schenley bourbon and Coca-Cola. He claimed a pink 1957 Cadillac, and he swore every now and again. He adored talking about legislative issues and purportedly abhorred Republicans, flower children, youthful youngsters, and particularly elderly individuals. He once would not permit Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas to remain at his hotel, rejecting him as an "old coot". He altered his opinion when he took in Douglas' personality, pursued him for , and persuaded him to remain. 

At the point when his better half Edna passed on in 1978, Truman shut his hotel and a while later just leased a bunch of water crafts and lodges amid the mid year. 

Truman turned into a minor VIP amid the two months of volcanic movement going before the , offering meetings to journalists and communicating his feeling that the risk was misrepresented. "I don't have any thought whether it will blow," he stated, "however I don't trust it to the point that I'm going to pack up." Truman showed little worry about the well of lava and his circumstance: "If the mountain goes, I'm running with it. This zone is intensely timbered, Spirit Lake is in the middle of me and the mountain, and the mountain is a mile away, the mountain ain't going to hurt me." Law authorization authorities were enraged by his refusal to empty since media agents continued entering the limited zone close to the spring of gushing lava to talk with him, imperiling themselves all the while. All things considered, Truman stayed resolute. "You couldn't haul me out with a donkey group. That mountain's a piece of Truman and Truman's a piece of that mountain." 

Truman told journalists that he was thumped from his bed by antecedent seismic tremors, so he reacted by moving his sleeping cushion to the storm cellar. He professed to wear goads to bed to adapt to the tremors while he rested. He laughed at the open's anxiety for his wellbeing, reacting to researchers' cases about the risk of the fountain of liquid magma that "the mountain has shot its wad and it hasn't harmed my place a bit, yet those goddamn geologists with their hair down to their butts wouldn't give no consideration to ol' Truman." 

Because of his resistant analysis, Truman moved toward becoming something of a society legend and was the subject of numerous melodies and lyrics by youngsters. One gathering of kids from Salem, Oregon, sent him standards recorded "Harry â We Love You", which moved him so much that he took a helicopter trip (paid for by "National Geographic") to visit them on May 14. He likewise gotten many fan letters, including a few propositions to be engaged. A gathering of fifth graders from Grand Blanc, Michigan, composed letters that conveyed him to tears. Consequently, he sent them a letter and volcanic fiery remains, which the understudies later sold to purchase blossoms for his family after the emission. 

He caused a media furor, showing up on the first page of "The New York Times" and "The San Francisco Examiner" and drawing in the consideration of "National Geographic", United Press International, and "The Today Show". Many significant magazines formed profiles, including "Time", "Life", "Newsweek", "Field and Stream", and "Peruser's Digest". An antiquarian named Richard W. Slatta composed that "his red hot frame of mind, reckless discourse, love of the outside, and furious autonomyâ¦ made him a people saint the media could love." Slatta indicated Truman's "unbendable character and reaction to the powers of nature" as a wellspring of his ascent to acclaim, and the meetings with him included "shading" to reports about the occasions at Mount St. Helens. Truman was deified, as per Slatta, "with a significant number of the adorned characteristics of the western legend", and the media spotlight made a persona that was "somehow or another very not quite the same as his actual character." 

As the probability of ejection expanded, state authorities attempted to clear the territory except for a couple of researchers and security authorities. On May 17, they endeavored one last time to induce Truman to leave, without much of any result. The well of lava emitted the following morning, and its whole northern flank fallen. Truman was separated from everyone else at his cabin with his 16 felines, and is dared to have passed on in the ejection on May 18.

Specialists never discovered Truman's remaining parts. Truman's felines are attempted to have kicked the bucket with him; he thought about them family and referenced them in practically all open articulations. 

Companions trusted that Truman may have made due, as he had professed to have provisioned a deserted mine with nourishment and alcohol if there should arise an occurrence of an emission, however the absence of quick cautioning of the approaching ejection may have kept him from getting away to the pole before the pyroclastic stream achieved his hotel (not exactly a moment after it started). His sister Geraldine said that she thought that it was difficult to acknowledge the truth of his demise. "I don't think he made it, yet I thought whether they would give me a chance to fly over and see with my own eyes that Harry's cabin is gone, at that point perhaps I'd trust it without a doubt." Truman's niece Shirley Rosen included that her uncle figured he could get away from the spring of gushing lava however was not anticipating the parallel emission. She expressed that her sister took him a container of bourbon to induce him to clear, however he was too hesitant to even consider drinking liquor at the time since he was uncertain whether the shaking was originating from his body or the seismic tremors. His assets were unloaded as remembrances to admirers in September 1980. 

Truman rose as a people saint for his protection from the clearing endeavors. "The Columbian" expressed: "With his 10-dollar name and damnation no-I-won't-go disposition, Truman was a set aside a few minutes people legend." His loved ones remarked: "He was an obstinate individual." Truman's companion John Garrity included, "The mountain and the lake were his life. In the event that he'd left and, at that point saw what the mountain did to his lake, it would have slaughtered him in any case. He generally said he needed to kick the bucket at Spirit Lake. He went how he would have preferred to go." Truman's niece Shirley expressed, "He used to state that is my mountain and my lake and he would state those are my arms and my legs. On the off chance that he would have seen it the manner in which it is currently, I don't figure he would have endure." Truman's cousin Richard Ice remarked that Truman's brief period as a big name might have been "an incredible pinnacle."
