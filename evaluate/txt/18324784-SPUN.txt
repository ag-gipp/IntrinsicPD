Conceived in the town of Sunshine on the edges of Melbourne, Miller made game the point of convergence of his initial life. The most youthful of four offspring of Scottish plummet, Miller joined his kin in being instilled with an adoration for game by their dad, playing football in winter and cricket in summer. Mill operator's dadâa designer and sportsloverâaccentuated the significance of procedure over power; Miller profited as he was of little stature amid his adolescence and couldn't depend on savage quality. Mill operator longed to be a steed dashing racer, as he felt that he would not have the physical make-up to prevail in cricket or football. 

Mill operator got his auxiliary training at the scholastically specific Melbourne High School, where his science educator was the occupant Australian cricket skipper Bill Woodfull. He was a scholastically poor understudy who disregarded his examinations however exceeded expectations at games. He settled on the school's first-decision cricket group at 14 years old and picked up consideration for his specialized and cautious capacity, which was contrasted with that of Woodfull. Mill operator was dismissed by the St Kilda Cricket Club so he joined South Melbourne in locale rivalry, making his first-grade debut toward the beginning of the 1935â 36 season, still just tall. In one match, he scored 61 rushes to coordinate a lower-request fightback in a low-scoring match against Woodfull's Carlton group, provoking his educator to grant him a silver eggcup amid maths class. It stayed a standout amongst his most loved belongings. 

In the next year, Miller developed and started to play cricket and football with more power. Leaving school toward the finish of year 10, having quite recently turned 17, Miller played cricket for the Victorian Colts for two seasons, before getting through to be chosen for his five star debut late in the 1937â 38 season. He played sporadically until making his Sheffield Shield debut amid the 1939â 40 season and scoring his lady century. Amid this time, Miller played only as a batsman; he was yet to turn into a quick bowler. Mill operator's football vocation additionally took off. Beginning in 1937, Miller played for the Brighton Football Club in the Victorian Football Association for a long time, for the most part as a safeguard. Toward the beginning of his fourth season, he confined Bob Pratt, viewed as the best forward of the time, to one objective for the match and was named best on ground. He was immediately marked by the St Kilda Football Club to play in the main Victorian Football League in 1940, where his group came next to last. 

Conceived in the western Melbourne suburb of Sunshine on 28 November 1919, Keith Ross Miller was the most youthful of Leslie (Les Sr) and Edith (Edie) Miller's four kids. He had two more established siblings and a sister. Sister Gladys was 12 when Miller was conceived, while Les Jr and Ray were nine and seven individually. Mill operator was named after the Australian pioneer pilot siblings Keith and Ross Smith, who were part of the way through their notable departure from England to Australia at the season of his introduction to the world. Mill operator's two Christian names mirrored his Scottish legacy; his dad's family began from the dock region of Edinburgh and Dundee, and his fatherly granddad touched base in Australia in April 1849. The family lived in a one-level patio house in Sunshine, which at the time was a different town of 900 individuals, west of Melbourne's downtown area. The region was and remains an average workers zone. The town's backbone was the ranch apparatus producer H. V. McKay, which utilized a vast extent of the populace. Mill operator's dad began as an educator in Warracknabeal in rustic Victoria, before functioning as a specialist for McKay in Ballarat until an exchange conveyed him to Sunshine. 

Daylight offered open fields, and the three Miller young men rapidly favored game amid their youth, playing Australian guidelines football in winter and cricket in summer. Their dad had played cricket for Warracknabeal, winning a prevalence in the neighborhood association in 1900. Les educated the young men to play with a side-on position and underlined the significance of standard batting procedure, reminding his children to keep up a high driving elbow when hitting the ball. They were educated to depend on a strong resistance, fixation, and discretion in the shape of the main Victorian and Australian Test batsman of the time, Bill Ponsford. Mill operator started his tutoring in Sunshine, where he rapidly wound up known for his minute stature; he was one of the littlest kids in the school. At seven years old, Miller moved to the inward eastern white collar class Melbourne suburb of Elsternwick, where his folks had obtained a two-story house with an open greenery enclosure that enabled the kids to play sport. At this point, his senior siblings had given him the criticizing epithet "Weedy". Mill operator's little size and age shortage implied that he surrendered a quality preferred standpoint to his siblings in patio cricket matches. This constrained him to build up his procedure instead of depend on power, which held him in great stead for his future vocation. At whatever point Miller figured out how to reject his siblings and gain himself some batting time, he normally played with a straight bat in an attentive way, as it was troublesome for him to evacuate his siblings, implying that his chances with the bat were uncommon. Mill operator and his companions would dally outside Ponsford's home, only away, in the expectation of getting a look at their saint. Like Miller in his patio, Ponsford was known for his forces of focus and was the principal individual to score two fourfold hundreds of years in top of the line cricket. Mill operator frequently rehearsed for quite a long time without anyone else; he put a tennis ball inside a stocking, before suspending it from a garments line and hitting it forward and backward. Inside, Miller built up a long lasting adoration for established music through a cousin who got a kick out of the chance to play Mozart. He played woodwind in the Elsternwick school band however couldn't peruse music. 

As a little tyke, Miller's major wearing desire was to be a racer, however he kept on playing cricket and Australian football. At 12 years old, he played for an under-15 Victorian students cricket group that visited Queensland under the captaincy of future Test batsman Merv Harvey. At the time, Miller stood just and used a sawn-off bat. His shots did not go far, however he awed onlookers with the way in which he moved his feet and stroked the ball. Mill operator's little stature in a physical game, for example, football constrained him to depend on physical valor, something for which he wound up celebrated. In any case, his absence of tallness provoked him to swing to horseracing. Mill operator saw his first Melbourne Cup in 1926 at seven years old and had been captivated from that point onward. Caulfield Racecourse was just a short separation from the family home, and Miller spent numerous early mornings viewing the coaches and maneuvers experience their schedules. He in the end induced his dad to give him a chance to take horseriding exercises. Beside being pulled in to the dashing society, Miller felt that as he seemed bound to be a little individual, he was bound to have an effective profession as a racer than in cricket or football. 

Mill operator went to the nearby state school before exchanging to Melbourne High Schoolâa particular government organization that acknowledged understudies through a scholarly testâtoward the beginning of 1934. The school's accentuation on academic and brandishing perfection and its way of life was more in accordance with that of a tuition based school than a standard government school. Australian Test skipper Bill Woodfull was on the showing staff as Miller's science instructor. Since he did little investigation and concentrated his vitality on game, Miller was an unremarkable understudy. Notwithstanding cricket and football, Miller played baseball and contended in swimming. This baffled Woodfull, a taught man who summoned the school's maxim "Respect the Work" in admonishing his understudies to buckle down as Australia was endeavoring to rise up out of the profundities of the Great Depression. In spite of being Australia's chief, Woodfull wouldn't include himself in the training of the school's cricket groups, feeling that it would barge in on the obligations of the games educators. Regardless of this, Woodfull viewed the understudies at cricket preparing and immediately seen Miller's aptitudes. Matured 14 and still under , Miller was chosen in the school's First XI. With his cushions fluttering against his stomach and brandishing a sawn-down bat, Miller batted at No. 6 and scored 44 on his senior presentation. In spite of the fact that his absence of intensity was self-evident, Miller's control and strength incited the onlookers to call him "the Unbowlable", a similar moniker that was concurred to Woodfull, who had an also solid guarded style. Melbourne proceeded to win the match, and Miller awed his skipper Keith Truscott, who battled for his determination and encouraged him. Truscott later turned into an expert military pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force, and Miller would emulate his example. Truscott's social impact aggravated the diversions from Miller's examination. Mill operator flopped every one of the eight of his subjects toward the finish of 1934, and with a normal characteristic of 25%, was the class moron. He scored zero in his last, most important test for Woodfull's geometry class, and was compelled to rehash year 9. 

Toward the beginning of the 1934â 35 season, Truscott took Miller to an experiment with St Kilda Cricket Club, however his protege couldn't discover a spot in any of the club's five groups. Joining the neighborhood sub-area cricket club Elsternwick, Miller did not get the opportunity to bat or bowl on presentation, and was then dropped to the Second XI after his first counterpart for poor handling. By and by, the previous Victorian state player Hughie Carroll recognized Miller's ability and tricked him to the opponent South Melbourne club. Be that as it may, Elsternwick utilized the challenge standards to keep Miller from playing for Souths, so he kept on playing in the previous' second-decision group. Meanwhile, Miller kept on playing for his school with relentless outcomes, scoring 30 and 25 of every two matches against Melbourne's primary adversary, University High School. A relaxing of the zoning rules enabled Miller to begin seeking South Melbourne in the accompanying season. Be that as it may, the principles required South Melbourne to play Miller in their First XI, else St Kilda could recover him, so he made his area cricket debut for South toward the beginning of the 1935â 36 season after a preliminary in the nets. At this stage, Miller was simply tallâthe Test batsman Keith Rigg reviewed his first experience with the minor adolescent in an area coordinate: 

It was at South Melbourne that Miller met Ian Johnson and Lindsay Hassett, his future Australia colleagues and chiefs. On presentation against St Kilda, Miller scored just 11 not out subsequent to batting for 62 minutes at No. 7, however spectators felt the youthful batsman would succeed in the event that he physically developed. Mill operator passed his tests toward the finish of 1935 and proceeded with his improvement on the field. He started to build up a leg break and googly and spoke to his school against a meeting student group from Ceylon. Mill operator scored an unbeaten 28 to keep a misfortune and later refered to the experience as expanding his viewpoints towards different societies. Helped by broadly educating in baseball, his improved handling aptitudes saw him set in the slips and he was named as Melbourne High School's cricket sports champion for 1936. Mill operator found the middle value of 86 with the bat and took 13 wickets at a normal of 9.23, including innings figures of seven wickets for 29 keeps running against St Kevin's and 3/5 against University High. These exhibitions incited Woodfull to write in the school magazine that "Mill operator has Test conceivable outcomes". 

In March, Miller played for South Melbourne against Carlton, who were captained by Woodfull. South Melbourne batted first and crumbled to 5/6. The 6th wicket fell at 32, conveying Miller to the wrinkle. He guided his group to 141, and was the last man out for 61 in the wake of putting on a remain of 65 of every 95 minutes with the No. 11. Mill operator struck four limits in a 147-minute innings. The horde of 14,000âthe biggest of the periodâgave Miller an overwhelming applause, and papers contrasted him with Ponsford and Alan Kippax. Carlton proceeded to win, and when clearly this would be the situation, Miller's chief let him bowl out of the blue. The little batsman took his first wicket in area cricket when Test paceman Laurie Nash took a high-jumping get. Mill operator's execution provoked Carlton to give a silver eggcup as a token "for sterling execution". Woodfull gave Miller the trophy amid variable based math class. It was one of only a handful couple of games trophies that Miller kept in later life. 

Amid 1936, Miller experienced an unexpected development spurt, including a three-month time span amid which he added to his tallness. He started to play football with increasingly physical animosity and built up the capacity to jump high and take airborne imprints. The expansion in size enabled Miller to turn into the longest kicker in the school group. Having developed in a year, Miller was unrecognizable to Hassett upon his arrival to South Melbourne the accompanying season. In the end, Miller came to in tallness, obstructing his aspiration to be a racer, despite the fact that he never lost his adoration for the circuit. 

Toward the beginning of the 1936â 37 season, Miller was chosen for the Colts, a state under-21 group that played at locale level. Toward the finish of the 1936 school year, Miller finished year 10 by passing five of his eight subjects. Reluctant towards college thinks about, he left school without completing his leaving year and started filling in as an assistant for a vehicle business. Mill operator felt sure that he could make a profession out of game and hence felt that further instruction was superfluous. 

Mill operator spent the 1937â 38 season with the Colts and won the group's batting trophy for having the best normal; he made 340 keeps running at 42.50. Over the whole challenge, Miller had the eighth most elevated normal. He scored three half-hundreds of years and a 102 against Northcote. At this stage, Miller was a strong, gradual batsman, who amassed his runs step by step, however "The Age" anticipated that his physical development would open his points of view, opining "Once he rounds outâhe is somewhat tall for his weightâMiller ought to turn into a splendid, forceful batsman". Toward the beginning of February 1938, late in the late spring, he made his top notch debut for Victoria as a 18-year-old and hit 181 out of 289 minutes against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. With his expanded power, Miller started to hang the ball over the infield and struck five fours. Amid the 1938â 39 season, he rejoined South Melbourne and played four top of the line matches for Victoria, scoring 125 keeps running at a normal of 25.00. In any case, Miller was yet to play in the Sheffield Shield rivalry, just taking to the field in erratic matches against different groups. In the two matches against Tasmania in December 1938, Miller took his first catch, yet overseen just four, seven not out and three, and he invested a time of energy outside the group. Mill operator was reviewed in March 1939âlate in the seasonâfor two matches against Western Australia in Perth, scoring 111 keeps running at 37.00, indenting his first top notch fifty of the period in the second innings of the principal coordinate. 

Mill operator made more progress as a footballer. In 1937, he pursued his siblings Les and Ray and joined the Brighton Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). The VFA was the second level of Australian tenets football beneath the Victorian Football League (VFL). A safeguard, Miller played his initial two seasons on the flanks; he was yet to achieve his physical pinnacle and did not have the power required to play in focal protective positions until his third season, in 1939. At this stage, he was unfit to hip and shoulder his rivals and depended on his running capacity and exact kicking. 

Amid the 1939â 40 season, Miller was chosen to make his Sheffield Shield debut in a match against South Australia at Adelaide Oval. Batting at No. 4, Miller went to the wrinkle at 2/9 after a top-request breakdown, yet overseen just four keeps running before being gotten by Richard Whitingtonâwith whom he later composed cricket booksâfrom the bowling of Harold Cotton. At the point when Victoria handled, Miller ran out his future "Invincibles" commander Don Bradman; it was the first occasion when that Bradman had been gotten shy of his ground in top of the line cricket. Mill operator likewise took his first catch at Shield level, that of Mervyn Waite. In the second innings, he oversaw seven preceding being bowled by leg spinner Clarrie Grimmett, one of the main bowlers on the planet during the 1930s. One of Miller's partners was Percy Beames, who likewise happened to be his chief at Vacuum Oil, where he had moved from his first employment. Mill operator made 41 and 47 not out in his second match against Queensland, top-scoring in the second innings as his group finished a seven-wicket triumph. Mill operator held his place for the match against New South Wales, yet was out for 14 in the two innings. He experienced issues against leg turn, tumbling to Bill O'Reilly and Cec Pepper. In the arrival coordinate against South Australia, Miller chose to step up against Grimmett, pursuing the wicket to drive the leg spinner. He included in a 165-run organization with Hassett, and on occasion feigned Grimmett by pushing ahead before reclining after the bowler had balanced his length. Mill operator achieved 108 to finish his first century in Shield rivalry. He was given out gotten by Bradman from Garth Burton, after an intrigue for a debated catch; Miller inquired as to whether Bradman had gotten a knock ball. By and by, Bradman adulated Miller's innings, and Clem Hill anticipated a splendid future for the Victorian. Aside from the century, Miller had a normal season, making 37, 1 and 24 in his outstanding innings to end the battle with 298 keeps running at 29.80. He didn't bowl amid the season. 

In 1940, Miller began his fourth season in the VFA. In a match against Coburg, viewed as one of the most grounded groups in the challenge, he was doled out to man Bob Pratt, who was viewed as the best forward of the period. Pratt had scored 678 objectives in ten seasons for South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL), the top level of football, and had scored in excess of 100 objectives in every one of his last three seasons. Mill operator limited Pratt to one objective for the match and was named as the best on ground. In the second from last quarter, Miller confined Pratt to two imprints, and in the final quarter, he kept the forward from getting a solitary kick. Scouts from the VFL club St Kilda marked Miller on the spot. Responding to Miller's marking, "The Age" opined that he "is a standout amongst the most encouraging players ever to enter class positions, and can be played anyplace in protection. It was he who kept Bob Pratt to one objective in a week ago's Association coordinate." 

At the time, World War II had broken out and by mid-1940, France, Belgium and the Netherlands had tumbled to Nazi Germany. Australia had pronounced war on Germany and Miller needed to join the military, yet St Kilda revealed to him that in the event that he was sent outside Victoria, his profession would be in peril. Subsequently, Miller delayed his enrollment until the finish of the period. 

Playing as a protector, Miller appeared for St Kilda in their fifth round home amusement against Carlton, at the Junction Oval on 25 May, playing on the half-back flank. Toward the beginning of the amusement, Miller's rival Ron Cooper lord hit and concussed him. Mill operator said of the experience, "I adapted more in a second or two than I would have in a year". At the point when St Kilda met Carlton in the arrival coordinate at Princes Park, Miller bear knock Cooper in the primary moment of the match, driving his adversary out the field. In a match against Richmond, Miller was physically focused by prestigious authority Jack Dyer, known as "Chief Blood". In any case, Dyer slipped and missed Miller.
