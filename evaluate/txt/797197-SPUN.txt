Continuously one of his classmates and without stable supervision at home, Fleury received a forceful stance and later portrayed himself as a domineering jerk. He swung to hockey as an outlet when he acquired an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first diversion at five years old. Starting there on, he played hockey at each chance, frequently going with his dad to the field in Russell in the pre-first light hours. He was depicted by his instructors as a decided youth, who might rehash any action he fizzled at until he hit the nail on the head. 

In spite of the fact that his mom was a Jehovah's Witness, Fleury was raised as a Roman Catholic. He went to mass from age 6 to 12, filling in as a church youth until the congregation's cleric kicked the bucket of a heart assault, denying Fleury of one of his most punctual positive impacts. Continually deficient with regards to cash and a steady home, Fleury got support from the network, specifically the Peltz family in Russell, who guaranteed that he and his siblings were nourished and got them new garments when required. In January 1982, Fleury's fantasies of playing in the NHL almost finished at 13 years old while, amid an amusement, he endured a profound cut under his arm that separated his brachial course.

Continuously one of the littlest players in the amusement, Fleury realized early that he needed to play a flighty style of diversion to make due against players a lot bigger than he was. He found that the most ideal approach to secure himself was to scare his rivals by playing a feisty, physical diversion, which he said prompted numerous retaliatory punishments and a few contentions with his mentors. He recorded 235 minutes in punishments in his last year of junior, almost 100 more than any of the other top 10 WHL scorers. Fleury held this style of play all through his hockey profession, routinely amazing adversaries who felt their size was preference. 

Fleury twice spoken to Canada at the World Junior Hockey Championships. He originally joined the group for the 1987 competition in PieÅ¡Å¥any, Czechoslovakia. The competition is best associated with the "Punch-up in Piestany" on January 4, 1987, a notorious seat clearing fight between the Canadians and the Soviet Union. Fleury scored the main objective of the diversion and, as a major aspect of his festival, utilized his stick to emulate shooting an assault rifle at the Soviet seat, a move that was condemned by Canadian authorities.

The Calgary Flames drafted him in the eighth round, 166th in general, of the 1987 NHL Entry Draft. After finishing his lesser season in 1988, Fleury marked his first expert contract, worth C$415,000, and joined the Flames' International Hockey League (IHL) partner, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles.

He found the middle value of almost two points for every diversion, recording 37Â assists to lead the IHL in scoring after 40Â games. Buried in a droop, the Flames reviewed Fleury on January 1, 1989, in the expectation he could support their offense. He played his first NHL amusement against the Quebec Nordiques two evenings later and recorded his first focuses â three helps â on January 5 against the Los Angeles Kings. He scored his initial two NHL objectives in a 7â 2 triumph over the Edmonton Oilers on January 7. Fleury kept on scoring, and completed with 34Â points in 36Â games in his NHL freshman season.

He recorded 17 points in ten recreations before the NHL's work question was settled, taking him back to Calgary. Late in the season, Fleury recorded two objectives and a help against the Oilers on March 31, 1995, to outperform 500Â career focuses. 

Coming up short on an agreement preceding the 1995â 96 season, Fleury arranged a concise hold-out amid preparing camp before marking a five-year, $12Â million manage the Flames. He consented to take less cash than he could have gotten on the open market out of dependability to the establishment that had given him his NHL opportunity. He missed a great part of the pre-season with a stomach sickness, yet joined the group for the season opener. In spite of the fact that he felt like someone was "cutting a blade in [his] gut like clockwork", Fleury had played each amusement for the Flames when he uncovered in December 1995 that he had been determined to have Crohn's sickness and specialists had at last discovered the right drug to control it. In spite of the disease, Fleury drove the group in objectives, helps and focuses, and played in his third All-Star Game, filling in as Calgary's solitary delegate. 

At the point when Joe Nieuwendyk would not answer to the Flames preceding the 1995 season, they named Fleury break chief. The title was made lasting when Nieuwendyk was exchanged December. Fleury was hesitant to expect the captaincy, yet did as such out of faithfulness to the group and in light of the fact that there was no one else equipped for taking on the job.

His notoriety was to such an extent that amid a diversion in 1999, after Fleury was sent off the ice to change a ridiculous shirt, a fan tossed his very own keepsake pullover over the sheets so that Fleury would not miss a move. He put the pullover on before acknowledging it was signed and gave it back. 

The exchange was seen as another sign that little market Canadian groups could never again contend in the NHL. The financial matters of hockey had changed to such an extent that the Flames felt that they needed to bargain their top player regardless of being only two out of a playoff spot. Following the exchange, Fleury said that any group hoping to sign him to another agreement would need to pay him $7Â million every year. In his personal history, "Behaving recklessly", Fleury claims that he was offered $16Â million more than four years by the Flames before the exchange, and countered with an idea of $25Â million more than five years.

Fleury played his first amusement for the Thunder on January 22, 2005, scoring an objective and two helps. 

Fleury stayed involved in debate at the 2005 Allan Cup competition. The Thunder were over and over blamed for paying players regardless of being a beginner group, and Fleury irately denied bits of gossip that he was covertly being paid $100,000.
