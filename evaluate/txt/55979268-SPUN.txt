Emesa protective cap 

The Emesa protective cap (otherwise called the Homs head protector) is a Roman mounted force cap from the early first century AD. It comprises of an iron head piece and face veil, the last of which is canvassed in a sheet of silver and introduces the individualized representation of a face, likely its proprietor. Beautifications, some of which are overlaid, embellish the head piece. Seized by Syrian police not long after thieves found it in the midst of a complex of tombs in the advanced city of Homs in 1936, the head protector was in the long run altogether reestablished at the British Museum, and is currently in the gathering of the National Museum of Damascus. It has been displayed universally, in spite of the fact that starting at 2017, because of the Syrian Civil War, the more important things possessed by the National Museum are covered up in underground stockpiling. 

Lavishly structured yet profoundly useful, the head protector was presumably planned for the two processions and fight. Its sensitive covering is too delicate to even consider having been put to use amid mounted force competitions, however the thick iron center would have safeguarded against blows and bolts. Thin cuts for the eyes, with three little gaps underneath to permit descending sight, yielded vision for security; generally cut indents beneath each eye propose a quickly made change of need. 

The cap was found in a tomb close to a landmark to a previous leader of Emesa and, thinking about the extravagance of the silver and gold plan, likely had a place with an individual from the Ã©lite. As it is designed according to those protective caps utilized in Roman competitions, regardless of whether far-fetched to have ever been worn in one, it might have been skilled by a Roman authority to a Syrian general or, almost certain, produced in Syria after the Roman style. The acanthus scroll ornamentation seen on the neck watch reviews that utilized on Syrian sanctuaries, proposing that the protective cap may have been made in the extravagance workshops of Antioch. 

The Emesa protective cap is made of iron and comprises of two sections: a head piece and a face veil. The head piece, which incorporates a neck protect, is made of one bit of iron and connected enhancements. Appended to it are silver beautifications, some of which are overlaid in entire or to some degree: a diadem, a roundabout brow rosette, a portion of metal filling in as a peak, two ear monitors, and a beautifying plate over the neck protect. The ear watches are each appended by three bolts, the top and base of which help hold the diadem and brightening plate, separately, to the head piece; the edges of the diadem and plate are collapsed over the iron center for extra help. The face cover dangles from the head piece by a focal pivot, and would be affixed with ties interfacing a circle under every ear with comparing openings in the neck watch. The whole protective cap, the iron center of which is somewhere in the range of 1 and 6 millimeters thick, gauges , of which the face cover involves . 

The head piece is made of iron, presently rusted. The top contains an imprint, and demonstrates the rusted impression of what used to be a woven and likely vivid or designed texture. From ear to ear around the brow runs an overlaid diadem in the picture of a shrub wreath, a customary image of triumph. Each side contains thirteen components, every one of three leaves and two berries. The leaves are worked in repoussÃ©, and emerge in solid alleviation with about straight dividers. Over the focal point of the diadem is a rosette; it demonstrates a blossom with two lines, every one of six petals, and an external beaded fringe. The beading and the external line of petals are in white silver, standing out from the overlaying of the internal column, the foundation, and the focal bolt securing the rosette to the head piece. A limited fluted strip filling in as a peak, smooth silver with beaded edges, keeps running down the center of the head piece from the rosette to the neck monitor. The relative straightforwardness and mediocrity of artisanship communicated by the peak and rosette may reflect fixes made locally, far from the extravagance workshops of Antioch; not at all like with the diadem, for instance, the foundation of the rosette was not painstakingly punched down, however was straightened with a rounded instrument and now exhibits as a progression of rings. 

The neck watch, flared outward to ensure the shoulders, is secured with an embellishing plate comprising of three level structures. At the top, over the base of the skull, an expansive torus of ivy leaves is circumscribed by lines; the ivy is plated, however the lines are most certainly not. In the center, a smooth and inward transitional zone compares to the empty of the neck. At the last, an acanthus rinceau, or scroll, is mixed with winged creatures and butterflies. Parts of the base ornamentation are plated, giving the protective cap, with all its silver, gold, and iron segments, a polychrome appearance. The ear watches infringe marginally on the base structure, proposing that it was not made explicitly for the protective cap. 

The face veil is made of iron, and secured with a sheet of silver. The focal pivot from which it hangs is made of three sections: an iron cylinder welded to the inside head piece with an outside silver cylinder, an indented silver cylinder fixed to the face veil that wraps the initial segment, and a stick which goes through both and has a silver handle at each end. The cover is molded as a human face. Openings are penetrated between the lips and as nostrils; the eyes each have a limited cut, with three gaps in a trefoil structure, two round gaps outside and a heart-molded gap in the center, underneath each eye to take into account a more noteworthy scope of vision. These evidently were insufficient, for a little and simple indent was cut into every one of the heart-formed gaps to build the wearer's vision. The cover is roughly 2 millimeters thick, of which the silver, which is collapsed around both the edges and each gap to hold it to the iron, represents somewhere in the range of .25 and .5 millimeters. 

Particular highlights spread the face veil. The nose is long and plump with a conspicuous knock, and expands high between the eyes. The cheekbones are low yet noticeable, and the little mouth, which hangs toward the evil side, demonstrates a thick lower lip. Different highlightsâthe eyes and eyebrows, and the jawlineâare increasingly regular. The unmistakable highlights recommend that the producer of the Emesa head protector endeavored to interpret a portion of the individual attributes of the wearer's face into the cap. 

The Emesa head protector is exceedingly practical, and was likely made for the two motorcades and fight. It is thick and overwhelming, which would have offered assurance against substantial blows or bolts, the previous of which may have caused the scratch on the head piece. Incredibly limited eye-cuts likewise demonstrate care taken to build security; the harsh way in which the openings underneath were augmented is likely the outcome of a crisis requiring a superior field of vision. Albeit delegated a mounted force sports head protector, the sort worn in equestrian showcases and competitions known as the "hippika gymnasia", it was probably not going to have been utilized in such occasions. Competition protective caps were strong and produced without artfulness, to withstand the rigors of challenge sound. The fragile ornamentation of the Emesa protective cap, paradoxically, would have been harmed effectively, and in this manner recommends that it would have just been exposed to such dangers in the excellent condition of fight. 

The protective cap was found by pillagers in August 1936, in the cutting edge city of Homs. Known as Emesa toward the beginning of the principal century AD, the city was at the eastern edge of the Roman Empire, and controlled by the Emesene line, a customer kingdom of the Romans. Almost 2,000 years after the fact, the thievesâburrowing close to the previous site of a landmark to Sampsigeramusâfound a complex of rich tombs, and evacuated the grave products. Their plundering was revealed in light of the fact that little brilliant plaques, enhancing the entombment cover of the body in tomb 11, chipped off when bothered. The following morning, kids saw these gold chips blended in with the earth and conveyed them to a bazaar, where it went to the consideration of the police; it at last prompted the capture of the thieves, and the seizure of the grave items. The items, including the protective cap, were then verified for the state accumulation by Emir Djaafar Abd el-Kader, custodian of the National Museum of Damascusâeven as shippers, anxious to gain by the tales, sold current imitations and inconsequential old articles said to originate from the tombs of Emesa. 

The brief intercession of el-Kader, who researched the finds and investigated the thieves, enabled the observes to be recouped and surely knew. He likewise driven further unearthings, as did the French archeologists Daniel Schlumberger and Henri Seyrig. The tomb in which the head protector was discoveredâmarked tomb number 1, of the 22 in the complexâwas a hollowed grave with two chambers, one upper and one lower. The lower chamber, comprising the best possible tomb, had soil for a story and shake for dividers; it gauged , and was high. Somewhere in the range of five and seven disintegrated basalt pillars were set over the opening interfacing the lower chamber with the upper, which was then inlayed to surface dimension. 

Tomb 1 incorporated a rich collection of articles. Just as the protective cap, it contained a gold funerary veil; a gold and turquoise arm ornament; a fancy gold ring with an imperial bust in help; a gold ring with carnelian intaglio; a gold appliquÃ© with a sheep's head and a feathered creature's head; a star-molded fibula; a gold snare; a little tongue of gold; a lead brightened with gold; a silver vase; and a triangle of glass. The raiders may have been off base in likewise ascribing 19 gold plaques to the tomb, as these were apparently indistinguishable to those from tomb 11. Designs from the stone coffin included fragmentary silver rings; 22 gold leaves in repoussÃ©; six covers of Medusa; four square shapes embellished with a lion; four Victories; and eight busts of Apollo. As per Mohammed Moghrabi, who plundered tomb 1, the head protector was found beside the skull. 

After its disclosure, the Emesa head protector experienced a few ineffective rebuilding efforts. The essential issue was the oxidization of the iron center, which made rankles and breaks in the silver covering. Following revelation, the cap was sent to Paris for reclamation by "MM. AndrÃ© pÃ¨re et fils"; just light work was completed because of the expectation that the Syrian atmosphere would help moderate the rate of oxidization, and because of constrained assets, yet the head protector kept on falling apart. By 1952, the protective cap was depicted as being fundamentally more harmed than it had been when unearthed, and in critical need of further work. It was in the end taken to the British Museum, where a last rebuilding was done in 1955. This was finished by Herbert Maryon, who, in 1946, had reproduced the Anglo-Saxon Sutton Hoo head protector. In 1956, a record of the procedure was distributed by Harold Plenderleith, manager of the exhibition hall's exploration lab. Examination observed the silver to be weak, with breaks that had been filled in by a dull halting substance. The iron behind the face veil had rusted, putting further weight on the silver and constraining the airs out by as much as . The face veilâhung on by wire, as the pivot had disengagedâwas subsequently expelled from the head protector to be chipped away at. 

The rusted iron was curtailed of the face veil around the mouth and jaw, where the bends were most noteworthy. To reinforce the silver enough that it could be controlled, the cover was put in an electric heater, and the temperature raised to more than three hours; darkened rust was then expelled by brushing the veil with 9% oxalic corrosive, before warming it once more, for eighteen hours at and at for thirteen. The silver was then cleaned once more, on the two sides, with silver bandage briefly bound over the splits in the back to enable the front to be cleaned down. The dressing was expelled, the silver controlled to close the breaks, and new cloth introduced, forever, utilizing delicate bind. Dainty lines of patch appearing through the shut splits were disguised with a surface covering of connected silver. At last, the iron that had been evacuated to uncover the back of the silver was cleaned and set back in position. In spite of the fact that a couple of makes stayed obvious higher laugh out loud on the face cover, they were shut, as the iron behind them was sound and not applying weight, yet would need to be expelled for reclamation to happen. 

After rebuilding at the British Museum, the head protector was shown in the exhibition hall's King Edward Gallery as a month-long credit from 25 April 1955, at that point came back to Damascus. From 1999 to 2002 the head protector was a piece of a voyaging display, "Syria: Land of Civilizations", with stops in Switzerland, Canada, and the United States. In 2017 the National Museum revived in the wake of shutting amid the Syrian Civil War, however with the more significant items still covered up in underground stockpiling. 

The cap is dated to the main portion of the primary century AD, in view of the style of the acanthus look on the back of the protective cap, and different items found with the head protector and in the tombs adjacent. It is the most punctual known Roman protective cap with a face veil, and is comprehensively named a mounted force sports head protectorâtype D, as per the typology set forward by H. Russell Robinson. Type D protective caps are described by a solitary even pivot connecting the face cover to the head piece, and by head pieces that are brightened to speak to caps. A few kind D precedents exist, for example, the Nijmegen protective cap, however not at all like these, the Emesa head protector was presumably never planned for wearing use. It might rather have been given as a blessing by a Roman authority to a general of the decision group of Emesa, or fabricated in Syria to the similarity of head protectors seen amid Roman competitions. The last condition is thought more probable, for the acanthus ornamentation takes after that seen on Syrian sanctuaries. The cap may in this manner have been dispatched from the workshops of Antioch, known for their extravagance.
