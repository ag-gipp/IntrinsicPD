The first program was described by Bill Nighy, with the portrayal redubbed by Mike Goldman for the Australian airings and Sean Astin for the American communicates. The fourth arrangement, subtitled "The Next Generation", saw Stockard Channing supplanting Astin as the storyteller in the American naming. 

"Meerkat Manor" debuted in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2005, and the initial 13-scene arrangement finished up on 24 October 2005. With the achievement of the program in the United Kingdom, Animal Planet began broadcasting it on its national diverts in Australia, Canada, and the US.

In August 2009, it was accounted for that the program had been dropped. 

In spite of the fact that the show confronted analysis from watchers for not interceding when a meerkat was harmed and confronted demise, in general, "Meerkat Manor" delighted in impressive achievement and was Animal Planet's top arrangement in October 2007, both on the link channel and through its video-on-request administration. The show's exploratory organization broke new ground in creature narrative shooting methods and permitted watchers a long haul, cozy investigate the lives of its meerkat stars, breaking the customary divider among watcher and subject found with generally documentaries. In 2007, "Meerkat Manor" was assigned for two Primetime Emmy Awards. It has won three honors at the 2006 Omni Awards, and at the 2006 and 2007 New York Festivals Award Galas. The initial three arrangement of the program have been discharged to DVD in both Region 1 and Region 2. In 2007, a book entitled "Meerkat Manor â The Story of Flower of the Kalahari" was discharged in the UK, specifying the life of Flower and the Whiskers before the arrangement's recording started. A TV film, "", recording Flower's introduction to the world and ascend to female authority of the Whiskers broadcast on Animal Planet on 25 May 2008. 

"Meerkat Manor" was made via Caroline Hawkins, official maker and arrangement editorial manager at Oxford Scientific Films, and authorized for Animal Planet International by official maker and charging proofreader Mark Wild. Taping for a 13-scene arrangement took seven to eight months, and was constrained to the Kalahari spring and summer seasons, as meerkats are less dynamic amid winter. Arrangement three was recorded from November 2006 through April 2007, and Series four started shooting in October 2007. Most scenes were taped on area at the Kuruman River Reserve, where the Kalahari Meerkat Project that the meerkats are a piece of is based. In any case, the meerkats found in ads and on the show's site were not similar creatures depicted in "Meerkat Manor". Rather, more manageable protected meerkats from the Fellow Earthlings' Wildlife Center were shot against a green screen. 

The show was essentially shot utilizing Sony DSR-570 cameras, albeit exceptional hardware was required for some remarkable film. For scenes inside the creatures' tunnels, small scale fiber-optic infra-red cameras were utilized; wide-edge shots were taped with a seven-meter crane and a remote-controlled camera stage. An off-camera remote mouthpiece was likewise used to record numerous meerkat vocalizations, just in part capable of being heard to cameras' ready frameworks. Most recording was finished by a solitary cameraman and a solitary sound specialist; analysts have required an insignificant human nearness to abstain from focusing on the creatures. Eye-level shots were hard to accomplish on occasion, because of the meerkats' little size and the restricted stature of even the littlest tripods. 

For following purposes by the specialists, the overwhelming female of each gathering is fitted with a radio neckline, similar to some prevailing and wandering guys. The meerkats â particularly more youthful creatures â are set apart with color to separate them. As the meerkats are habituated, they would will in general disregard the camera team as long as their "own space" was regarded. 

The UK and US adaptations of the show have a similar substance for most scenes; nonetheless, the last was now and again altered for length to take into account progressively business breaks. Content was additionally some of the time modified; mating scenes specifically were regularly expelled from the US variant. Creature Planet US every so often changed the names of meerkats and scene titles. Two of Flower's little guys were renamed from Ren and Stumpy to Len and Squiggy; the title of the scene was likewise changed. De la Soul (named for the rap gathering of a similar name), one of the sisters who began the Starsky gathering, was renamed Whoopi in the US as a tribute to performing artist Whoopi Goldberg, an early fanatic of the arrangement. Creature Planet US has additionally renamed a portion of Flower's puppies conceived in season three to respect two different acclaimed aficionados of the show, Elizabeth Taylor and Denis Leary. A few scenes were renamed: the title of the last scene of the second arrangement was transformed from "The Killing Fields" to "The Quiet Fields". Amid the third arrangement, the third scene's title was transformed from "Something's Got to Give" to "Sister Act" (another Goldberg reference), while the 6th scene's title transformed from "The House of Zappa" to "Kin Rivalry". 

The show pursues a few gatherings of meerkats, who act collectively to assist the gatherings in which they live. These gatherings are commonly driven by an overwhelming female and male, who keep up practically selective rights to have posterity. The gathering pursued most intently is known as the Whiskers family. This gathering was picked due to its authority Flower, a surprisingly effective prevailing female who drove the gathering for a long time. Amid arrangement three, Flower kicked the bucket from a snake chomp and was prevailing by her little girl Rocket Dog. 

Creatures in neighboring gatherings were featured in every arrangement also. In the primary arrangement, a gathering called the Lazuli were appeared in rivalry with the Whiskers family, and the opening credits alluded to them as the "neighbors from damnation". In spite of the fact that their overwhelming male Big Si passed on between arrangement, the Lazuli showed up in the second arrangement, generally as a wellspring of wandering guys. Another gathering called the Commandoes, driven by a one-peered toward male named Hannibal, presented themselves by assaulting the Lazuli tunnel, executing a little guy and severely injuring the keeping an eye on. The Commandoes turned into the new real adversaries in the zone, slaughtering the little guys of ousted Whiskers female Mozart and assuming control over a portion of the Whiskers' domain. 

The Whiskers' new neighbors were the Zappa and the Starsky. Albeit littler than the Whiskers, the Zappa assaulted much of the time, and when they fled after one assault, the Whiskers â in an uncommon event â received a relinquished Zappa puppy. The Starsky gathering, then again, was no danger to the Whiskers. Framed by a trio of Flower's girls for all time expelled from the Whiskers, the little gathering was attacked by sickness, predators, and an absence of new puppies. The continually battling Starsky capitulated in the penultimate scene, with the demise of the last survivor, Mozart, who was murdered by a jackal. Previous Whiskers female Maybelline split far from the gathering toward the finish of the third arrangement, shaping another gathering called the Aztecs which turned into the Whiskers' adversaries in the fourth arrangement. 

While the show depicts genuine occasions among the Kalahari Meerkats, it likewise expels tedious components of the creatures' lives. Since numerous days are loaded up with conduct identified with preparing and scrounging, these schedules were regularly let well enough alone for the show for increasingly bizarre occasions. 

The meerkats are altogether named by Kalahari Meerkat volunteers; the person who first observes another litter rise up out of the tunnel is granted naming rights. This has created an assortment of names, every now and again drawn from volunteers' most loved books, films, melodic gatherings, family and companions, chronicled figures and geological areas. Creature Planet once in a while renamed the meerkats for portrayal, contending that analysts' names were excessively constrained, regularly identifying with flavors and sustenance fixings. Due to these changes, aficionados of the arrangement who look for data on the Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project site once in a while experience difficulty finding specific creatures. The task has made a rundown of adjustments to enable watchers to interface the creatures on the show to their genuine partners, and to coordinate scenes to the month to month KMP Life History reports. The rundown, be that as it may, is just accessible to paying individuals from their site. 

Two of the significant Whiskers family matches were composites, made with film and mixed stories from different gatherings. For instance, the Commandoes assemble on the show utilizes some of occasions from the genuine Commandoes gathering, however was principally appeared with film from the Vivian examine gathering â including its prevailing couple. Thus, the show's Zappa assemble was for the most part exhibited utilizing film from a gathering called "The Young Ones" (named after the British network show); notwithstanding, the real story and prevailing pair were from the genuine Zappa Group. Axel, the surrendered little guy from arrangement three, has an exploration number that demonstrates he was likely a Young Ones puppy, as opposed to being a Zappa as the show claims. 

"Meerkat Manor" has been generally welcomed by watchers and pundits alike. In October 2007, it was Animal Planet's top arrangement, with a group of people of in excess of four million in the United States alone. In the United States, its first scene was seen by one million watchers, and the second and third arrangement debuts were viewed by around 800,000 watchers each. The fourth arrangement debut did not toll too, with less than 500,000 watchers. The viewership of the on-request video contributions for "Meerkat Manor" became 20% in September 2007, when Discovery offered every third arrangement scene, video cases of arrangement one and two, top ten minutes from the show, and a remembrance succession for Flower. Expanding on the achievement of "Meerkat Manor's" interesting configuration, Animal Planet charged two also arranged projects: "Orangutan Island", which centers around a gathering of stranded orangutans at the Nyaru Menteng Orangutan Rescue and Rehabilitation Center, and "Lemur Street", which takes a gander at the lives of two adversary packs of ring-followed lemurs in Madagascar. 

A few fans have scrutinized the show for its non-impedance arrangement with respect to the meerkats, inquiring as to why the film team and scientists don't give neutralizing agent venom to wind nibbled meerkats, or euthanize those withering and enduring. US Executive Producer Mick Kaczorowski called attention to that "Meerkat Manor" was a show about the genuine lives and passings of the meerkats. The examination assemble has an arrangement against film teams intervening in characteristic occasions "since they would prefer not to affect the quality pool by sparing a more fragile meerkat [or] influencing the result of what's normal in the Kalahari." As the exploration venture is checking "...the rearing achievement and survival of people and ... the elements that influence multiplication and survival" meddling in the common procedures would render the exploration results invalid. There is one special case to this standard: scientists will euthanize meerkats that agreement tuberculosis, to counteract episodes that would compromise both the meerkat populace and close-by dairy cattle. 

"Meerkat Manor" was named for a 2005 Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival Award in the "Creature Behavior" class, and in 2007 for "Best Original Score". At the 2006 Wildscreen Festival, the arrangement was a finalist in three classifications: "Creature Behavior", "Advancement", and "Prevalent Broadcast". The arrangement won Gold Statues in "Normal History" and "Cinematography", and a Silver Statue for "Composing", at the 2006 Omni Awards. The eighth scene of arrangement three, "Voyage's End" which delineates the passing of Whiskers matron Flower, was granted the 2008 Wildscreen Festival Panda Award in the "Five Award for Popular Broadcast Program" class. "Meerkat Manor" was a two-time Gold Medal victor in the "Nature and Wildlife" classification at the New York Festivals Award Gala, in 2006 for arrangement one, and again in 2007 for arrangement one and two. The arrangement was assigned for two Primetime Emmy Awards in 2007: one for "Remarkable Cinematography for Nonfiction Programming" and one for "Exceptional Picture Editing for Nonfiction Programming". In 2009 the arrangement was granted the Grand Award at the New York Festivals International Television Programming and Promotion Awards in the "Family Programs" classification. 

"Meerkat Manor's" inventive new techniques for shooting permitted the Kalahari Project researchers an opportunity to reveal parts of meerkat life at no other time seen, including life inside the tunnels. The film team was likewise the first to catch meerkat child murder on film. 

While numerous documentaries keep up an enthusiastic separation from their subjects, "Meerkat Manor" â because of its all-encompassing length, cleanser musical show like portrayal, romanticization of the creatures' lives, and close-up recording procedures, gives a closer, progressively close to home perspective on the meerkats. Watchers depict being candidly engaged with the creatures' lives, once in a while overlooking they are viewing a narrative. The meerkats' much of the time short lives and ruthless passings become astounding and exasperating to certain gatherings of people. This trial design was viewed as extending the limits of both the nature narrative sort and the idea of unscripted television. 

A book composed by Professor Tim Clutton-Brock entitled "Meerkat Manor: The Story of Flower of the Kalahari" () was discharged in the UK in a hardback release on 4 October 2007. The book centers around Flower's life and the narrative of the Whiskers, following how the gathering began, giving a course of events of Flower's life, and itemizing the majority of the little guys she had over her lifetime, just as their present areas. The book additionally gives more foundation on how the Kalahari Meerkat Project began, the exploration objectives and results, and scientists' close to home lives. A soft cover version of the book was reported for discharge in the United States by Simon and Schuster through their Touchstone engrave on 15 April 2008. The US discharge was titled "Meerkat Manor: Flower of the Kalahari" (). In November 2007, Discovery Communications declared that it was banding together with Activision to make a computer game dependent on "Meerkat Manor" as the first in another arrangement of nature-based amusements. The declaration expressed the amusement would be discharged to numerous stages in late 2008, however no diversion was ever discharged. 

Oxford Scientific Films created a component film for Discovery Films that goes about as a prequel to the "Meerkat Manor" arrangement. Initially declared as "Blossom: Queen of the Kalahari", "Meerkat Manor: The Story Begins" was coordinated by Chris Barker and Mike Slee and described by Whoopi Goldberg. The film records Flower's initial life as she develops from a youthful meerkat to end up a standout amongst the best chiefs of the Whiskers family. The film was presented at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival in the Spotlight area, and afterward broadcast in the United States on Animal Planet on 25 May 2008 as a lead-in to a thirty-minute "Creation of Meerkat Manor: the Story Begins" extraordinary. It was discharged to Region 1 DVD in North America on 3 June 2008, with the "Creation of Meerkat Manor" exceptional, and another uncommon, "The Science of Meerkat Manor", included as additional items. 

The film included re-altered film and another melodic score. The Whiskers story was disentangled, with the Lazuli being the main adversary gathering to show up in the film. Dissimilar to with the "Meerkat Manor" arrangement, the film does not really delineate any of the genuine Whiskers meerkats. Untrained "meerkat performing artists" assume the job of Flower and her family, with the camera team looking out suitably matured meerkats, at that point tailing them until the meerkats acted in a way that was required for the film. Blossom herself was portrayed by around eight female meerkats.
