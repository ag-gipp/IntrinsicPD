Generally the job of French rugby mentor (or "coach") has fluctuated impressively. Because of the status of rugby association as a beginner sport for the vast majority of its history, the activity of choosing strategies and running group trainings has frequently been that of the chief or senior players. In this manner, a far reaching rundown of national mentors is unimaginable. 

Despite the fact that trained by Jean Desclaux somewhere in the range of 1973 and 1980, the French group's fundamental impact amid the late 1970 was chief Jacques Fouroux. Fouroux played scrum-half and captained France to their 1977 Five Nations Grand Slam, amid which France played an exceptionally forward-arranged style of rugby. In spite of the fact that the style of "Fouroux's Gang" was effective, it was reprimanded on the grounds that it appeared differently in relation to the conventional open assaulting style of French rugby.

Laporte guided France through the 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups before venturing down to progress toward becoming Secretary of State for Sport. After Philippe Saint-AndrÃ© turned down the idea to supplant Laporte, French Rugby Federation president Bernard Lapasset designated Marc LiÃ¨vremont to control France to the 2011 World Cup. LiÃ¨vremont's residency as mentor was set apart by conflicting and bewildering squad choice decisions, and player discontent. There were some brilliant minutes, prominently wins against New Zealand in Dunedin and South Africa in Toulouse, and the 2010 Six Nations Grand Slam. Yet, there was likewise a 59â 16 misfortune to Australia in Paris, a 22â 21 misfortune to Italy in the 2011 Six Nations, and a 19â 14 misfortune to Tonga amid the 2011 World Cup. In August 2011, preceding the World Cup, it was reported that Philippe Saint-AndrÃ© would supplant LiÃ¨vremont and guide France to the 2015 World Cup. This did not shock LiÃ¨vremont, as he had declared as ahead of schedule as May 2010 that he would not proceed as the mentor of France after the World Cup. 

France did not awe under Saint-AndrÃ©, completing no higher than fourth in the Six Nations amid his residency and notwithstanding guaranteeing the wooden spoon in 2013. Following the 2015 Six Nations, he declared his renunciation viable after that year's World Cup and was supplanted by Guy NovÃ¨s. France was even less amazing under NovÃ¨s, with "Les Bleus" winning less than 33% of their matches amid his residency, topped off by a keep running of seven winless matches. NovÃ¨s was rejected in December 2017, turning into the primary France head mentor ever to be terminated before the finish of his agreement, and was supplanted by previous Italy head mentor Jacques Brunel, who touched base from a similar position with Bordeaux BÃ¨gles. NovÃ¨s' partners were rejected also.
