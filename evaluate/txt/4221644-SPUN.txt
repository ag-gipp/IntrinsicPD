North Road was a football and cricket ground in Newton Heath, Manchester, England. It was the primary home of Manchester United Football Club â at that point known as Newton Heath Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Football Club â from its establishment in 1878 until 1893, when the club moved to another ground at Bank Street, Clayton. 

At first the ground comprised just of the pitch, around which an expected 12,000Â spectators could gather. The expansion of stands in 1891 expanded the ability to around 15,000. The football club marked its first expert players in 1886 and started to part from its supporting railroad organization, yet without the organization's money related help it was unfit to bear the cost of the lease on the ground and was removed. 

Following the establishment of Newton Heath LYR F.C., in line with the representatives of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) organization's Carriage and Wagon Works, the club required a pitch to play on. The picked site was possessed by the Manchester Cathedral specialists, yet albeit helpfully sited alongside the wagon works it was a "rough, stony fix in summer, [and] a sloppy, substantial bog in the blustery months". The railroad organization consented to pay an ostensible lease to the experts and to rent the ground to the football club. As it was by the railroad line worked by the LYR, the ground was frequently blurred in a thick fog of steam from passing trains. Players needed to get changed in TheÂ ThreeÂ Crowns open house, a couple of hundred yards away on Oldham Road, as there were no offices close-by. There may have been some sort of refreshment offered to supporters at the eastern end of the site. 

The main recorded matches at the ground occurred in 1880, two years after the club's arrangement, the vast majority of them friendlies.

Football turned into a pro game in England in 1885, and Newton Heath marked their first expert players in the late spring of 1886. The club's pay was lacking to cover its pay bill, thus the 3d affirmation charge was reached out to all matches played at North Road, later ascending to 6d. 

The ground initially had a limit of around 12,000, however club authorities concluded that was insufficient to give them any desire for joining the Football League. Some development occurred in 1887, yet in 1891 Newton Heath utilized what minimal money related stores they needed to buy two grandstands, each ready to hold 1,000Â spectators. Be that as it may, this exchange put the club inconsistent with the railroad organization, who would not contribute any fund to the arrangement. The two associations started to float separated from that point onwards, and in 1892 the club endeavored to bring Â£2,000 up in offer funding to satisfy the obligations brought about by the development of the ground. The split additionally drove the railroad organization to quit paying the lease due on the ground to the house of prayer, who at about a similar time chose to build the lease. Under expanding monetary weight, particularly as the house of God experts felt it unseemly for the club to charge admission to the ground, a removal see was served on the club in June 1893. The club's administration had been scanning for another arena since the primary expulsion endeavor in May the earlier year, and they had the capacity to move to another ground on Bank Street, three miles away in Clayton. It demonstrated unimaginable however to take the two grandstands to the new ground, and they were sold for Â£100.

In any case, the cricket and football seasons frequently covered, causing clashes between the two games. The ground was scarcely sufficient for football, in spite of the best endeavors of groundsmen Charlie and Ned Massey, yet its utilization in the winter made it even less reasonable for cricket in the mid year.

A comparative participation was likewise recorded for an amicable match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889. A record-low group participation of roughly 1,000 was recorded for Football Alliance matches against Walsall Town Swifts and Birmingham City on 21 April 1890 and 13 December 1890 separately. Be that as it may, a participation of 400 was recorded for a Manchester Cup coordinate against Eccles on 31 January 1885.
