ÃthelflÃ¦d 

ÃthelflÃ¦d, Lady of the Mercians ( 870 â 12 June 918) ruled Mercia in the English Midlands from 911 until her demise. She was the oldest little girl of Alfred the Great, lord of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, and his better half Ealhswith. ÃthelflÃ¦d was conceived around 870 at the tallness of the Viking intrusions of England. By 878, the greater part of England was under Danish Viking rule â East Anglia and Northumbria having been vanquished, and Mercia divided between the English and the Vikings â however in that year Alfred won a urgent triumph at the Battle of Edington. Before long a short time later the English-controlled western portion of Mercia went under the standard of Ãthelred, Lord of the Mercians, who acknowledged Alfred's overlordship. Alfred received the title King of the English, professing to lead every single English individuals not living in regions under Viking control. In the mid-880s, Alfred fixed the vital collusion between the enduring English kingdoms by wedding ÃthelflÃ¦d to Ãthelred. 

Ãthelred assumed a noteworthy job in warding off recharged Viking assaults during the 890s, together with ÃthelflÃ¦d's sibling, the future King Edward the Elder. Ãthelred and ÃthelflÃ¦d sustained Worcester, gave liberal gifts to Mercian houses of worship and fabricated another minster in Gloucester. Ãthelred's wellbeing most likely declined right off the bat in the following decade, after which almost certainly, ÃthelflÃ¦d was fundamentally in charge of the legislature of Mercia. Edward had prevailing as King of the Anglo-Saxons in 899, and in 909 he sent a West Saxon and Mercian power to strike the northern Danelaw. They came back with the remaining parts of the imperial Northumbrian holy person, Oswald, which were meant the new Gloucester minster. Ãthelred kicked the bucket in 911 and ÃthelflÃ¦d then controlled Mercia as Lady of the Mercians. The increase of a female ruler in Mercia is depicted by the student of history Ian Walker as "a standout amongst the most one of a kind occasions in early medieval history". 

Alfred had manufactured a system of sustained burhs and during the 910s Edward and ÃthelflÃ¦d set out on a program of expanding them. Among the towns where she fabricated safeguards were Bridgnorth, Tamworth, Stafford, Warwick, Chirbury and Runcorn. In 917 she sent a military to catch Derby, the first of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw to tumble to the English, a triumph depicted by Tim Clarkson as "her most noteworthy triumph". In 918 Leicester surrendered without a battle. In no time a short time later the Viking chiefs of York offered her their devotion, however she kicked the bucket on 12June 918 preceding she could exploit the offer, and a couple of months after the fact Edward finished the victory of Mercia. ÃthelflÃ¦d was prevailing by her girl Ãlfwynn, however in December Edward assumed moral responsibility for Mercia and stole Ãlfwynn away to Wessex. 

History specialists differ whether Mercia was a free kingdom under Ãthelred and ÃthelflÃ¦d yet they concur that ÃthelflÃ¦d was an extraordinary ruler who had a vital impact in the victory of the Danelaw. She was applauded by Anglo-Norman writers, for example, William of Malmesbury, who portrayed her as "an amazing increase to [Edward's] party, the enjoyment of his subjects, the fear of his foes, a lady of expanded soul". As indicated by Pauline Stafford, "likeÂ ... ElizabethI she turned into a marvel to later ages". In Nick Higham's view, medieval and present day authors have been so enamored by her that Edward's notoriety has endured unjustifiably in examination. 

Mercia was the prevailing kingdom in southern England in the eighth century and kept up its situation until it endured an unequivocal annihilation by Wessex at the Battle of Ellandun in 825. From that point the two kingdoms moved toward becoming partners, which was to be a vital factor in English protection from the Vikings. 

In 865 the Viking Great Heathen Army arrived in East Anglia and utilized this as a beginning stage for an attack. The East Anglians were compelled to purchase harmony and the next year the Vikings attacked Northumbria, where they selected a manikin lord in 867. They at that point proceeded onward Mercia, where they spent the winter of 867â 868. Lord Burgred of Mercia was joined by King Ãthelred of Wessex and his sibling, the future King Alfred, for a consolidated assault on the Vikings, who declined a commitment; at last the Mercians purchased harmony with them. The next year, the Vikings vanquished East Anglia. In 874 the Vikings ousted King Burgred and Ceolwulf turned into the last King of Mercia with their help. In 877 the Vikings parceled Mercia, taking the eastern areas for themselves and permitting Ceolwulf to keep the western ones. He was depicted by the "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle" as "an absurd lord's thegn" who was a manikin of the Vikings. The student of history Ann Williams sees this view as fractional and mutilated, that he was acknowledged as a genuine ruler by the Mercians and by King Alfred. The circumstance was changed the next year when Alfred prevailed upon a definitive triumph the Danes at the Battle of Edington. 

Ceolwulf isn't recorded after 879. His successor as the leader of the English western portion of Mercia, ÃthelflÃ¦d's better half Ãthelred, is first observed in 881 when, as indicated by the student of history of medieval Wales, Thomas Charles-Edwards, he drove an ineffective Mercian attack of the north Welsh Kingdom of Gwynedd. In 883 he made a concede with the assent of King Alfred, hence recognizing Alfred's lordship. In 886 Alfred involved the Mercian town of London, which had been in Viking hands. He at that point got the accommodation of all English not under Viking control and gave control of London over to Ãthelred. During the 890s, Ãthelred and Edward, Alfred's child and future successor, fended off additionally Viking assaults. Alfred kicked the bucket in 899 and Edward's case to the position of authority was questioned by Ãthelwold, child of Alfred's senior sibling. Ãthelwold united with the Vikings when he was unfit to get adequate help in Wessex, and his insubordination just finished with his demise fighting in December 902. 

The most essential hotspot for history in this period is the "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle" yet ÃthelflÃ¦d is nearly disregarded in the standard West Saxon variant, in what F. T. Wainwright calls "a connivance of quietness". He contends that King Edward was on edge not to support Mercian nonconformity and did not wish to advertise his sister's achievements, on the off chance that she turned into an image of Mercian claims. Brief subtleties of her activities were saved in an expert Mercian variant of the "Narrative" known as the "Mercian Register" or the "Records of ÃthelflÃ¦d"; in spite of the fact that it is presently lost, components were fused into a few enduring renditions of the "Annal". The "Register" covers the years 902 to 924, and centers around ÃthelflÃ¦d's activities; Edward is scarcely referenced and her significant other just twice, on his demise and as dad of their girl. Data about ÃthelflÃ¦d's vocation is likewise saved in the Irish annal known as the "Three Fragments". As per Wainwright, it "contains much that is amazing instead of authentic. Be that as it may, it additionally contains, particularly for our period, much veritable verifiable data which appears to have its underlying foundations in a contemporary account." She was lauded by Anglo-Norman writers, for example, William of Malmesbury and John of Worcester and she has gotten more consideration from history specialists than some other common lady in Anglo-Saxon England. 

ÃthelflÃ¦d was conceived around 870, the most established offspring of King Alfred the Great and his Mercian spouse, Ealhswith, who was a little girl of Ãthelred Mucel, ealdorman of the Gaini, one of the clans of Mercia. Ealhswith's mom, Eadburh, was an individual from the Mercian regal house, most likely a relative of King Coenwulf (796â 821). ÃthelflÃ¦d was in this way half-Mercian and the collusion among Wessex and Mercia was fixed by her marriage to Ãthelred, Lord of the Mercians. They are referenced in Alfred's will, which most likely dates to the 880s. ÃthelflÃ¦d, depicted just as "my oldest little girl", got a bequest and 100 mancuses, while Ãthelred, the main ealdorman to be referenced by name, got a sword worth 100 mancuses. ÃthelflÃ¦d was first recorded as Ãthelred's significant other in a contract of 887, when he allowed two bequests to the see of Worcester "with the authorization and sign-manual of King Alfred" and the attestors included "ÃthelflÃ¦d "conjux"". The marriage may have occurred before, maybe when he submitted to Alfred following the recuperation of London in 886. Ãthelred was a lot more seasoned than ÃthelflÃ¦d and they had one known kid, a little girl called Ãlfwynn. Ãthelstan, the oldest child of Edward the Elder and future lord of England, was raised in their court and, in the perspective on Martin Ryan, absolutely joined their battles against the Vikings. 

Ãthelred's plunge is obscure. Richard Abels depicts him as "to some degree a baffling character", who may have asserted imperial blood and been identified with King Alfred's dad in-law, Ealdorman Ãthelred Mucel. In the perspective on Ian Walker: "He was a regal ealdorman whose control base lay in the south-west of Mercia in the previous kingdom of the Hwicce around Gloucester". Alex Woolf proposes that he was most likely the child of King Burgred of Mercia and King Alfred's sister Ãthelswith, despite the fact that that would imply that the marriage among ÃthelflÃ¦d and Ãthelred was uncanonical, in light of the fact that Rome at that point disallowed marriage between first cousins. 

Contrasted with the remainder of England, quite a bit of English MerciaÂ âGloucestershire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire and ShropshireÂ âwas strangely steady in the Viking age. It didn't endure significant assaults and it didn't go under extraordinary weight from Wessex. Mercian grant had high renown at the courts of Alfred and Edward. Worcester had the capacity to safeguard impressive scholarly and formal coherence and, with Gloucester, turned into the focal point of a Mercian restoration under Ãthelred and ÃthelflÃ¦d that reached out into the more precarious regions of Staffordshire and Cheshire. Sanctions demonstrate the Mercian pioneers supporting the restoration by their liberality to devout networks. In 883 Ãthelred conceded benefits to Berkeley Abbey and during the 890s he and ÃthelflÃ¦d issued a sanction for the congregation of Worcester. This was the main event in Alfred's lifetime when they are known to have acted mutually; by and large Ãthelred followed up on his own, generally recognizing the authorization of King Alfred. ÃthelflÃ¦d saw sanctions of Ãthelred in 888, 889 and 896. In 901 ÃthelflÃ¦d and Ãthelred gave land and a brilliant cup gauging thirty mancuses to the holy place of Saint Mildburg at Much Wenlock church. 

Toward the finish of the ninth century, Ãthelred and ÃthelflÃ¦d strengthened Worcester, with the authorization of King Alfred and in line with Bishop Werferth, portrayed in the sanction as "their companion". They allowed the congregation of Worcester a half offer of the privileges of lordship over the city, covering land rents and the returns of equity, and consequently the house of prayer network concurred in interminability to commit a song to them three times each day and a mass and thirty hymns each Saturday. As the privileges of lordship had recently had a place completely with the congregation, this spoke to the start of exchange from episcopal to common control of the city. In 904 Bishop Werferth allowed a rent of land in the city to Ãthelred and ÃthelflÃ¦d, to be held for the length of their lives and that of their little girl Ãlfwynn. The land was significant, including a large portion of the city's usable waterway facing, and control of it empowered the Mercian rulers to overwhelm over and benefit from the city. 

Ãthelred's wellbeing presumably declined at some phase in the decade after Alfred kicked the bucket in 899, and ÃthelflÃ¦d may have turned into the accepted leader of Mercia by 902. As per the "Three Fragments", the Norse (Norwegian) Vikings were ousted from Dublin and after that made an unsuccessful assault on Wales. At the point when this fizzled they connected to ÃthelflÃ¦d, her better half being sick, for authorization to settle close Chester. ÃthelflÃ¦d concurred and for quite a while they were serene. The Norse Vikings at that point united with the Danes in an assault on Chester, yet this fizzled in light of the fact that ÃthelflÃ¦d had braced the town, and she and her significant other induced the Irish among the aggressors to change sides. Different sources affirm that the Norse were driven out of Dublin in 902 and that ÃthelflÃ¦d braced Chester in 907. ÃthelflÃ¦d re-established Chester as a burh and she is accepted to have improved its Roman safeguards by running dividers from the north-west and south-east corners of the fortification to the River Dee. Simon Ward, who exhumed an Anglo-Saxon site in Chester, sees the later thriving of the town as owing a lot to the arranging of ÃthelflÃ¦d and Edward. After ÃthelflÃ¦d's passing, Edward experienced savage protection from his endeavors to solidify his control of the north-west and he kicked the bucket there in 924, not long after smothering a neighborhood insubordination. 

In 909 Edward sent a West Saxon and Mercian power toward the northern Danelaw, where it assaulted for five weeks. The remaining parts of the imperial Northumbrian holy person Oswald were seized and assumed from his resting position in Bardney Abbey in Lincolnshire to Gloucester. In the late ninth century Gloucester had turned into a burh with a road plan like Winchester, and Ãthelred and ÃthelflÃ¦d had fixed its antiquated Roman resistances. In 896 a gathering of the Mercian witan was held in the illustrious corridor at Kingsholm, simply outside the town. The Mercian rulers fabricated another minster in Gloucester and, despite the fact that the structure was little, it was adorned on an excellent scale, with rich figure. It was at first committed to St Peter yet when Oswald's remaining parts were conveyed to Gloucester in 909, ÃthelflÃ¦d had them made an interpretation of from Bardney to the new minster, which was renamed St Oswald's in his respect. The relics gave the congregation incredible esteem as Oswald had been a standout amongst the most critical establishing holy people of Anglo-Saxon Christianity just as a decision ruler, and the choice to make an interpretation of his relics to Gloucester demonstrates the significance of the town to Ãthelred and ÃthelflÃ¦d, who were covered in St Oswald's Minster. Simon Keynes depicts the town as "the principle seat of their capacity" and Carolyn Heighway trusts that the establishment of the congregation was presumably a family and dynastic undertaking, energized by Alfred and upheld by Edward and Bishop Werferth. Heighway and Michael Hare composed: 

Mercia had a long custom of worshiping imperial holy people and this was eagerly upheld by Ãthelred and ÃthelflÃ¦d. Virtuous relics were accepted to give heavenly authenticity to rulers' position, and ÃthelflÃ¦d was most likely in charge of the establishment or re-establishment of Chester Minster and the exchange to it of the remaining parts of the seventh-century Mercian princess Saint Werburgh from Hanbury in Staffordshire. She may likewise have deciphered the relics of the martyred Northumbrian ruler Ealhmund from Derby to Shrewsbury. In 910 the Danes countered against the English assault of the earlier year by attacking Mercia, striking similarly as Bridgnorth in Shropshire. On their way back they were gotten by an English armed force in Staffordshire and their military was pulverized at the Battle of Tettenhall, opening the route for the recuperation of the Danish Midlands and East Anglia throughout the following decade. 

On her better half's demise in 911, ÃthelflÃ¦d progressed toward becoming "Myrcna hlÃ¦dige", "Woman of the Mercians". Ian Walker depicts her progression as the main instance of a female leader of a kingdom in Anglo-Saxon history and "a standout amongst the most extraordinary occasions in early medieval history". In Wessex, imperial ladies were not permitted to assume any political job; Alfred's significant other was not conceded the title of ruler and was never an observer to sanctions. In Mercia, Alfred's sister Ãthelswith had been the spouse of King Burgred of Mercia; she had seen contracts as ruler and had made gives together with her significant other and in her very own name. ÃthelflÃ¦d profited by a Mercian convention of queenly significance, and had the capacity to assume a key job in the historical backdrop of the mid tenth century as Lady of the Mercians, which would not have been conceivable in Wessex. 

At the point when Ãthelred kicked the bucket, Edward assumed responsibility for the Mercian towns of London and Oxford and their hinterlands, which Alfred had put under Mercian control. Ian Walker recommends that ÃthelflÃ¦d acknowledged this loss of region as an end-result of acknowledgment by her sibling of her situation in Mercia. Alfred had built a system of invigorated burhs in Wessex, and Edward and ÃthelflÃ¦d now set out on a program of extending them to solidify their resistances and give bases to assaults on the Vikings. As per Frank Stenton, ÃthelflÃ¦d drove Mercian armed forces on endeavors, which she arranged. He remarked: "It was through dependence on her guardianship of Mercia that her sibling was empowered to start the forward development against the southern Danes which is the exceptional element of his rule". 

ÃthelflÃ¦d had officially sustained an obscure area called "Bremesburh" in 910 and in 912 she assembled resistances at Bridgnorth to cover an intersection of the River Severn. In 913 she assembled fortifications at Tamworth to make preparations for the Danes in Leicester, and in Stafford to cover access from the Trent Valley. In 914 a Mercian armed force drawn from Gloucester and Hereford repulsed a Viking intrusion from Brittany, and the Iron Age Eddisbury slope fortification was fixed to shield against attack from Northumbria or Cheshire, while Warwick was sustained as further security against the Leicester Danes. In 915 Chirbury was invigorated to watch a course from Wales and Runcorn on the River Mersey. Safeguards were worked before 914 at Hereford, and presumably Shrewsbury and two different strongholds, at "Scergeat" and "Weardbyrig", which have not been found. 

In 917 intrusions by three Viking armed forces bombed as ÃthelflÃ¦d sent a military which caught Derby and the region around it. The town was one of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw, together with Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham and Stamford. Derby was the first to tumble to the English; she lost "four of her thegns who were of high repute to her" in the fight. Tim Clarkson, who depicts ÃthelflÃ¦d as "prestigious as an equipped war-pioneer", sees the triumph at Derby as "her most prominent triumph". Toward the year's end, the East Anglian Danes submitted to Edward. In mid 918, ÃthelflÃ¦d picked up ownership of Leicester without resistance and the vast majority of the neighborhood Danish armed force submitted to her. A couple of months after the fact, the main men of Danish-ruled York offered to promise their devotion to ÃthelflÃ¦d, likely to verify her help against Norse bandits from Ireland, however she kicked the bucket on 12 June 918, preceding she could exploit the offer. No comparative offer is known to have been made to Edward. As indicated by the "Three Fragments", in 918 ÃthelflÃ¦d drove a multitude of Scots and Northumbrian English against powers driven by the Norse Viking pioneer Ragnall at the Battle of Corbridge in Northumbria. History specialists consider this far-fetched, yet she may have sent an unforeseen to the fight. The two sides guaranteed triumph yet Ragnall had the capacity to set up himself as leader of Northumbria. In the "Three Fragments", ÃthelflÃ¦d likewise framed a guarded union with the Scots and the Strathclyde British, a case acknowledged by Clarkson. 

Little is known about ÃthelflÃ¦d's relations with the Welsh. The main recorded occasion occurred in 916, when she sent a campaign to retaliate for the homicide of a Mercian abbot and his partners; her men crushed the imperial crannog of Brycheiniog on Llangorse Lake and caught the ruler and thirty-three of her allies. As indicated by a variant of the "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle" firmly thoughtful to Edward the Elder, after ÃthelflÃ¦d's passing "the rulers among the Welsh, Hywel and Clydog and Idwal, and all the Welsh individuals looked to have [Edward] as their master". Hywel Dda was lord of Dyfed in south-west Wales, Clydog ap Cadell most likely ruler of Powys in the north-east, and Idwal abdominal muscle Anarawd lord of Gwynedd in the north-west. Gwent in south-east Wales was at that point under West Saxon lordship at the same time, in the perspective on Charles-Edwards, this section demonstrates that the other Welsh kingdoms were under Mercian lordship until Edward took direct control over Mercia. 

No coins were issued with the name of Ãthelred or ÃthelflÃ¦d on them, however during the 910s silver pennies were printed in west Mercian towns with unordinary decorative structures on the invert and this may want to recognize specie issued under her control from that of her sibling. After her demise, west Mercian coin turns around were again equivalent to those on coins delivered in Wessex. 

ÃthelflÃ¦d kicked the bucket at Tamworth on 12June 918 and her body was conveyed to Gloucester, where she was covered with her significant other in their establishment, St Oswald's Minster. As per the "Mercian Register", ÃthelflÃ¦d was covered in the east porticus. A structure reasonable for an illustrious catacomb has been found by archeological examination at the east end of the congregation and this may have been St Oswald's internment place. Situation by the holy person would have been a renowned entombment area for Ãthelred and ÃthelflÃ¦d. William of Malmesbury composed that their internment places were found in the "south" porticus amid structure works in the early twelfth century. He may have been misled about the position however it is likewise conceivable that the tombs were moved from their esteemed position alongside the holy person, when the couple turned out to be less known after some time or when tenth-century lords acted to limit the respect paid to their Mercian forerunners. 

The decision of entombment place was representative. Victoria Thompson contends that if ÃthelflÃ¦d had picked Edward's illustrious tomb in Winchester as the internment place for her significant other and herself, that would have underscored Mercia's subordinate status, though a customary Mercian regal entombment spot, for example, Repton would have been a provocative affirmation of autonomy; Gloucester, close to the outskirt with Wessex, was a trade off between the two. Martin Ryan sees the establishment as "something like an illustrious tomb, expected to supplant the one at Repton (Derbyshire) that had been obliterated by the Vikings". ÃthelflÃ¦d kicked the bucket a couple of months too soon to see the last triumph of the southern Danelaw by Edward. She was prevailing as Lady of the Mercians by her little girl, Ãlfwynn, yet toward the beginning of December 918 Edward ousted her and took Mercia under his control. Numerous Mercians hated the subjection of their old kingdom to Wessex, and Wainwright depicts the Mercian annalist's portrayal of the affidavit of Ãlfwynn as "overwhelming with disdain". Edward kicked the bucket in 924 at Farndon in Cheshire a couple of days in the wake of putting down a resistance by Mercians and Welshmen at Chester. 

Toward the West Saxon rendition of the "Old English Saxon Chronicle", ÃthelflÃ¦d was just King Edward's sister, though for the "Mercian Register" she was Lady of the Mercians. Irish and Welsh archives depicted her as a ruler and the Annals of Ulster, which disregard the passings of Alfred and Edward, portrayed her as "famosissima regina Saxonum" (famous Saxon ruler). She was likewise applauded by Anglo-Norman students of history, for example, John of Worcester and William of Malmesbury, who depicted her as "a ground-breaking increase to [Edward's] party, the joy of his subjects, the fear of his foes, a lady of extended soul". He asserted that she declined to engage in sexual relations after the introduction of her single tyke since it was "unbecoming of the little girl of a lord to offer route to a joy which, after a period, created such excruciating outcomes". As indicated by Nick Higham, "progressive medieval and current journalists were very charmed by her" and her sibling's notoriety has endured unjustifiably in examination. In the twelfth century, Henry of Huntingdon paid her his own tribute: 

A few students of history trust that Ãthelred and ÃthelflÃ¦d were autonomous rulers. In the "Handbook of British Chronology", David Dumville alludes to "Q. ÃthelflÃ¦d" and remarks, "The titles given her by all sources ("hlÃ¦fdige, regina") infer that she used regal power and expert". Alex Woolf agrees and Pauline Stafford portrays ÃthelflÃ¦d as "the last Mercian ruler", alluded to in sanctions in such terms as "by the endowment of Christ's kindness managing the administration of the Mercians". Stafford contends that Ãthelred and ÃthelflÃ¦d practiced most or the majority of the forces of a ruler after Alfred's demise yet it would have been a provocative demonstration formally to guarantee loftiness, particularly after Ãthelwold's defiance. Stafford considers her to be a "warrior ruler", "LikeÂ ... ElizabethI she turned into a miracle to later ages." According to Charles Insley, 

Wainwright considers ÃthelflÃ¦d to be energetically tolerating a subordinate job in an organization with her sibling and consenting to his arrangement of unification of Wessex and Mercia under his standard. Wainwright contends that he presumably sent his most seasoned child Ãthelstan to be raised in Mercia, to make him progressively satisfactory to the Mercians as lord; ÃthelflÃ¦d does not seem to have endeavored to discover a spouse for her girl, who more likely than not been about thirty by 918. In Wainwright's view, she was disregarded in West Saxon hotspots for dread that acknowledgment of her accomplishments would energize Mercian dissent: 

Simon Keynes calls attention to that all coins were issued in Edward's name, and keeping in mind that the Mercian rulers had the capacity to issue a few contracts alone specialist, others recognized Edward's lordship. In 903 a Mercian ealdorman "appealed to King Edward, and furthermore Ãthelred and ÃthelflÃ¦d, who at that point held rulership and control over the race of the Mercians under the aforementioned lord". Keynes contends that another country was made when Ãthelred submitted to Alfred during the 880s, covering Wessex and English (western) Mercia. In Keynes' view, "the end appears to be certain that the Alfredian commonwealth of the majesty 'of the Anglo-Saxons' continued in the main quarter of the tenth century, and that the Mercians were in this manner under Edward's standard from the earliest starting point of his rule". Ryan trusts that the Mercian rulers "had a significant in any case subordinate offer of imperial specialist". 

In Higham's view, Keynes presents a solid defense that Edward governed over an Anglo-Saxon state with a creating authoritative and ideological solidarity however that ÃthelflÃ¦d and Ãthelred did a lot to energize a different Mercian character, for example, building up religions of Mercian holy people at their new burhs, just as love for their extraordinary Northumbrian imperial holy person at Gloucester: 

In June 2018, ÃthelflÃ¦d's memorial service was re-established before a horde of 10,000 individuals in Gloucester, as a component of a progression of living history occasions denoting the 1,100th commemoration of her passing.
