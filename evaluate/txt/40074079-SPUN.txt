In spite of the fact that cresting at 6.52 million watchers for its debut, evaluations relentlessly dropped amid the show's kept running before rising again close to the finale.

At some random time, the four hopefuls who have gathered the most cash in their sessions live in "Champs' Row," a region of living quarters set up beside the hourglass. They are in danger of being uprooted in the event that another person outscores them. Amid a "Victor's Defense" session, the current "Influence Player" picks one of the four Winners' Row inhabitants (counting himself/herself) to go head to head against the present Money Chair tenant.

The idea of "The Million Second Quiz" was proposed to make the demonstrate a national occasion; while pitching the configuration to NBC, maker Stephen Lambert contrasted the diversion with a tennis match and called it "the Olympics of test." To advance the arrangement, NBC depended on a cross-stage limited time methodology like what it had utilized in the past for "The Voice"; including appearances by host Ryan Seacrest on other NBC programs, for example, the system's NFL pre-amusement appear, "Football Night in America". to help the show, and tie-in commercials for projects airing crosswise over other NBCUniversal properties, (for example, USA Network). The program itself likewise filled in as a vehicle for advancing NBC's then-forthcoming lineup for the 2013â 14 TV season. 

NBC needed the diversion's prime time divides publicized live from an open air area in Manhattan with the city horizon for foundation. Generation planner Anton Goss, who additionally planned the set for NBC's "The Voice", thought of a three-story bowed steel structure in the state of a mammoth hourglass bound with lights and containing the hand crafted Money Chair - "...on a housetop with the city behind us...we need to accomplish something significant...It resembles we're constructing our own little high rise." Because of the 18,000 lb weight of the hourglass structure notwithstanding cheap seats brimming with group of onlookers individuals amid show times, the structure's housetop required shoring so the second floor could help convey the vast burdens. Geiger Engineers gave the basic building to the hourglass and other housetop structures just as the required housetop shoring. Two years after the U.S. rendition of the show was communicated, a global form of the show publicized on China's Hunan TV in September 2015, entitled .

"The Million Second Quiz" got negative audits from TV commentators, and evaluations went down after some time: its debut and finale were seen by 6.52 and 4.95 million watchers separately, however fell lower in the middle. The evaluations were for the most part observed as poor; "TVWeek" depicted the show as "appraisals tested," and keeping in mind that NBC leader of option and late-night programming Paul Telegdy was happy with the introduction scene's appraisals, Michael O'Connor of "The Hollywood Reporter" portrayed it as an "appraisals calamity." O'Connor credited the poor evaluations to the show's confounding arrangement and furthermore cited a system official as saying: "I don't have the foggiest idea how much more terrible it can get." 

"The New York Times" Mike Hale trusted that the general disappointment of the arrangement was a consequence of its indistinct organization, the "hackneyed" topic of huge numbers of its inquiries (refering to precedents which went from American history to the name of Kim Kardashian's feline), the way that second screen cooperations with amusement demonstrates were not another idea, and that the show and its intuitive segments were not "focalized" enough. "Variety"s Brian Lowry contended that NBC was "excessively frantic to turn "The Million Second Quiz" into 'an occasion,'" and furthermore expressed "having watched the opening 2,600 seconds of genuine "Million Second Quiz" content, hello, wake me when it's "nearly" finished." 

Composing for "The A.V. Club", Sonia Saraiya felt that "The Million Second Quiz", rather than other significant unscripted TV dramas, for example, "Older sibling", was an "advertised show about publicity" that was "so profoundly defective thus all around disagreeable that it won't stay in anybody's memory for long. ... In this uncontrollably costly disappointment, it's conceivable to see such a significant number of NBC's defects, all in a similar bundle." However, she was satisfied the show's creation for highlighting hopefuls who were "benevolent" and "relatable," as opposed to "picked for their unpardonable character." "Computerized Spy"s Catriona Wightman questioned the arrangement would almost certainly hold viewership: "Even while I kind of appreciated the main scene regardless of myself, I can't envision getting to be fixated on it to that degree - is there actually enough there to support that sort of intrigue?" 

Composing from a non-prime time competitor's point of view, Seth Stevenson, a columnist for "Slate", by and by partook in an evening time space and was condemning of the show's treatment of challengers, uncovering, "Generation collaborators murmured that a couple of candidates who'd beat 5-Hour Energy shotsâwith an end goal to remain alertâhad been enlisting alarmingly quick resting heartbeat rates." Stevenson additionally included: "I bumbled out onto eleventh Avenue at 2:15 a.m. toward the beginning of today, two timetable days after my internment started, and...hadn't won any cash. I hadn't met Ryan Seacrest. What's more, my unhinged "Story" meeting will presently live in NBC's video vaults for interminability, in any media designs currently existing or ever to be contrived all through the known and obscure cosmic system. In any event I'm almost certain that is the thing that the discharge said. I'm still too amped up on 5-Hour Energy no doubt."
