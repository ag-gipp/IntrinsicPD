"Clear Path for Ducklings", distributed in 1941, was McCloskey's second book and was the champ of the Caldecott Medal in 1942. In his acknowledgment discourse, McCloskey clarified his inspiration for the story. While going to the Vesper George Art School in the mid 1930s, he would invest energy in the Public Garden encouraging the ducks. After some time away, he came back to Boston to paint a wall painting and made a draft of the book after motivation from May Massee. To all the more likely represent the story, McCloskey invested energy at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, visited an ornithologist, and in the end brought home for models six ducklings to live in his studio at 280 West twelfth Street, loft 4C, in New York's West Village. 

The story starts as two ducks (Mr. furthermore, Mrs. Mallard) fly over different potential areas around the city of Boston, Massachusetts (United States) to begin a family. Each time Mr. Mallard chooses an area, Mrs. Mallard discovers a major issue with it. Tired from their hunt, the mallards land at the Public Garden Lagoon to go through the night. In the first part of the day, a swan vessel goes by the mallards. The mallards botch the swan watercraft for a genuine winged animal and appreciate peanuts tossed by the general population on the vessel. Mrs. Mallard proposes that they fabricate their home in the Public Garden. In any case, similarly as she says this, her significant other is almost kept running somewhere around a passing bicyclist. The mallards proceed with their hunt, flying over Boston milestones, for example, Beacon Hill, the Massachusetts State House, and Louisburg Square. The Mallards at last settle on an island in the Charles River. From this island, the Mallards visit a policeman named Michael on the shore, who sustains them peanuts consistently. 

Presently, the Mallards shed, and won't probably fly until their new plumes develop once more, and Mrs. Mallard hatches eight ducklings named Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack. After the ducklings are conceived, Mr. Mallard chooses to travel up the waterway to perceive what its remainder resembles. Mr. what's more, Mrs. Mallard consent to meet at the Public Garden in multi week. Meanwhile, Mrs. Mallard trains the eight ducklings all they have to think about being ducks, for example, swimming, plunging, walking along, and to keep away from risks, for example, bikes and other wheeled articles. 

Multi week later, Mrs. Mallard drives the ducklings shorewards and straight to the parkway with expectations of intersection to achieve the Garden, yet she experiences difficulty crossing as the vehicles won't respect her. Michael, the policeman who the Mallards visited, stops traffic for the family to cross. Michael calls police home office and teaches them to send a squad car to stop traffic along the course for the ducks. The ducks cross the roadway, Embankment Road (Storrow Drive presently couldn't seem to be built when the book was composed), at that point continue down Mount Vernon Street to Charles Street where they head south to the Garden. The general population in the city respect the group of ducks. At the point when the family should cross Beacon Street to enter the Garden, there are four policemen remaining in the convergence ceasing traffic to clear path for the ducklings.

Delineated with sepia illustrations as opposed to the customary high contrast pictures found in most youngsters' books of the day, the book, which got the 1942 Caldecott Medal for its outlines, has kept on accumulating acclaim a very long time after its first distributing. 

The illustrations of Boston speak to a duck's eye perspective on the city. Every one of the individual ducklings is "exhausted, curious, lethargic, or they are scratching, talking over their backs to each other, racing to make up for lost time with the line". Youngsters relate to the ducklings since they carry on as kids do. The ameliorating message demonstrates guardians as overseers, defenders, and educators. 

As per individual Caldecott victor Paul O. Zelinsky, "I understood that if the activity in the illustrations were to move from left to right, the ducks couldn't have been indicated passing the Corner Book Shop, which is a great detail in the storyÂ ... He plainly knew these boulevards great."

One commentator, Alice Fannin, says the "approximately plotted" story gives no obvious clarification for why Mr. Mallard leaves the island in the Charles River or why the Mallards did not just remain on the tidal pond island in any case and keep away from the bicyclists on the shore. In any case, McCloskey has expressed himself that he considers himself a craftsman who composes kids' books and not the other way around. Fannin likewise finds the portrayal coming up short on, that is, the Mallards speak to "rather characteristically concerned guardians", frequently appearing same outward appearances and once in a while appearing. 

Another faultfinder has decidedly remarked on McCloskey's utilization of page breaks as a pacing procedure. McCloskey's utilization of one-sentence pages powers the peruser to rapidly turn the page, upgrading the feeling of movement, particularly amid the home hunt and when Mrs. Mallard shows the ducklings their fundamental abilities.
