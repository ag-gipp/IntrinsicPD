Not One Less 

Not One Less is a 1999 dramatization movie by Chinese chief Zhang Yimou, adjusted from Shi Xiangsheng's 1997 story "A Sun in the Sky" (). It was created by Guangxi Film Studio and discharged by China Film Group Corporation in terrain China, and appropriated by Sony Pictures Classics and Columbia TriStar globally. 

Set in the People's Republic of China amid the 1990s, the film focuses on a 13-year-old substitute instructor, Wei Minzhi, in the Chinese wide open. Brought in to substitute for a town educator for one month, Wei is advised not to lose any understudies. When one of the young men takes off looking for work in the huge city, she goes searching for him. The film tends to instruction change in China, the financial hole among urban and rustic populaces, and the commonness of organization and expert figures in regular day to day existence. It is recorded in a neorealist/narrative style with a troupe of non-proficient performing artists who play characters with indistinguishable names and occupations from the on-screen characters have, in actuality, obscuring the limits among dramatization and reality. 

The household arrival of "Not One Less" was joined by a Chinese government battle went for advancing the film and taking action against theft. Universally, the film was commonly generally welcomed, yet it additionally pulled in analysis for its apparently political message; remote faultfinders are partitioned on whether the film ought to be perused as commending or reprimanding the Chinese government. At the point when the film was rejected from the 1999Â Cannes Film Festival's opposition area, Zhang pulled back it and another film from the celebration, and distributed a letter censuring Cannes for politicization of and "separation" against Chinese film. The movie proceeded to win the Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion and a few different honors, and Zhang won the honor for best chief at the Golden Rooster Awards. 

During the 1990s, essential training change had turned out to be one of the top needs in the People's Republic of China. About 160Â million Chinese individuals had missed all or part of their training in view of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and mid 1970s, and in 1986 the National People's Congress ordered a law calling for a long time of necessary instruction. By 1993, plainly a great part of the nation was gaining little ground on executing nine-year necessary training, so the 1993â 2000Â seven-year plan concentrated on this objective. One of the real difficulties teachers confronted was the expansive number of rustic schoolchildren dropping out to seek after work. Another issue was a substantial urbanâ rustic gap: financing and instructor quality were far superior in urban schools than provincial, and urban understudies remained in school longer. 

"Not One Less" was Zhang Yimou's ninth film, yet just the second not to star long-lasting colleague Gong Li (the first was his 1997 "Keep Cool"). For this film, he cast just beginner on-screen characters whose genuine names and occupations looked like those of characters they played in the filmâas "The Philadelphia Inquirer"s Steven Rea portrayed the exhibitions, the performers are simply "individuals playing varieties of themselves before the camera". For example, Tian Zhenda, who played the city hall leader, was the genuine civic chairman of a little town, and the essential performing artists Wei Minzhi and Zhang Huike were chosen from among a great many understudies in country schools. (The names and occupations of the film's principle on-screen characters are recorded in the table underneath.) The motion picture was shot on area at Chicheng County's Shuiquan Primary School, and in the city of Zhangjiakou; the two areas are in Hebei region. 

The motion picture was taped in a narrative like, "neorealist" style including concealed cameras and regular lighting. There are additionally, nonetheless, components of overwhelming alteringâfor instance, Shelly Kraicer noticed that numerous scenes have visit, quick cuts, incompletely because of recording with unpracticed on-screen characters. 

Zhang needed to work intimately with government blue pencils amid creation of the film. He related how the blue pencils "continued reminding [me] not to demonstrate China as excessively in reverse and excessively poor", and said that on the title cards toward the finish of the motion picture he needed to compose that the quantity of rustic youngsters dropping out of school every year was one million, despite the fact that he trusted the number was in reality multiple times that. "Not One Less" was Zhang's first film to appreciate government backing and assets. 

Thirteen-year-old Wei Minzhi touches base in Shuiquan town to substitute for the town's solitary educator (Gao Enman) while he takes a month's leave to think about his evil mother. At the point when Gao finds that Wei does not have a secondary school training and has no unique gifts, he educates her to instruct by duplicating his writings onto the board and after that creation the understudies duplicate them into their scratch pad; he likewise advises her not to utilize more than one bit of chalk for each day, in light of the fact that the town is too poor to even think about affording more. Prior to leaving, he discloses to her that numerous understudies have as of late left school to look for some kind of employment in the urban communities, and he offers her a 10 yuan reward if every one of the understudies are still there when he returns. 

At the point when Wei starts instructing, she has little affinity with the understudies: they yell and go around as opposed to replicating their work, and the class troublemaker, Zhang Huike, demands that "she's not an educator, she's Wei Chunzhi's elder sibling!" After putting the exercise on the load up, Wei more often than not sits outside, guarding the way to ensure no understudies leave until they have completed their work. From the get-go in the month, a games selection representative comes to take one athletic young lady, Ming Xinhong, to an uncommon preparing school; reluctant to give any understudies a chance to leave, Wei conceals Ming, and when the town civic chairman (Tian Zhenda) discovers her, Wei pursues their vehicle in a useless endeavor to stop them; but then they, the games enrollment specialist and city hall leader, first notice and remark on Wei's running capacity, continuance, and tirelessness. 

At some point, subsequent to attempting to make the troublemaker Zhang apologize for pestering another understudy, Wei finds that Zhang has left to go get work in the close-by city of Zhangjiakou. The town city hall leader is reluctant to give her cash for a transport ticket to the city, so she sets out to acquire the cash herself, and enlisted people the rest of the understudies to help. One young lady proposes that they can make cash by moving blocks in an adjacent brickyard, and Wei starts giving the understudies numerical activities focused on discovering how a lot of cash they have to gain for the transport tickets, what number of blocks they have to move, and how much time it will take. Through these activities and attempting to gain cash, her affinity with the class improves. In the wake of procuring the cash, she achieves the transport station however discovers that the cost is higher than she suspected, and she can't bear the cost of a ticket. Wei winds up strolling almost the entire way to Zhangjiakou. 

In the city, Wei finds the general population that Zhang should work with, just to find that they had lost him at the train station days prior. She powers another young lady her age, Sun Zhimei, to help her search for Zhang at the train station, however they don't discover him. Wei has no achievement discovering Zhang through the open location framework and "missing individual" notices, so she goes to the nearby TV channel to communicate a missing individual notice. The assistant (Feng Yuying) won't let her in without legitimate recognizable proof, however, and says the main way she can enter is with consent from the station administrator, whom she depicts as "a man with glasses". For the remainder of the day, Wei remains by the station's solitary entryway, halting each man with glasses, however she doesn't discover the station director, and goes through the night snoozing in the city. The following day the station director (Wu Wanlu) sees her at the door once more, through his window, and gives her access, reprimanding the assistant for making her hold up outside. 

In spite of the fact that Wei has no cash to run an advertisement on TV, the station administrator is keen on her story and chooses to highlight Wei in a syndicated program uncommon about provincial training. On the syndicated program, Wei is anxious and barely says a word when the host (Li Fanfan) addresses her, however Zhangâwho has been meandering the lanes asking for sustenanceâsees the show. After Wei and Zhang are brought together, the station director orchestrates to have them driven back to Shuiquan town, alongside a truckload of school supplies and gifts that watchers had sent in. Upon their arrival, they are welcomed by the entire town. In the last scene, Wei gives the understudies a few boxes of hued chalk that were given, and enables every understudy to think of one character on the board. The film closes with a progression of title cards that relate the activities of the characters after the film closes, and portray the issue of destitution in rustic training in China. 

While the greater part of Zhang's initial movies had been recorded legends, "Not One Less" was one of the first to concentrate on contemporary China. The film's principle subject includes the troubles looked in giving provincial instruction in China. At the point when Wei Minzhi touches base in Shuiquan town, the educator Gao has not been paid in a half year and the school building is in dilapidation, and chalk is in such short supply that Gao gives Wei explicit directions constraining how substantial her composed characters ought to be. Wei rests in the school building, offering a bed to a few female understudies. The form of the film discharged abroad finishes with a progression of title cards in English, the remainder of which peruses, "Every year, neediness drives one million kids in China out school. Through the assistance of gifts, about 15% of these youngsters come back to class." 

Since the general population and areas utilized in the film are genuine however are painstakingly chosen and altered, the film makes a "contact" between narrative reality and account fiction. This exercise in careful control between the genuine and the fanciful has attracted correlations with neorealist works, for example, those of Iranian executives Abbas Kiarostami and Mohsen Makhmalbaf, and Zhang has straightforwardly recognized the impact of Kiarostami in this film. Zhang Xiaoling of the University of Nottingham contends that Zhang Yimou utilized the narrative point of view so as to recommend that the story is an exact impression of most provincial regions in China, while Shelly Kraicer trusts that his "concurrent introduction of apparently restricting messages" is a ground-breaking aesthetic strategy in of itself, and that it permits Zhang to go around blue pencils by ensuring that the motion picture will incorporate somewhere around one message that they like. Jean-Michel Frodon of "Le Monde" keeps up that the film was delivered "in the shadow of two superpowers" and expected to make bargains with each. 

The film tends to the conspicuous spot that organization, and verbal exchange and battle, possess in regular daily existence in China. Numerous scenes set Wei against power figures, for example, the town civic chairman, the host in the train station, and the TV station assistant who additionally goes about as a "watchman". Beside Wei, numerous characters in the film demonstrate a "visually impaired confidence" in power figures. While she needs cash and power, Wei conquers her impediments through sheer determination and oblivious tirelessness, recommending that discourse and diligence can beat hindrances. Wei turns into a case of "chivalrous stubbornness" and a model of utilizing assurance to confront "overpowering chances". Consequently, the film has been habitually contrasted with Zhang's 1993 "The Story of Qiu Ju", whose courageous woman is additionally a decided, difficult lady; moreover, "Qiu Ju" is likewise taped in a neo-sensible style, set in part in contemporary provincial China and in part in the city, and utilizes for the most part beginner performers. 

"Not One Less" depicts the broad communications as a locus of influence: Wei finds that just somebody with cash or associations can access a TV channel, yet once somebody is on camera she or he turns out to be a piece of an "undetectable media authority" with the ability to "control social conduct", grabbing individuals' eye where paper ads couldn't and moving cityfolk to give cash to a nation school. The intensity of TV inside the film's story, as indicated by Laikwan Pang of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, mirrors its conspicuous spot in Chinese society of the late 1990s, when household film was flopping however TV was growing rapidly; Pang contends that TV watching shapes an "aggregate awareness" for Chinese natives, and that the manner in which TV binds together individuals in "Not One Less" is a delineation of this. 

Cash is critical all through the film. Worries about cash overwhelm a significant part of the filmâfor instance, a vast bit is committed to Wei and her understudies' endeavor to procure enough cash for transport ticketsâjust as propelling them. Most significant characters, including Wei, request installment for their activities, and it is left hazy whether Wei's look for Zhang Huike is propelled by selflessness or by the guarantee of a 10-yuan reward. Zhu Ying calls attention to the unmistakable quality of cash in the film makes a contention between conventional Confucian qualities, (for example, the suggestion that the answers for Wei's issues can be found through the assistance of power figures) and current, industrialist and individualistic culture. 

At long last, the film delineates the developing urbanâ rustic partition in China. At the point when Wei comes to Zhangjiakou, the film makes an unmistakable complexity among urban and provincial life, and the two areas are physically isolated by a dim passage. The city isn't depicted as untainted; rather, Zhang demonstrates that country individuals are looked with challenges and separation in the urban areas. While Wei's first perspective on the city opens her to sharp looking individuals and current structures, the living quarters she goes to while scanning for Zhang Huike are confined and foul. In like manner, the iron door where Wei hangs tight throughout the day for the TV station chief mirrors the hindrances destitute individuals face to survival in the city, and the need of associations with abstain from turning into an "outcast" in the city. Visit cuts show Wei and Zhang meandering erratically in the boulevards, Zhang asking for nourishment, and Wei resting on the walkway; when an eager TV have later solicits Zhang what part from the city left the greatest impression, Zhang answers that the one thing he will always remember is asking for sustenance. A.O. Scott of "The New York Times" analyzed the "excruciating" give up all hope of the film's second half to that of Vittorio De Sica's 1948 "Bike Thieves". 

Not one or the other "Not One Less" nor Zhang's other 1999 film "The Road Home" was chosen for the 1999 Cannes Film Festival's Official Selection, the most renowned challenge in the celebration, where a few of Zhang's prior movies had won honors. The reason is dubious; Shelly Kraicer and Zhang Xiaoling guarantee that Cannes authorities saw the "Not One Less" upbeat closure, with the fundamental characters' contentions settled by the liberality of city tenants and higher-up authorities, as master China publicity, while Zhu Ying claims that the authorities saw it and "The Road Home" as excessively "hostile to"- government. As opposed to have his movies appeared in a less aggressive part of the celebration, Zhang pulled back them both in challenge, expressing that the motion pictures were unopinionated. In an open letter distributed in the "Beijing Youth Daily", Zhang blamed the celebration for being inspired by other than masterful concerns, and scrutinized the Western discernment that every single Chinese film must be either "genius government" or "hostile to government", alluding to it as an "oppression Chinese movies". 

Spoiled Tomatoes gave it a "new" 95% endorsement rating, in view of 43 audits and Metacritic gave it a 73, implying "for the most part great surveys". Many concentrated on the film's consummation title cards: a few contrasted them with an open administration declaration, and Philip Kemp of "Sight and Sound" expressed, "All that is missing is the location we ought to send gifts to." Zhang Xiaoling, then again, believed the titles to be an understood analysis of the condition of country training in China, saying, "the news that willful commitments have helped 15 percent of the students to come back to class is intended to offer ascent to an inquiry: shouldn't something be said about the rest of the 85 percent?" The difference about the title cards is likewise reflected in the basic response to the remainder of the film's goals. Kemp depicted the completion as "feelgood" and reprimanded the film for depicting authorities and liberal cityfolk as acting the hero, "The Washington Post"s Desson Howe called the closure "banner waving", and "The Independent"s Gilbert Adair called it "sugary". Alberto Barbera of the Venice Film Festival, then again, said that while the finish of the film may have been similar to publicity, the rest was a "solid revilement of a routine that is unfit to guarantee legitimate training for the nation kids". Moreover, Zhang Xiaoling contended that in spite of the fact that the film externally seems to adulate the city individuals and authorities, its subtext is brutally incredulous of them: he brought up that the evidently generous TV station supervisor is by all accounts spurred more by group of onlookers appraisals than by charitableness, that the secretary's hard way towards Wei is a consequence of Chinese "bureaucratism and nepotism", and that for all the beneficial things about the city, Zhang Huike's most clear memory of city life is asking for nourishment. Zhang and Kraicer both contended that commentators who see the film as star government purposeful publicity are overlooking what's really important and, as Kraicer put it, "mixing up [one] layer as the message of the filmÂ ... confusing the part with the entirety". David Ansen of "Newsweek" and Leigh Paatsch of the "Messenger Sun" each pointed out that, while the film is "deceptive[ly]" positive without needing any proof, it has brutal analysis "rising under the surface". Chinese pundits Liu Xinyi and Xu Su of "Motion picture Review" perceived the debate abroad about whether the film was master or hostile to government, however made no remark; they applauded the film for its practical depiction of hardships confronting provincial individuals, without guessing about whether Zhang planned to censure or acclaim the administration's treatment of those hardships. Hao Jian of "Film Appreciation", then again, was increasingly basic, guaranteeing that the motion picture was composed around a political message and was expected to be ace government. Hao said that "Not One Less" denoted the start of Zhang's change from a frank autonomous chief to one of the administration's top picks. 

Generally, commentators were inspired with the exhibitions of the beginner performers, and Jean-Michel Frodon of "Le Monde" called that the film's most noteworthy achievement. Dwindle Rainer of "New York Magazine" adulated the scene of Wei's meeting on TV as "a standout amongst the most unrealistically fulfilling adoration scenes on film". The film additionally gotten applause for its imaginative benefits and Hou Yong's cinematography, despite the fact that its visuals were oversimplified contrasted with Zhang's past movies; for instance, A.O. Scott of "The New York Times" adulated the "extravagance" shown by the film in spite of its purposeful shortage of shading. Commentators additionally called attention to that Zhang had prevailing with regards to splitting far from the "business stimulation wave" of mainstream film. Noel Vera of "BusinessWorld" composes that the film concerns itself principally with passionate effect, to the detriment of visual lavishness, making it the inverse of prior Zhang Yimou movies, for example, "Red Sorghum". Different faultfinders noticed the quality of the film's narrating; for example, Rainer considered the film an "extraordinary, and exceptionally moving, romantic tale", and "Film Journal International"s Kevin Lally portrayed it as "an impactful story of destitution and soul reminiscent of the incomparable Italian neo-pragmatists." Another generally welcomed piece of the film was the section in which Wei instructs math by making handy models out of her endeavor to fund-raise for the transport to Zhangjiakou; in the Chinese diary "Educator Doctrines", Mao Wen composed that instructors ought to gain from Wei's precedent and furnish understudies with functional activities. 

Wei Minzhi's character got blended responses: Scott depicted her as a "brave" character who shows how resolution can be an uprightness, though Richard Corliss of "Time" says she is "no more brilliant or more creative than [her students]". Responses to the city segment of the motion picture were additionally blended: while Zhang depicts the second 50% of the film as an articulate critique on China's urban-provincial partition and Kevin Lally calls it "alarming", Kemp condemns it for being an anticipated "Victorian platitude". 

Rights to appropriate the film were acquired by the China Film Group Corporation, a state-supported association, and the administration effectively advanced the film. It was formally discharged in terrain China in , in spite of the fact that there were showings as right on time as mid-February. Sheldon H. Lu reports that the film netted Â¥18Â million, a normal sum, in its initial three months of appearing; before the finish of its keep running in November, it sold Â¥40Â million in the cinema world. (In examination, Zhang's 2002 film "Saint" would win Â¥270Â million three years after the fact.) Nevertheless, "Not One Less" was the most astounding earning local film of 1999, and Laikwan Pang has considered it a "film industry achievement". In the United States, the film was discharged in theaters on 2000, and earned $50,256 in its first end of the week and $592,586 generally; The discharge was dealt with by Sony Pictures Classics, and home video circulation by Columbia TriStar; "Not One Less" was Columbia's first Chinese film. 

Lu cautions that household film industry deals are not dependable markers of a film's prevalence in territory China, as a result of robbery and in light of state or social gathering sponsorship; numerous laborers were sans given tickets to advance the film, and a 1999 report guaranteed that a bigger number of tickets were acquired by the administration than by people. The film was more well known than most government-advanced movies touting the partisan loyalty and Lu guarantees that it had "huge social help", yet Pang brings up that its prosperity was "not absolutely populist, however incompletely built." 

At the season of "Not One Less" discharge, DVD and VCD theft was a developing worry in terrain China, and the China Copyright Office issued a notice denying unapproved generation or conveyance of the film. This was the first run through China had authorized exceptional copyright securities for a local film. On 1999, Hubei region's Culture Office issued a "Pressing Notice for Immediate Confiscation of Pirated "Not One Less" VCDs", and after two days the Culture Office and motion picture organization united to direct assaults on ten sound video stores, seizing pilfered circles from six of them. 

In spite of the fact that it was pulled back from Cannes, "Not One Less" proceeded to win the Golden Lion, the top honor at the Venice Film Festival. Zhang additionally got a best chief honor at the Golden Rooster, territory China's most renowned honor function, and the film was casted a ballot one of the best three of the year in the Hundred Flowers Awards. Grants the film won or was designated for are recorded underneath.
