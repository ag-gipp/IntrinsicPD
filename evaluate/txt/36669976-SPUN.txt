He attributes this to the irregular symbolism utilized, including "if it's not exactly standard it sneaks through, yet it may be the case that the 'not exactly standard' things make it considerably additionally frightening and exasperating". 

The cast of "Twin Peaks" did not realize who might be uncovered as Palmer's executioner for quite a while.

Astute was assembled to a conference with Lynch, Frost, Sheryl Lee and Richard Beymer, amid which Lynch told those collected that Leland Palmer was the executioner: while tending to Wise, Lynch said "Beam, it was you, it was dependably you".

In any case, Lavery alluded to the duality of Leland and Bob as an "abstract development" and included that the utilization of bounce cuts "could be Maddy's perspective on Leland the same amount of as Leland's perspective on himself". 

This scene has likewise been noted by faultfinder Sue Lafky from the "Diary of Film and Video" as one of a few in the arrangement that recommend inbreeding and necrophilia. She theorized that "Leland/Bob may have assaulted the dead or passing on Maddie", contrasting this with the "necrophilic dreams" that Laura Palmer's carcass summons, and Ben Horne's accidental brush with inbreeding when he experiences his little girl Audrey at a massage parlor. Prior in the scene it is uncovered that Laura had been liable to sexual maltreatment by BOB, and certainly Leland, which was additionally investigated in the 1992 prequel film, "".
