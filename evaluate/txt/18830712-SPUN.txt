"Batman: Arkham Asylum" was first reported in August 2008; it was created by British studio Rocksteady Studios under the aegis of Eidos Interactive and Warner Bros. Intelligent Entertainment. Eidos got the rights to make a Batman amusement in spring 2007, and moved toward then little-known Rocksteady in the wake of review the designer's model. At Eidos' solicitation, Rocksteady exhibited their way to deal with the "Batman" permit, and by May 2007, they had started building up the diversion's idea, with full creation starting in September. Essayist Paul Dini ("", "Criminologist Comics") was first drawn nearer by DC Comics around late 2007 about the possibility of making a story for a unique Batman computer game. Dini considered the thought fascinating, trusting that couple of Batman recreations depended on a unique thought, rather being adjusted from film or TV. DC Comics asked Dini what his way to deal with composing another Batman film or realistic novel would be, however one that was intended for ongoing interaction. He later met with the Rocksteady group, where it was concluded that Dini's thoughts were in accordance with what Rocksteady needed to accomplish. When Dini joined the undertaking, Rocksteady were exploring setting the amusement inside Arkham, and had delivered primer structures delineating it as a colossal home on an island associated with territory Gotham City by an extension. The cast had not been settled, however given the setting it was sure that the Joker would assume an expansive job. The diversion and story were grown together, with the impediments of mechanics requiring the story to be worked around them. The center point was to make the diversion connecting enough for players to go through 8â 10 hours finishing it, particularly those uninterested in Batman-diversified media. Rocksteady would control Dini when they thought he was composing an excessive amount of story or character inspiration. 

Among different Neal Adams and Frank Miller-wrote "Batman" stories, Grant Morrison's "" was a motivation for the diversion's plan. Maker Nathan Burlow said the account and environment of the 2007 diversion "BioShock" impacted "Arkham Asylum"s structure. Executive Sefton Hill said the impacts of the devices and capacities that can be consolidated and utilized in various ways from "The Legend of Zelda" and "Metroid". The plan group disengaged the segments that they felt made Batman, and misrepresented these components. Structure thoughts which repudiated these features of the character were dropped, and different components of Batman, for example, his refusal to execute his adversaries, were carefully upheld, which gave extra difficulties in enabling the player to have total opportunity in the diversion without transgressing on that basic part of the character. Arkham Asylum was picked as the setting since it bound the player to a zone containing a few adversaries, while in an open city setting he could get help, come back to the Batcave, or generally have the capacity to remove himself from his rivals. 

The advancement group needed to incorporate notable parts of the Batman mythos, and chose right off the bat underway to have Conroy, Hamill, and Sorkin repeat their jobs in Dini's "Batman: The Animated Series" as Batman, the Joker, and Harley Quinn, individually. Hamill has a large number of lines of discourse in the diversion, and Conroy has moderately few in examination. In the wake of seeing character models of the Joker's "Arkham Asylum" appearance, Hamill chose to depict the character as dim and coarse while holding a clownish and lively nature. In spite of the fact that the diversion highlights references to plot occasions in both "The Animated Series" and "Batman" funnies, the story does not straightforwardly pursue any particular story or delineation of the character. 

The diversion took roughly 21 months to finish; Rocksteady started advancement with a group of 40, which had extended to around 60 by the amusement's culmination. Battle was viewed as one of the best difficulties in building up the amusement; the framework experienced three emphasess. Rocksteady initially built up the amusement's battle as a full musicality activity diversion. It was later set in 2D, which included shaded circles colliding with one another amid battles; the last framework depended on this 2D display. Battle was intended to be one of a kind for Batman, and was given a straightforward control plan to mirror the straightforwardness with which Batman can play out the moves. "Arkham Asylum" was based on Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3. Eidos president Ian Livingstone said one designer went through two years writing computer programs Batman's cape, utilizing more than 700 livelinesss and audio effects to make it move reasonably. 

The engineers proposed to utilize other Batman characters in the amusement, yet these were evacuated when it was chosen they would not work inside the story. For instance, Batman's foe Mr. Stop did not fit in light of the fact that the character has distinctive inspirations to the Joker. In contrast to the Riddler, who is fixated on demonstrating his prevalence over Batman, Mr. Stop does not hold an individual resentment against Batman, and Mr. Stop would not think about the other lowlifess' arrangements. A patio nursery labyrinth under Poison Ivy's control was considered as an area; she could develop it in various ways. In its middle, Batman would locate the Mad Hatter facilitating a tea-get-together, yet the engineers chose these thoughts would not coordinate the amusement's tone. Batman's vehicles, the Batmobile and Batwing, were considered for consideration in the amusement, however creating one of a kind control mechanics and ongoing interaction portions for them would have taken an excessive amount of time, and traded off its quality; the vehicles show up in the diversion, yet players can't control them. 

Rocksteady started considering thoughts for a conceivable spin-off, which moved toward becoming "", roughly seven months before advancement of "Arkham Asylum" was finished. Rocksteady created thoughts for the spin-off's story and setting so the amusements' stories could be adequately associated. A mystery room containing indications, outlines, and idea craftsmanship for the following amusement was covered up in the refuge superintendent's office in "Arkham Asylum". The room stayed covered up for a half year following the diversion's discharge until Rocksteady uncovered its quality. "Arkham Asylum"s melodic score was created by Ron Fish and Nick Arundel, who likewise formed the soundtrack for the continuation, "Batman: Arkham City". 

To build up the amusement's general tasteful, the primary point was to make structures that would join comic book style with authenticity. The ecological engineering and characters must be extreme enough to speak to the "Batman" universe, however required practical surface and detail. The second point was to reproduce the dull, Gothic symbolism innate to the "Batman" universe, particularly Arkham Asylum, with the goal that the structure would feel as crazy as those whom it houses. The shelter was viewed as a perfect area since it can house a significant number of Batman's enemies. 

Batman's plan was intensely affected by crafted by comic craftsman Jim Lee, who drew Batman as a solid, strong character who could credibly partake in outrageous battle. His dark and dim outfit depended on present day forms, and has military impacts and a modern look. Around thirteen idea plans were created before his last appearance took structure. Craftsmen stayed away from film understandings of the Joker, incompletely in light of the fact that the designers just approached the rights to the first Batman permit. Alan Moore's 1988 realistic novel "" impacted the character's plan. Harley Quinn experienced a radical overhaul, expelling her dark and red full-body outfit and jokester's cap, and supplanting them with an ensemble with plan components from a medical caretaker's outfit and a student's uniform. WildStorm, Lee's comic book distributing organization, created idea workmanship for the diversion. 

Structures for the refuge left from comic translations of a huge house and rather built up a whole island, with indications of Alcatraz jail, made out of various structures to take into consideration more prominent assortment and investigation. Each structure was planned with an alternate design style to influence the office to seem convincing and to saturate every area with a history. The therapeutic structure was enlivened by Victorian engineering and its metalwork structure was expected to move sentiments of awfulness. The concentrated treatment unit has a Gothic, mechanical stylish. The sepulchers underneath the office, propelled by mid twentieth-century brickwork and Victorian industry, were intended to feel abusive. The greatest security zone was intended to feel claustrophobic and was retrofitted like a fortification, and the Arkham manor shows a High Gothic style. The fashioners incorporated slanted lines into ecological items, for example, trees and drainpipes, where conceivable. 40 rooms, 34 passages, three outside zones, and three Scarecrow-instigated mind flight zones were intended for the diversion. 

To breath life into these territories, the dimension architects delivered diversion technician components utilizing basic room designs and shapes, while idea specialists worked couple to make craftsmanship for every area, following the workmanship course. Condition specialists would then form 3D formats dependent on those structures. Finding a suitable shading palette for the diversion world was troublesome; tans and monochromatic hues could delineate the ideal dull and ill humored environment, yet the designers needed the stylish to look like the energetic shading plans of a comic book. To this end, they utilized soaked hues for in-amusement lighting. Lighting was an imperative segment of the amusement, being utilized to feature focal points and to draw the player forward in generally exhausting hallways. To keep up the planned dimension of detail and enable the amusement's support adaptations to fit into the gadgets' memory, every territory must be gushed all through memory consistently to free up memory for surfaces and geometry. The majority of the cutscenes were storyboarded by Rocksteady craftsmen, being pictured in the amusement motor before the character exhibitions were movement caught. The plan group chose that cutscenes ought to be utilized to propel character connections, and that after each cutscene the player ought to have had their objective changed or the significance of their activities adjusted. Need was given to keeping activity scenes under the player's control, as opposed to appearing in cutscenes.
