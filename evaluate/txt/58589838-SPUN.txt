Instead of resume his financial profession after the war, Spence joined the Department of Information in Canberra, at first in organization and later in aeronautics news coverage.

Elevated to wing administrator, Spence was presented on Japan to assume responsibility for No.Â 77 Squadron on 28Â February 1950. Based at Iwakuni, the squadron worked P-51 Mustangs as a feature of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). Initially one of three RAAF contender units under BCOF, No. 77 Squadron had since late-1948 been Australia's sole air segment in Japan, turning into the biggest flying squadron in the Air Force, with around 300 officers and men, forty Mustangs, and a few transport air ship. Occupation obligations had been uneventful, the primary operational errand being observation watches, yet the RAAF kept up a concentrated preparing routine and attempted consolidated activities with other Allied powers. On 23Â June, No. 77 Squadron made what was required to be its last trip before pivoting back to Australia. 

Spence and his family were going to go on vacation before coming back to Australia when, on 25Â June 1950, No. 77 Squadron was put on backup for activity in the Korean War, which had quite recently broken out. The unit was explicitly mentioned by General Douglas MacArthur, officer of United Nations (UN) powers. No. 77 Squadron flew its underlying escort and watch fights from Iwakuni on 2Â July, turning into the first non-American UN unit to go energetically. That day, Spence took eight Mustangs on an escort mission for United States Air Force (USAF) B-26 Invaders assaulting an extension south of Seoul.

A well disposed flame episode happened on 3Â July 1950, when No.Â 77 Squadron assaulted a train brimming with US and South Korean troops on the primary interstate among Suwon and Pyongtaek, causing numerous setbacks, twenty-nine of them lethal. Preceding the mission, Spence had raised worries that the North Koreans couldn't have infiltrated so far south, however was guaranteed by USAF controllers that the objective was right. The episode was broadly detailed in American papers yet an open articulation by Lieutenant General George E. Stratemeyer, authority of the US Far East Air Force, cleared the RAAF of fault. Spence was suggested for the US Air Medal for "praiseworthy administration" in activities from 25Â June to 15Â July. His undeniably substantial taskload included conciliatory obligations and advertising, just as squadron organization and many battle forays. 

No.Â 77 Squadron did not experience foe flying machine in the opening period of the war, however regularly confronted exceptional ground fire. Amid July and August 1950, furnished with bombs, rockets and napalm, the Mustangs bolstered UN troops withdrawing before the North Korean development. As indicated by the official history of the Air Force in 1946â 1971, the squadron's part in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter earned acknowledgment "for the RAAF as well as Australia at the most astounding political dimensions in the United States". On 15 August, Prime Minister Robert Menzies displayed the Gloucester Cup to No.Â 77 Squadron as the RAAF's most capable unit of the previous year. General Stratemeyer touched base at Iwakuni seven days after the fact to astonish Spence with the honor of the US Legion of Merit for "exceptional authority in the readiness of his unit for battle". 

On 9 September, in shady conditions, Spence drove three different Mustangs in a low-level napalm assault on An'gang-ni. He endeavored to haul out of a precarious plunge yet slammed amidst the town and was executed. Regardless of whether he was hit by ground fire or had misconceived his assault is questionable. Spence's significant other and youngsters were all the while living at Iwakuni, and his passing rushed the flight for Australia of all families on the base. He was prevailing by Squadron Leader Dick Cresswell, who had twice instructed No. 77 Squadron amid World War II. Cresswell remarked that "on account of Lou Spence", the squadron "was driven splendidly in every one of the employments it did". 

As indicated by his sibling, cited in the Brisbane "Dispatch Mail", Spence wrote in his last letter home: 

Flight Lieutenant (later Air Vice-Marshal) Fred Barnes depicted Spence's passing as having "a colossal impactÂ ... He was well known and regarded as an expert. It was acknowledged that he was en route to high position." The official history of the post-war Air Force battled that Spence "seemed bound for the most abnormal amounts of the RAAF". Stratemeyer appraised him "a standout amongst the most fit field administrators I have been related with", and "one of the noblest and best officers of any administration". 

Spence was prescribed for the Distinguished Service Order for his "remarkable valiant initiative and qualification" in Korea, yet the honor was changed to a bar to his DFC. The design was declared in "The London Gazette" on 17 April 1951 and exhibited to his better half on 22 February 1952. His honors of the US Legion of Merit and Air Medal were gazetted on 22 June 1951; the last was exhibited secretly to Vernon Spence. 

Propelling UN troops found Spence's body close to his slammed Mustang in October 1950. He is covered at the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Busan, South Korea. His name shows up on Panel 2 of the Commemorative Area of the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.
