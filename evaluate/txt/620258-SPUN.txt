A Handful of Dust 

A Handful of Dust is a novel by the British essayist Evelyn Waugh. First distributed in 1934, usually assembled with the creator's initial, mocking comic books for which he ended up renowned in the pre-World War II years. Analysts have, be that as it may, attracted thoughtfulness regarding its genuine undercurrents, and have viewed it as a transitional work pointing towards Waugh's Catholic after war fiction. 

The hero is Tony Last, a placated however shallow English nation squire, who, having been deceived by his better half and seen his deceptions broke one by one, joins an endeavor to the Brazilian wilderness, just to end up caught in a remote station as the detainee of a lunatic. Waugh fused a few self-portraying components into the plot, including his very own ongoing departure by his significant other. In 1933â 34 he went into the South American inside, and various episodes from the voyage are joined into the novel. Tony's particular destiny in the wilderness was first utilized by Waugh as the subject of a free short story, distributed in 1933 under the title "The Man Who Liked Dickens". 

The book's underlying basic gathering was unobtrusive, however it was mainstream with the general population and has never been no longer in production. In the years since distribution the book's notoriety has developed; it is by and large thought to be a standout amongst Waugh's best works, and has more than once figured on informal arrangements of the twentieth century's best books. 

Waugh had changed over to Roman Catholicism in 1930, after which his sarcastic, mainstream compositions drew threatening vibe from some Catholic quarters. He didn't bring unmistakably religious subjects into "A Handful of Dust", yet later clarified that he expected the book to show the worthlessness of humanist, as particular from religious, particularly Catholic, values. The book has been sensationalized for radio, stage and screen. 

Tony Last is a nation honorable man, living with his significant other Brenda and his eight-year-old child John Andrew in his tribal home, Hetton Abbey. The house is a Victorian pseudo-Gothic pastiche portrayed as structurally "without enthusiasm" by a neighborhood manual and "appalling" by his better half, however is Tony's pride and euphoria. Altogether content with nation life, he is apparently unconscious of Brenda's expanding fatigue and disappointment, and of his child's creating waywardness. Brenda meets John Beaver and, in spite of recognizing his bluntness and irrelevance, she starts an issue with him. Brenda begins going through her weeks in London, and convinces Tony to fund a little level, which she leases from John's mom, Mrs Beaver, a deceitful property engineer. In spite of the fact that the Brendaâ Beaver contact is outstanding to their London companions, Tony stays uxorious and careless; endeavors by Brenda and her companions to set him up with a special lady are preposterously ineffective. 

Brenda is in London when John Andrew is executed in a riding mishap. On being informed that "John is dead", Brenda at first conceives that Beaver has passed on; on discovering that it is her child John, she sells out her actual emotions by expressing an automatic "Say thanks to God!". After the burial service, she discloses to Tony that she needs a separation so she can wed Beaver. On learning the degree of her trickery Tony is broken, yet consents to ensure Brenda's social notoriety by enabling her to separate from him, and to give her Â£500 per year. In the wake of spending a clumsy however virtuous end of the week in Brighton with a whore thinking up separation proof, Tony gains from Brenda's sibling that, energized by Beaver, Brenda is presently requesting Â£2,000 every yearâa total that would require Tony to sell Hetton. Tony's hallucinations are broken. Be that as it may, the whore carried her youngster with her who can set up that Tony did not submit infidelity and the shakedown comes up short. Tony pulls back from the separation exchanges, and declares that he expects to go for a half year. On his arrival, he says, Brenda may have her separation, however with no money related repayment. 

With no prospect of Tony's cash, Beaver loses enthusiasm for Brenda, who is left uncontrolled and in destitution. In the mean time, Tony has met a voyager, Dr. Messinger, and goes along with him on a campaign looking for an alleged lost city in the Amazon rainforest. On the outward voyage, Tony participates in a shipboard sentiment with ThÃ©rÃ¨se de VitrÃ©, a young lady whose Roman Catholicism makes her avoid him when he discloses to her he has a spouse. In Brazil, Messinger demonstrates an uncouth coordinator; he can't control the local aides, who surrender him and Tony in the profundities of the wilderness. Tony becomes sick, and Messinger leaves in their solitary kayak to discover help, however is cleared over a cascade and slaughtered. 

Tony meanders in insanity until he is saved by Mr. Todd, an ostracize Englishman who governs over a little local clan in a remote clearing in the wilderness. Todd medical caretakers Tony back to wellbeing. Albeit ignorant, Todd possesses duplicates of the total works of Charles Dickens, and asks Tony to peruse to him. Be that as it may, when Tony's wellbeing recuperates and he requests to be helped on his way, the elderly person over and over challenges. The readings proceed, yet the climate turns out to be progressively threatening as Tony acknowledges he is being held without wanting to. At the point when an inquiry party at last achieves the settlement, Todd organizes that Tony be sedated and kept shrouded; he tells the gathering that Tony has kicked the bucket, and gives them his watch to bring home. At the point when Tony gets up he discovers that his expectations of salvage are gone, and that he is sentenced to peruse Dickens to his captor inconclusively. Back in England, Tony's demise is acknowledged; Hetton goes to his cousins, who erect a commemoration to his memory, while Brenda weds Tony's companion Jock Grant-Menzies. 

Evelyn Waugh, conceived in 1903, was the more youthful child of Arthur Waugh, the overseeing chief of the London distributing firm of Chapman and Hall. In the wake of going to Lancing College and Hertford College, Oxford, Waugh instructed for a long time in a progression of private academies before starting his vocation as an author. His first monetarily printed work was a short story, "The Balance", which Chapman and Hall incorporated into a 1926 treasury. He worked quickly as an "Every day Express" columnist, and composed a short history of the pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti before making progress in 1928 with the distribution of his comic novel, "Decrease and Fall". Before the finish of 1932 Waugh had composed two further books, "Abominable Bodies" and "Dark Mischief", and two travel books. His expert triumphs matched with private changes; in June 1928 he wedded Evelyn Gardner, however a little more than a year later the marriage finished when she proclaimed her adoration for the couple's common companion John Heygate. Compromise demonstrated incomprehensible, and Waugh sought legal separation in September 1929. In the meantime, Waugh was experiencing guidance which prompted his gathering, in September 1930, into the Roman Catholic Church. 

Waugh's adherence to Catholic instructing on separation caused him disappointment while anticipating the conceivable abrogation of his marriage. He had begun to look all starry eyed at Teresa Jungman, a vivacious socialite whose Catholicism blocked any closeness in their relationship since according to the Church Waugh stayed wedded. Waugh's transformation did not extraordinarily influence the astringent and forcefully humorous tone of his fictionâhis central characters were habitually irreverent and their exercises now and again stunning. Waugh asserted "the privilege to compose of man's debasement in such a style as to make it ugly". At the point when "Dark Mischief" was distributed in 1932, the editorial manager of the Catholic diary "The Tablet", Ernest Oldmeadow, propelled a vicious assault on the book and its writer, expressing that the novel was "a disfavor to anyone purporting the Catholic name". Waugh, composed Oldmeadow, "was resolved to explaining a work over the top not exclusively to Catholic however to conventional models of humility". Waugh made no open counter of these charges; an open letter to the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster was readied, however on the guidance of Waugh's companions was not sent. 

In 1932 Waugh left on an all-encompassing voyage to South America. His choice to missing himself may have been a response to his inexorably entangled passionate life; while his enthusiasm for Teresa Jungman stayed pathetic, he was associated with different unacceptable easygoing sexual contacts, and was himself being sought after by the a lot more established Hazel Lavery. The decision of South America was likely affected by Peter Fleming, the artistic manager of "The Spectator". Fleming had as of late come back from a campaign to Brazil looking for hints of Colonel Percy Fawcett who, in 1925, had vanished in Brazil while hunting down a famous lost city. 

Having seen "Dark Mischief" propelled to blended yet commonly great basic remark (Oldmeadow's mediation was not prompt), Waugh cruised from Tilbury on 2 December 1932. He touched base in British Guiana on 23 December, and after some long periods of uncertainty selected to go with the area magistrate for Rupununi, on an adventure into the inside. He trusted that he may reach Manaus, a huge city profound inside the Brazilian wilderness, yet transport demonstrated untrustworthy, and he got no more remote than the bordertown of Boa Vista. In transit, at one of his medium-term ceasing focuses, he experienced Mr Christie, an older blended race pioneer who welcomed him by saying, "I was anticipating you. I was cautioned in a dream of your methodology". The two appreciated a pleasing supper together, where Christie talked of the "Fifth Kingdom" (a scriptural prediction from the Book of Daniel). He revealed to Waugh that he had seen the whole assembling of the holy people in paradiseâshockingly couple of, he saidâyet couldn't check them since they were spiritual. Waugh added Christie to his "treasury of whimsies", put aside for future abstract use. 

Waugh landed at Boa Vista on 4 February 1933, to discover no vessels accessible to take him on to Manaus. Long stretches of latency and fatigue pursued, with "nothing to peruse aside from certain existences of the Saints in French and Bossuet's lessons". Waugh relaxed by composing a short story; despite the fact that not recognized in the journals, this story has been commonly acknowledged as "The Man Who Liked Dickens". Aside from utilizing distinctive names and some minor subtleties this story is equivalent to the scene that Waugh later utilized as the peak to "A Handful of Dust": an old pilgrim (demonstrated in way, discourse and appearance on Christie), protects and holds hostage a lost pioneer and expects him to peruse out loud the books of Dickens, in interminability. The story was distributed in 1933, in America in "Hearst's Internationalâ Cosmopolitan", and in Britain in "Nash's Pall Mall Magazine". In an article composed numerous years after the fact, Waugh clarified how the story turned into the reason for his next novel: "The thought [for the short story] came normally from the experience of visiting a forlorn pilgrim [Christie]Â ... also, reflecting how effectively he could hold me detainee. At that point, after the short story was composed and distributed, the thought continued working in my brain. I needed to find how the detainee arrived, and in the long run the thing developed into an investigation of different sorts of savage at home and the socialized man's powerless situation among them." 

On his arrival to England in May 1933, Waugh, shy of money, needed to finish various composition duties before he could start deal with the anticipated novel. In Octoberâ November he composed his record of the South American adventure, which he called "Ninety-two Days". He at that point went to Fez in Morocco, to start the novel in warmth and isolation. In January he kept in touch with Mary Lygon, detailing that he had composed 18,500 expressions of "my dirty novel", and later he told Katharine Asquith: "I have recently executed a young man at a yard meet and influenced his mom to submit adulteryÂ ... so maybe you won't care for it all things considered". By 10 February he had achieved the midpointâ45,000 wordsâyet was questionable how the story ought to continue, and came back to England toward the finish of February with the vast majority of the second half unwritten. He completed the book at the Easton Court Hotel at Chagford, in Devon, an ordinary retreat that he utilized while finishing composing ventures. By mid-April the book was with his distributers, Chapman and Hall, and Waugh was caught up with revising the confirmations. 

Waugh's specialist A. D. Diminishes sold the pre-distribution serialization rights to the American month to month magazine "Harper's Bazaar". Since the "Mr Todd" scene had been distributed as a short story the earlier year, for the reasons for the serialization Waugh gave an elective completion. In this, the entire Brazilian experience was supplanted by a concise coda, in which Tony comes back from an extravagance journey to be welcomed by a berated Brenda requesting to be accommodated. Tony concurs, at the same time, obscure to her, he chooses to keep her London level for his very own motivations. Waugh's biographer Selena Hastings portrays this completion as "imaginatively undeniably increasingly reciprocal" than that utilized in the book form; a prior biographer, Christopher Sykes suspected that had this option been held in the book form, the novel would not have obtained its later qualification. 

In March 1933 Waugh kept in touch with Peters from Chagford to state that he expected to call the novel "A Handful of Ashes". This title was detested by "Harpers"; an option, "Fourth Decade", was likewise considered and dismissed. At long last, the story was serialized under the title "A Flat in London", and the picked book title was "A Handful of Dust"â taken from a line in T. S. Eliot's lyric "The Waste Land": "I will indicate you dread in a bunch of residue." The line is inside the segment of the lyric entitled "The Burial of the Dead", which delineates a dismal, dormant place that is known for desert and rubble, mirroring the vacant good mood of the novel. The title expression had been utilized before by Joseph Conrad in the story "Youth"; by Tennyson in "Maud"; and significantly prior by John Donne in his "Contemplations". 

In his investigation of Waugh's scholarly life, David Wykes portrays "A Handful of Dust" as "a fearless and skilful demonstration of anecdotal collection of memoirs", driven by the injury of the author's separation without which, Wykes keeps up, the book would not have been composed. Waugh, says his biographer Martin Stannard, was "digging the memory of his own anguish" in archiving the breakdown of the Lasts' marriage. The faultfinder Cyril Connolly, whose first response to the work had been negative, later called it "the main book which comprehends the genuine frightfulness of the withdrawal of fondness in an undertaking from [the perspective of] the honest party". 

Wykes trusts that, of the novel's three focal characters, just Tony is illustrative of his genuine equalâWaugh in his pre-Catholic skeptical state. Brenda is depicted in the novel as run of the mill of a large number of the ladies in Waugh's initial storiesâvery much reared, trifling and irresoluteâhowever Wykes contends that she isn't a portrayal of Evelyn Gardner, "neither in internal nor outward characteristics". Nor, he declares, is Beaver proposed as an exact depiction of Evelyn Gardner's sweetheart, the "terrifying nullity" of Beaver being a type of artistic vengeance on the educated Heygate. There is general understanding among analysts that different characters are drawn from life: Mr Todd is unmistakably founded on the offbeat but instead less vile Mr Christie; Dr Messinger, the clumsy wayfarer, reflects W. E. Roth, the caretaker of the Georgetown gallery whom Waugh thought about going with into the wilderness, just to be prevented by reports of Roth's flippancy and dismissal of peril. ThÃ©rÃ¨se de VitrÃ©, the object of Tony's hopeless endeavor at a shipboard sentiment, was named "Bernadette" in the first original copy; the change was made as a kind of perspective to Waugh's non-romantic companion Teresa Jungman. ThÃ©rÃ¨se reports her predetermination to wed a rich Catholic, and, in a reverberation of Jungman, draws back from Tony when she finds that despite everything he has a spouse. The summit of Tony's incidents, his oppression to Mr Todd and Dickens, is foreshadowed in Waugh's life by his dad's propensity for perusing his most loved writing out loud to his family, three or four nights per week: "...Â most of Shakespeare, a large portion of Dickens, a large portion of TennysonÂ ... venturing about the room and depicting the charactersÂ ... he held us enchanted". 

The craftsmanship student of history John Richardson, be that as it may, composed, in the article "Sybil Colefax, Lion Hunter" (House and Garden, September 1983), that the general public decorator Lady Colefax "was the model for the dangerous decorator, Mrs. Beaver (as, supposedly, her child Michael was the model for Mrs. Beaver's child John)." 

Pundits and observers have commonly recognized that "A Handful of Dust" stands separated from Waugh's other prewar fiction. Philip Toynbee depicts it as a defining moment in Waugh's adventure from by and large parody to disappointed authenticity: "Quite a bit of this book is in the old way, entertaining ridiculous bound with interesting harsh, however the entire tone and environment are brutally changed when the young man is murdered". In like manner Gerald Gould in "The Observer", looking into the book's underlying distribution in 1934: "Here was the old ravishing, imprudent note of hatred and bafflement. Continuously, relentlessly, the note changes and extends". A later faultfinder, John Cunningham, perceives that elaborately, the book is in an alternate class from Waugh's different 1930s books, both increasingly aspiring and progressively uncertain. In spite of the fact that, says Cunningham, "[i]t incites as much realizing giggling as Waugh's different parodies of habits", it is a noteworthy advance far from its ancestors, towards the Catholic "comedies of recovery" that would turn into the key focal point of his career as a writer. 

In first experience with the 1997 Penguin version, Robert Murray Davis proposes that to some extent, the book mirrored Waugh's reexamination of his situation as a Catholic essayist, in the light of the ongoing Oldmeadow furore over "Dark Mischief". He may have built up an increasingly genuine tone to pre-empt further analysis from that quarter, in spite of the fact that Stannard keeps up that Waugh's beginnings as a genuine essayist go back to 1929, when he was finishing "Wretched Bodies". Waugh's very own remark, in 1946, was that he was not, as indicated by his very own comprehension of the term, a "mocking" essayist, and that recorded as a hard copy the book he was just "attempting to distil satire and some of the time disaster from the knockabout joke of individuals' outward conduct". 

William Plomer, writing in "The Spectator" after the book's first production, thought it mixed up "to respect Mr Waugh's all the more amazing circumstances as ridiculous or implausible; they are overall incredibly practical". In any case, the blend of kinds was not promptly comprehended or increased in value by a portion of Waugh's admirers; Connolly's underlying idea was that Waugh had been "obliterated as an essayist", by grandiosity and relationship with nation house living. In Sykes' view, the short lived appearances in the book of characters from Waugh's absurd world, for example, Lady Metroland, are cumbersome and nosyâthe universe of "A Handful of Dust" isn't extraordinary: "Evelyn would have improved to have overlooked Lady Metroland and her reality through and through". 

Cunningham sees "A Handful of Dust" as a herald of Waugh's later, avowedly Catholic books. With regards to Waugh's cavalier mentality to the Church of England, Anglicanism is appeared as a sham (Mr Tendril the vicar's lessons), or a nullity (Tony's affirmation that he had never truly considered God). Rather, Christianity is evoked by displaying the terribleness of existence without it; as indicated by the essayist and faultfinder Frank Kermode, "[T]he insensitivity of occurrence and the briskness of tone work by recommending the positive and judicious assertion of the Faith". The peruser, Stannard says, "is never permitted to overlook man's basic bestialityÂ ... God is the key that has been discarded in this absolutely common world". John Raymond in the "New Statesman" alludes to Waugh's "extraordinary kind of good vision", and considers the novel an "amazing twentieth century message on the breakdown of a Christian marriage". 

Tony's bound mission in the Brazilian wilderness is confined in scriptural terms; the important part title, "In Search of a City" insinuates Hebrews 13:14: "For here we have no proceeding with city, however we look for one to come". Be that as it may, Waugh commented of the novel that it was "humanist, and said all I needed to state about humanism". He trusted that the fundamental twentieth century strife was among Christianity and Chaos, and displayed a turbulent world to exhibit that civilisation did not have in itself the ability to endure. Hence, in the Brazilian wilderness, Tony experiences what Davis terms "control without graceÂ ... mainstream feudalism unredeemed by the redeeming quality of Christianity". Todd is the image of humanist, skeptical power. 

The pundit Bernard Bergonzi alludes to Tony Last as "a destined Gothic legend", reverberating Waugh's clarification to his companion Henry Yorke that the topic of the book was "a Gothic man in the hands of savagesâfirst Mrs Beaver and so on, at that point the genuine ones". As indicated by Stannard, Waugh would in general judge a civilisation by its specialty, and particularly by its design, and English Gothic is a noteworthy leitmotif of the novel. Tony's acknowledgment of the degree of Brenda's disloyalty is depicted as "an entire Gothic worldÂ ... end up badly". Afterward, Tony discovers reason in his generally trivial voyage when he knows about the famous lost city from Messinger; he pictures it as Gothic in character, "a transfigured HettonÂ ... everything iridescent and translucent; a coral bastion delegated a green slope top sown with daisies". At the point when toward the finish of his journey he first gets a quick look at Todd's settlement, in his wooziness he sees, rather than the truth of mud hovels and destruction, "overlaid domes and towers of alabaster". 

Albeit dedicated to unique English Gothic, Waugh had blended perspectives on Gothic Revival design, favoring what he called "pre-Ruskin" to the "stodgy" later nineteenth century style in which he puts Hetton. He taught the craftsman in charge of the frontispiece in the primary release of the book to "structure the most noticeably awful conceivable 1860" style to delineate the house. The manual depiction of Hetton which opens the second section uncovers that, "once in the past one of the eminent places of the area, it was totally remade in 1864 in the Gothic style and is presently without intrigue". Accordingly, Tony's commitment is appeared to be to a bogus perfect; his statement and substitution in his space by white collar class beneficiaries speaks to what the essayist Brigid Brophy terms "an average sack of a phony Gothic Rome". 

"A Handful of Dust" first showed up in "Harper's Bazaar", as a sequential in five portions amid the mid year of 1934, utilizing the option, non-Brazilian closure. The total novel was first distributed in book structure in London, on 4 September 1934, by Chapman and Hall. It was a prompt accomplishment with the British open, and inside about a month had achieved its fifth impression. Around the same time it was issued in New York by Farrar and Rinehart, who were at first apathetic about the book and, as per Waugh's operator, tried on its sake. It has since been distributed in the United States by (among others) Dell Publishing (1959); Little, Brown (1977); and Barnes and Noble (2001). 

Since its first distribution the book has stayed in print, and has been replicated in numerous versions and unknown dialects. It was first distributed as a soft cover in 1951, by Penguin, who have reissued it routinely. In 1945 Bernard Grasset distributed an interpretation in French, after which the book was distributed in most European dialects, and furthermore in Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Arabic. 

The underlying basic reaction to the book, while generally complimentary in tone, was in any case quieted and meager. This general lack of consideration, Stannard induces, might have been an outcome of the prior serialization, which implied that the substance of the story was outstanding before the book showed up. "The Times Literary Supplement's" unknown commentator esteemed the novel "an investigation of purposelessness", whose saint is "so unequipped for helping himself that he does not merit making a difference". Subside Quennell in the "New Statesman" found the story both difficult and interestingâ"catastrophe and parody are associated"â however was not defeat by the episodes of silliness that had interfered with his perusing of prior books, for example, "Decay and Fall". If not thrilling, the book was "unquestionably the most develop and best composed novel that Mr Waugh has yet created". Plomer's "Observer" survey depicted the book as "another of [Waugh's] developed pearls", financially composed, holding the peruser's consideration all through and catching with accuracy the temperaments and rhythms of life as it was lived in specific quarters of society. 

The main unmistakably antagonistic audit was Oldmeadow's in "The Tablet", which stated that, after the restlessness in Catholic circles following the production of Waugh's past novel, his co-religionists "sensibly would have liked to discover Mr Waugh turning over a totally new leaf. He has not done as such". The survey blended artistic analysis with good lecturing, to which Waugh felt bound to protest freely. His companion, the writer Tom Driberg consented to put a notice in his "William Hickey" segment in the "Day by day Express", in which Waugh acknowledged completely Oldmeadow's entitlement to censure the scholarly nature of the work "in any terms he supposes reasonable". Be that as it may, he included, so far as his ethical addressing was concerned, Oldmeadow was "in the situation of a valet disguising in his lord's garments. Long work by a sovereign of the Church has enticed him to chimp his bosses, and, normally enough, he gives a raunchy and impudent execution". 

A large number of Waugh's companions and admirers gave the book unstinting acclaim, among them Rebecca West, Lady Diana Cooper, Desmond MacCarthy and Hilaire Belloc. Among those less excited were the author J.B. Priestley, who found the characters lightweight and uninvolving, and the passionately Catholic Katharine Asquith who thought the composing was splendid however the topic profoundly discouraging. The epic's basic standing developed consistently in the years following its distribution. In 1942 the American faultfinder Alexander Woollcott picked it as the best English epic in 100 years, a decision to a great extent embraced a few years after the fact by Frank Kermode. Sykes wrote in 1975 that "there are just five or six books of this century that can truly challenge it". 

In 2010 "Time" magazine put "A Handful of Dust" in its posting of the hundred best English-language books distributed since 1923 (the year the magazine started production), expressing: "If this is Waugh at his most distressing it's likewise Waugh at his most profound, most noxiously amusing". In the Modern Library's rundown of 100 best books, "A Handful of Dust" is set 34th in the "Board list", albeit unplaced in the reciprocal "Perusers' List". 

On 8 April 1968 BBC Radio 4 communicate "A Handful of Dust" as a radio play, in an adjustment by Denis Constanduros delivered by Brian Miller. Jack Watling and Stephanie Beacham played Tony and Brenda Last, with Rex Holdsworth as Mr Todd. Another radio adjustment, with Jonathan Cullen and Tara Fitzgerald in the primary jobs, was communicated as a two-section sequential in May 1996. In November 1982 an outfit give played out the work a role as a phase play, coordinated by Mike Alfreds, at the Lyric Theater, Hammersmith. A movie variant, coordinated by Charles Sturridge, was discharged in 1988, with James Wilby as Tony, Kristin Scott Thomas as Brenda, Judi Dench as Mrs Beaver and Alec Guinness as Mr Todd.
