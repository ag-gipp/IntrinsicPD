Before Hong Kong's exchange of power, the banner of Hong Kong was a pioneer Blue Ensign banner. The banner of provincial Hong Kong experienced a few changes in the last one and a half hundreds of years. 

In 1843, a seal speaking to Hong Kong was established. The plan depended on a neighborhood waterfront scene; three nearby traders with their business products can be found on the frontal area, a square-fixed ship and a garbage possess the center ground, while the foundation comprises of funnel shaped slopes and mists. In 1868, a Hong Kong banner was created, a Blue Ensign banner with an identification dependent on this "neighborhood scene", yet the structure was dismissed by Hong Kong Governor Richard Graves MacDonnell. 

In 1870, a "white crown over HK" identification for the Blue Ensign banner was proposed by the Colonial Secretary. The letters "HK" were excluded and the crown turned out to be full-shading three years after the fact. It is misty precisely what the identification looked like amid that timeframe, yet it was probably not going to be the "neighborhood scene". It ought to have been a crown or some likeness thereof, which may, or may not, have had the letters "HK" beneath it. In 1876, the "nearby scene" identification ( "Picture of "Ar Kwan" Guiding the British officer") was re-embraced to the Blue Ensign banner with the Admiralty's endorsement. 

An ensign for Hong Kong was allowed on 21 January 1959 by the College of Arms in London. The Hong Kong banner was modified around the same time to highlight the crest in the Blue Ensign banner. This structure was utilized authoritatively from 1959 until Hong Kong's move of power in 1997. From that point forward, the frontier banner has been appropriated by protestors, for example, on the yearly 1 July walks for general suffrage, as an "image of hostility towards the territory", alongside a blue banner highlighting the crest, utilized by those supporting freedom. 

Before Hong Kong's exchange of sway, between 20 May 1987 and 31 March 1988, a challenge was held among Hong Kong occupants to help pick a banner for post-pilgrim Hong Kong, with 7,147 structure entries, in which 4,489 entries were about banner plans. Modeler Tao Ho was picked as one of the board judges to pick Hong Kong's new banner. He reviewed that a portion of the structures had been somewhat amusing and with political turns: "One had a sledge and sickle on one side and a dollar sign on the other." Some plans were rejected in light of the fact that they contained copyrighted materials, for instance, the seal of Urban Council, Hong Kong Arts Festival and Hong Kong Tourism Board. Six structures were picked as finalists by the judges, yet were all later rejected by the PRC. Ho and two others were then asked by the PRC to submit new recommendations. 

Searching for motivation, Ho meandered into a patio nursery and got a "Bauhinia blakeana" bloom. He watched the symmetry of the five petals, and how their winding example passed on to him a dynamic inclination. This drove him to fuse the blossom into the banner to speak to Hong Kong. The plan was received on 4 April 1990 at the Third Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, and the banner was first formally raised seconds after 12 pm on 1 July 1997 in the handover function denoting the exchange of sway. It was lifted together with the national PRC banner, while the Chinese national song of praise, "Walk of the Volunteers" was played. The Union Flag and the frontier Hong Kong banner were brought down seconds before midnight.
