"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" rehashes the standard traditionalist plan of family, romance and marriage, yet it suggests that Indian family esteems are compact resources that can be maintained paying little respect to nation of living arrangement. To demonstrate this, Raj, a NRI who was raised in London, is depicted as the story's "hero", while Kuljeet, brought up in India, is depicted as the miscreant. This is an inversion of the jobs in run of the mill Indian movies, which more often than not depict Indians as being ethically better than Westerners. Here, NRIs are approved as potential model Indian natives. 

The story intends to catch the battle between conventional family esteems and the cutting edge estimation of independence. Despite the fact that Raj and Simran need to be as one paying little respect to her dad's arrangements for her, Raj attempts to prevail upon his sweetheart's dad as opposed to just eloping with her.

Trust me, nothing happened the previous evening." This addresses the Indian diaspora and their need to attempt and support their esteem framework, and the man's obligation to ensure the Indian lady's sexual virtue. In "The Routledge Encyclopedia of Films", Ranjani Mazumdar says the film has a running topic of unfulfilled wants, which is exemplified by Raj's dad guiding him to appreciate life since his very own was a battle, and Simran's mom advising her to flee with Raj since she was unfit to experience her very own fantasies. 

Scott Jordan Harris, composing for Roger Ebert's site, says the film's notoriety lies in its capacity to adequately pass on two restricting topics speaking to various parts of society.

While battling the old custom of the masterminded marriage, regardless it energized the significance of looking for parental assent, notwithstanding for an affection marriage.
