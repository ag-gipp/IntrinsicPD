Despite the fact that Mukerji was naturally introduced to the Mukherjee-Samarth family, in which her folks and relatives were individuals from the Indian film industry, she didn't seek to seek after a profession in film. Nonetheless, while still an adolescent she dallied with acting by assuming a supporting job in her dad's Bengali language film "Biyer Phool" (1996) and acknowledged a main job in the 1996 social show "Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat" on the request of her mom.

She increased more extensive acknowledgment for a supporting job in the sentiment "Kuch Hota Hai" (1998). The year 2002 denoted a defining moment for Mukerji when she was cast by Yash Raj Films as the star of the show "Saathiya". 

By 2004, Mukerji had built up herself as a main on-screen character of Bollywood with jobs in the lighthearted comedy "Murmur Tum" and the shows "Yuva" and "Veer-Zaara". She made further progress for depicting a hard of hearing, visually impaired and quiet lady in the acclaimed dramatization "Dark" (2005), a con lady in "Bunty Aur Babli" (2005) and a miserably hitched lady in "Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna" (2006). Mukerji then teamed up with Yash Raj Films on a few fruitless movies which drove commentators to moan about her selection of jobs. The semi-true to life spine chiller "Nobody Killed Jessica" (2011), in which she played an unshakable columnist, ended up being her first film industry hit in four years. She tailed it by featuring in the fruitful spine chillers "" (2012) and "Mardaani" (2014), and the parody dramatization "Hichki" (2018). The last developed as her most noteworthy earning discharge.

Her mom, Krishna Mukherjee, is a previous playback vocalist. Her senior sibling, Raja Mukherjee, is a movie maker and chief. Her maternal auntie, Debashree Roy, is a Bengali film performer and her fatherly cousin, Kajol, is a Hindi film on-screen character and her contemporary. Another fatherly cousin, Ayan Mukerji, is a scriptwriter and movie executive. Regardless of her folks and the vast majority of her relatives being individuals from the Indian film industry, Mukerji was uninterested in seeking after a profession in film. She stated, "There were at that point an excessive number of on-screen characters at home and I needed to be somebody extraordinary". 

Mukerji got her instruction at Maneckji Cooper High School in Juhu and graduated with a degree in Home Science from SNDT Women's University. She is a prepared Odissi artist and started learning the move structure while in the tenth grade. As a feature of a yearly convention, the Mukherjee family commends the celebration of Durga Puja in the rural neighborhood of Santacruz consistently. Mukerji, a rehearsing Hindu, participates in the celebrations with her whole family. 

In 1994, chief Salim Khan drew nearer Mukerji to assume the lead female job in his directorial, "Aa Gale Lag Jaa". Her dad disliked a full-time vocation in film at such a youthful age, so she dismissed the offer. At eighteen years old, Mukerji tried different things with acting by depicting a supporting job in her dad's Bengali language film "Biyer Phool" (1996). The film featured Prosenjit and Indrani Haldar in lead jobs and portrays the narrative of two sisters; Mukerji played the more youthful kin of Haldar's character. Before long, Khan moved toward her with another film offer to play the hero of the social show "Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat", Mukerji acknowledged the job because of her mom's request that she keep on pursueing following up on an exploratory premise. Before she started take a shot at the film, Mukerji prepared at Roshan Taneja's acting establishment. 

Mukerji depicted an assault injured individual who is compelled to wed her attacker in "Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat", which discharged in 1996. Despite the fact that the film was a business disappointment, Mukerji's execution was lauded, and she won an exceptional acknowledgment trophy at the yearly Screen Awards function. Following the film's less than impressive display in the cinema world, Mukerji came back to school to finish her training. Be that as it may, propelled by her cousin Kajol's accomplishment in Bollywood, she chose to seek after a full-time profession in movies. 

In 1998, Mukerji featured inverse Aamir Khan in Vikram Bhatt's "Ghulam" (1998), her first business achievement. In spite of the fact that her job in the film was little, the tune "Aati Kya Khandala" earned her far reaching acknowledgment. Because of Mukerji's broken voice surface, Bhatt contracted a naming craftsman with an a lot higher pitched voice to name for her lines. Whenever inquired as to whether the executive's choice to not utilize her voice in the film influenced her, she said that her voice was named as it "sometimes fell short for the character". 

Soon thereafter, Karan Johar cast Mukerji inverse Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in his directorial debut "Kuch Hota Hai". The job was initially composed for Twinkle Khanna, yet when she dismissed it, Johar marked Mukerji on the request of Khan and Aditya Chopra. Johar had initially expected that a naming craftsman name Mukerji's lines in the film, however she improved her lingual authority and in the long run named for her own lines. She depicted Tina Malhotra, an undergrad who is involved with Khan's character. Composing for "India Today", film commentator Nandita Chowdhury considered Mukerji to be the scene-stealer and included, "Overflowing oomph from each pore, she [..] substantiates herself a performing artist whose time has come." "Kuch Hota Hai" demonstrated a leap forward for Mukerji; it developed as a blockbuster in India and abroad with profit of over , and won eight Filmfare Awards, including a Best Supporting Actress trophy for Mukerji. 

Following the achievement of "Kuch Hota Hai", Mukerji assumed driving jobs in the social dramatization "Mehndi" (1998) and the satire "Hi Brother" (1999). Both these movies were basic and business frustrations which neglected to move her profession forward. 

By 2000, Mukerji needed to abstain from being type-given a role as a "standard Hindi film courageous woman" and therefore chose to depict all the more moving jobs notwithstanding the prototype glitzy female lead. Be that as it may, none of her film discharges in 2000 were especially prominent. In "Badal" and "Bichhoo", two male-driven activity dramatizations (both including Bobby Deol ahead of the pack), she assumed jobs that were met with little praise from the pundits however were effective in the cinema world. A supporting job in Kamal Haasan's bilingual film "Hello Ram" demonstrated additionally fulfilling. The film was a mostly fictionalized record of Mahatma Gandhi's death and Mukerji depicted the character of Aparna Ram, a Bengali teacher who is assaulted and killed amid collective mobs in Calcutta. The questionable topic of "Hello Ram" prompted poor film industry income, yet the film was widely praised and chosen as India's authentic section to the Oscars that year. Mukerji discovered achievement in the satire "Hadh Kar Di Aapne" yet her next "Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye" bombed fundamentally and industrially. The lighthearted comedy "Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega", notwithstanding, earned her a Best Supporting Actress assignment at Filmfare and was generally welcomed by the pundits and groups of onlookers. Padmaraj Nair of "Screen" observed Mukerji's job to be "unreasonably pitiful for her to substantiate herself" however included that "she is very sufficient in whatever scenes she has been given". 

The year 2001 was a baffling one for Mukerji. In a survey for her first arrival of the year, "Chori Chupke", a dramatization dependent on surrogate labor, film faultfinder Sukanya Verma observed Mukerji to be "impeded with a job that doesn't give her much extension other than sobbing and crying" and favored the "meatier" job of her co-star Preity Zinta. In "Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai" and "", films that neglected to accumulate acclaim, Mukerji played the adoration interests of Abhishek Bachchan and Anil Kapoor individually. In an audit for the last mentioned, Sarita Tanwar composed that "[Mukerji] has next to no to do aside from being a piece of some greatly picturised tunes". 

Mukerji's vocation denoted a defining moment in 2002 when Yash Raj Films, a main creation organization in India, cast her for two prominent preparations: "Mujhse Dosti Karoge!", a lighthearted comedy co-featuring Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor, and "Saathiya", a change of the Tamil film industry hit "Alaipayuthey". "Mujhse Dosti Karoge!" was intensely advanced before discharge and demonstrated a triumph universally, however neglected to procure benefits in India. The sentimental dramatization "Saathiya" demonstrated a noteworthy defining moment in her profession, winning her a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress notwithstanding a Best Actress assignment at a similar service. Mukerji was executive Shaad Ali's solitary decision to assume the lead job; he stated, "She was destined to assume this job. She looked the character. She looked defenseless. She looked the correct age. She was immaculate". The film co-featured Vivek Oberoi, and her fatherly auntie Tanuja, and demonstrated a monetary achievement. Mukerji's depiction of Suhani Sharma, a medicinal understudy who manages the pressures and discontent of being hitched at a youthful age, met with basic recognition. The BBC expressed that "Mukerji plays the character of a white collar class young lady with extraordinary conviction", and Udita Jhunjhunwala of "Late morning" included, "Her appearances and acting are downplayed in a job that accommodates her like a glove." 

In 2003, Mukerji supplanted Aishwarya Rai to assume the lead female job inverse Shah Rukh Khan in Aziz Mirza's sentiment "Chalte". Media reports proposed that Rai was supplanted in the wake of quarreling with her then sweetheart Salman Khan on the film's sets, however Shah Rukh Khan demanded that Mukerji had been the first decision for the job. The film's idea was like "Saathiya" and managed false impressions between a wedded couple. Mukerji stated, "[Unlike "Saathiya"], "Chalte" manages an increasingly develop and more profound type of adoration. It is about how a man and lady respond to circumstances. [..] You can't generally get altogether different with the characters, however you can set them against an alternate foundation". The film was generally welcomed by the two commentators and groups of onlookers, and the next year Mukerji got a second Best Actress designation at Filmfare. Additionally that year, she featured in Milan Luthria's lighthearted comedy "Chori" inverse Ajay Devgan, Sudhir Mishra's anticipation dramatization "Calcutta Mail", nearby Anil Kapoor and Manisha Koirala, and J.P. Dutta's gathering war film "LOC Kargil". None of these movies fared well basically or financially.

Taran Adarsh expressed, "Among the main women, it is Rani Mukerji who is the best of the part. The job requested a performing artist of substance and Rani more than satisfies the desires." She won the Best Actress grant for her featuring job in Kunal Kohli's "Murmur Tum" (2004), a rom-com around two resolved people who meet at various phases of their lives. The film set her inverse Saif Ali Khan and demonstrated one of the greatest business achievements of the year. "The Hindu" discovered Mukerji's depiction of Rhea Prakash to act naturally "certainly equipped" and Tanmaya Kumar Nanda of Rediff.com stated, "Rani is her typical gathered self, changing into the numerous tints of her character without any difficulty of a chameleon". 

Soon thereafter, Mukerji made further progress when Yash Chopra cast her nearby Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta in his sentimental show "Veer-Zaara". The film portrays the narrative of star-crossed sweethearts, Veer Pratap Singh (played by Khan) and a Pakistani lady, Zaara Hayaat Khan (played by Zinta); Mukerji assumed the job of Saamiya Siddiqui, a Pakistani legal advisor entangled in a court case including Singh. With an overall gross of over , "Veer-Zaara" rose as the most astounding earning film of the year; it was screened at the Berlin Film Festival and met with basic praise.

Rani for one, has consummated this." She won the Best Supporting Actress trophy at the IIFA Awards service, and got a designation in a similar classification at Filmfare. 

In 2005, "Standpoint" magazine distributed that Mukerji had set up herself as the best on-screen character of contemporary Hindi film. Her first film job that year was inverse Amitabh Bachchan in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's exceedingly acclaimed "Dark", a dramatization around a heavy drinker man who devotes his life to show a visually impaired and hard of hearing young lady how to impart. Bhansali composed the piece of the visually impaired hard of hearing young lady explicitly for Mukerji, who was at first reluctant to take on the job because of its "testing" topic. Once Bhansali authorized his confidence in her, she concurred and started seriously concentrating communication via gestures with experts at the Helen Keller Institute in Mumbai. "Dark" won a few honors including two National Film Awards and eleven Filmfare Awards, and Richard Corliss of "TIME" highlighted it as the fifth best film of the year. Mukerji's execution met with consistent recognition; "Domain" called the execution "amazing", "Filmfare" incorporated her work in their posting of Indian film's "80 Most Iconic exhibitions" and expressed, "Rani has left a permanent imprint with this job as a rule comes rare for most".

She played the title character of Vimmi "Babli" Saluja, a con lady. The film was the second most elevated earning film of 2005 and Mukerji's third real accomplishment in two sequential years. Film commentator Namrata Joshi composed that "Rani plays to the display easily" and Taran Adarsh composed that she "sinks her teeth into the job and turns out decisively". She tailed it with Amol Palekar's dream film "Paheli", rejoining her with Shah Rukh Khan. The film was a film industry flop in India however was given a solid global discharge; it was screened at the Sundance Film Festival and was India's accommodation for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards. Raja Sen of Rediff.com was inspired by the film just as Mukerji's execution which he called "another flawlessly had influence". Mukerji's fourth and last arrival of the year was the exceedingly foreseen period film "". Chief Ketan Mehta at first moved toward her for an appearance, which was formed into an "essential part" after she gave her agree to star in the film. Her job was that of Heera, a whore who frames the adoration enthusiasm of the title character (played by Aamir Khan). Derek Elley of "Assortment" referenced that Mukerji made "the majority of her feisty nautch-young lady," regardless of having "a little job for a star of her bore." 

Mukerji diverted down an idea from Mira Nair to star in the Hollywood film "The Namesake", picking rather to team up indeed with her companion Karan Johar in "Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna" (2006), a urban dramatization managing betrayal and broken connections. The prominent creation highlighted an outfit cast of Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Preity Zinta and Kirron Kher, and recounted to the narrative of two miserably hitched couples in New York which results in an additional conjugal issue.

The job won Mukerji a third continuous IIFA Best Actress Award and among different gestures, earned her a 6th Best Actress assignment at Filmfare. The ineffectively gotten drama "Baabul" was her last appearance that year. 

Following the disappointment of "Baabul", Yash Raj Films cast Mukerji in Siddharth Anand's family show "Ta Ra Rum Pum" in the job of a famous dashing driver's (played by Saif Ali Khan) spouse and the mother of two. Mukerji was eager to fill the role of a mother out of the blue, and demonstrated her character after her very own mom. Discharged in 2007, the film was a financial achievement, yet gotten blended responses from the faultfinders. Khalid Mohamed hailed Mukerji's execution as "close perfect" however Rajeev Masand suspected that neither she nor Khan "can make a big deal about an impression in light of the fact that their characters are so unidimensional and exhausting." 

The lady's movie "Laaga Chunari Mein Daag" from chief Pradeep Sarkar was Mukerji's second discharge that year. She portrayed the film as a "voyage of a young lady into womanhood and her penances for her family". Her depiction earned her a seventh Best Actress selection at Filmfare, she assumed the job of Vibhavari Sahay, a young lady of restricted methods who is compelled to moonlight as a whore to fight for her family. Jaya Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Konkana Sen Sharma and Kunal Kapoor co-featured in the film which discharged to poor film industry returns and little recognition from the faultfinders. "The Indian Express" noticed that Mukerji was in charge of "hold[ing] the film together, regardless of whether her part, both as the ingÃ©nue and the hooker, doesn't have freshness". 

Mukerji played a whore for the third time in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's "Saawariya", an adjustment of Fyodor Dostoevsky's "White Nights", co-featuring Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor. Mukerji stated, "I play altogether different sorts of whores in "Saawariya" and "Laaga Chunari Mein Daag". The lady in "Saawariya" has no issue with her calling, while in the other film it's totally unique". "Saawariya" was her solitary discharge in three years that was not delivered by Yash Raj Films. The film was a film industry flop and met with polarizing responses from the pundits. Mukerji's execution was gotten positively and she earned her second Filmfare designation that year, this time for Best Supporting Actress. Before the finish of 2007, Mukerji's ubiquity had started to wind down. Rediff.com ascribed this to her "tedious matching" with a similar arrangement of performing artists; "Hindustan Times" distributed that she had turned into a "restrictive Yash Raj champion" which frustrated different executives to approach her for jobs. 

After a progression of genuine jobs, Mukerji tried to have an influence that would be a "messiness breaker" for her. She found the job in Kunal Kohli's "Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic" (2008), a kids' film around a blessed messenger who comes to Earth to support four agitated children. In an especially searing audit, Khalid Mohamed censured Mukerji's selection of jobs and stated, "As a Geeta Poppins, she's one-dimensional, either dashing to the max grins or petulant frowns. Her outfits, as well, are uneasy-on-the-eyes". The film had low film industry returns and further added to a decrease in Mukerji's vocation prospects. An "India Today" article discussed her "coming up short on karma in the cinematic world" and referenced her decrease in supports. 

While trying to beat this decrease in her vocation, Mukerji shed pounds and experienced a total makeover. In 2009, she teamed up for the ninth time with Yash Raj Films on "Dil Bole Hadippa!", a lighthearted comedy inverse Shahid Kapoor. Mukerji had exclusive requirements from the film in which she played a cricket-fixated Punjabi town young lady taking on the appearance of a man; it was enormously advertised before discharge and had its reality debut at the Toronto International Film Festival. "The Economic Times" faultfinder Gaurav Malani was frustrated with the image and expressed, "Rani Mukherjee concocts a lively exhibition yet her fake wail cry whine do[es] not interest any longer. Likewise after a point you despise imagining the enchanting performing artist as the mustached male player." The film was Mukerji's fourth monetary disappointment in succession. At the point when interrogated regarding her ongoing spate of failures with the Yash Raj Films flag, she expressed, "A performer is here to act and pick extraordinary jobs and contents. I was getting incredible jobs from Yash Raj by then, jobs that any on-screen character would give an arm to do. I remain by those movies paying little mind to their destiny". Soon thereafter, she included as an ability judge for the Sony Entertainment Television unscripted TV drama "Move Premier League". She said that showing up on TV would make her "increasingly open" to the groups of onlookers and help her "gain perceivability" when she was "not doing an excessive number of movies". Mukerji did not show up in 2010. 

Film pundit Aniruddha Guha of "Day by day News and Analysis" depicted Mukerji's execution in the 2011 film "Nobody Killed Jessica" as "a standout amongst her best exhibitions till date". The film (co-featuring Vidya Balan) was Mukerji's first business accomplishment since "Ta Ra Rum Pum", and was particularly noted for being a triumph regardless of the nonattendance of a noticeable male on-screen character. The film was a semi-historical spine chiller dependent on the Jessica Lal murder case in which Mukerji played the anecdotal character of Meera Gaity, an indecent TV writer who is profoundly included with the case. To advance the film, she repeated the job of Gaity on the "C.I.D." TV arrangement. In a meeting with "The Telegraph" she stated, "It was such an alternate job to depict. It wasn't a job that was regular of a Hindi film courageous woman. Meera was progressively similar to a legend. It was a character that really took the story forward. [..] Meera made a great deal of things occur. It wasn't something that I had ever done previously. I really needed to play a man!" Certain commentators, in any case, were condemning of her execution, including Anupama Chopra of NDTV, who called her job, "the deadly, false note in "Nobody Killed Jessica"," contending that "the character is composed externally and Rani's depiction of her is similarly worn-out. It's about facades. She contends a ton and gladly marks herself a bitch however her hair stays splendidly set up and at last, she even gets the chance to complete a hero like moderate movement walk." Nonetheless, the job earned her few honors and assignments, including a third Best Supporting Actress trophy at Filmfare. 

After the achievement of "Nobody Killed Jessica", Mukerji acknowledged a main job in Sachin Kundalkar's "Aiyyaa" (2012), a satire of habits co-featuring Prithviraj. She played Meenakshi Deshpande, a lady with an increased feeling of smell who builds up an uneven fascination towards Prithiviraj's character. Basically and monetarily fruitless. Rediff.com condemned her choice to star in the film, composing that she "gets no help from the manner in which her character is composed". More noteworthy achievement wanted her depiction of Roshni Shekhawat, a mother who has lost her single tyke in a sailing mishap, in Reema Kagti's suspenseful thrill ride "". Co-featuring Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor, the film had overall income of over . Ronnie Schieb of "Assortment" portrayed Mukerji as "striking in an unobtrusively thoughtful job", and she got Best Supporting Actress assignments at a few honor functions, including Filmfare. 

The next year, Mukerji featured in the compilation film "Bombay Talkies" comprising of four short movies. Mukerji was a piece of the fragment entitled "Ajeeb Dastaan Hai Yeh" in which she played Gayatri, a columnist who finds that her better half (played by Randeep Hooda) is gay; it was her fourth cooperation with executive Karan Johar. The film was screened at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival as a major aspect of the century year festivities of Indian film. Regardless of poor film industry returns, "Bombay Talkies" met with boundless basic recognition, with commendation coordinated to Johar's section. Tushar Joshi of "Every day News and Analysis" said that Mukerji was effective in "demonstrating [that] she's the ruler of nuance with regards to peeling off the make-up and giving herself a chance to fly". 

In 2014, Mukerji showed up in Pradeep Sarkar's wrongdoing spine chiller "Mardaani", in which she assumed the lead job of Shivani Shivaji Roy, a Maharashtrian policewoman engaged with a capturing case that drives her to reveal mysteries of human dealing in India. She took on the job "to demonstrate all young ladies what actually, what the world has come to, and how they have to ensure themselves". In planning, she interfaced with senior authorities of Mumbai's wrongdoing branch, and took in the Israeli self-protection procedure of Krav Maga. Rajeev Masand observed Mukerji to be the prime resource of the film, including that by "contributing Shivani with both physical quality and enthusiastic fearlessness, she gives us a legend that is hard not to pull for". Composing for "Hindustan Times", Anupama Chopra additionally applauded her execution, composing that she "permeates Shivani with steely determination yet in addition gives her enthusiastic profundity". The film was a business achievement and gathered Mukerji another Best Actress selection at Filmfare. 

Following the introduction of her tyke, Mukerji took a four-year break to concentrate on her little girl and was influenced by her better half, Aditya Chopra, to come back to acting. She was quick to deal with a venture that would oblige her parental responsibilities and discovered it in the satire dramatization "Hichki" (2018). Motivated by Brad Cohen's personal history "Front of the Class", the film recounts to the narrative of Naina Mathur, a hopeful instructor experiencing Tourette disorder who must substantiate herself by teaching underprivileged kids. In planning, Mukerji connected with Cohen and she prepared to influence her character's engine and vocal tics to seem unconstrained and not practiced. "Hichki" got commonly positive audits from pundits, with commendation coordinated at Mukerji's depiction of Tourette disorder. In a blended survey, Anna M. M. Vetticad of "Firstpost" composed that Mukerji "lifts "Hichki" each time she is on the scene, conveying compassion and appeal to Naina's character without at any minute requesting the group of onlookers' pity." It earned around the world, a dominant part of which originated from the Chinese film industry, and its prosperity drove Mukerji to express an enthusiasm for working all the more as often as possible later on. She increased another Best Actress selection at Filmfare. 

As of December 2018, Mukerji has resolved to star in a spin-off of "Mardaani", which will be coordinated by Gopi Puthran, who composed the primary film. 

In spite of steady media consideration, Mukerji stays protected about her own life. In contrast to numerous different superstars, Mukerji restrains her cooperations with the media and is in some cases named a loner; she said in a 2011 meeting, "Today performing artists have turned out to be progressively open with the media. In any case, this has represented an issue for performing artists like me in such a case that I don't do that, at that point I end up being called hermitic. So now I have changed myself and am effectively agreeable." Mukerji has teamed up every now and again and kept up a dear fellowship with on-screen characters Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, and movie producer Karan Johar. The idea of Mukerji's association with movie producer Aditya Chopra was the point of intense newspaper announcing in India, however she declined to openly discuss it. On 21 April 2014, she wedded Chopra at a private function in Italy. On 9 December 2015, she brought forth their little girl, named Adira.

Mukerji has been depicted by the pundits as a standout amongst the most cultivated performing artists of Bollywood. As a major aspect of a lifelong examination, Sukanya Verma noticed that Mukerji made a "somewhat eccentric introduction in movies" (she played an assault unfortunate casualty in "Raja Ki Aayegi Baarat"), and following a couple of long periods of wavering among progress and disappointment, she "accomplished the status of a star, entertainer and showgirl". Indo-Asian News Service revealed that amid her underlying years in the business, Mukerji was alluded to as the fruitful Kajol's poor cousin and was discounted by the commentators for being "stout" and "short".
