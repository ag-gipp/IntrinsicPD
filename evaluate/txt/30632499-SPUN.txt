The child of A. L. Jeffrey, Peter Jeffrey was conceived in Tenterfield, New South Wales, on 6Â July 1913. He was instructed at Church of England Preparatory School in Toowoomba, Queensland, and at Cranbrook in Sydney. Having invested energy as a jackaroo, by 1934 he was in his first year of building learns at Sydney University, dwelling in St Andrew's College. In December that year, he enrolled as an air cadet in the RAAF dynamic hold, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF). 

Jeffrey attempted flying guidance on the 1935 'B'Â (reservists) course directed by No.Â 1 Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton, and was charged as a pilot officer in July. Presenting with No.Â 22 (City of Sydney) Squadron from July 1936, he exchanged from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force (PAF) on a short-administration commission in May 1938. He was then relegated to No.Â 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, as a teacher. In January 1939, he was presented on Britain to go to the Specialists Signals Course at Royal Air Force College Cranwell, and was elevated to flight lieutenant in September. 

Finishing his course at Cranwell in November 1939, Jeffrey came back to Australia the next January as Signals Officer with No.Â 3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales. He continued flying obligations in June 1940, and presented out on the Middle East as a flight administrator with No.Â 3 Squadron on 15Â July. 

Cruising by means of Bombay, India, No.Â 3 Squadron landed at Suez, Egypt, in late August 1940. Alongside a large portion of his confidants, Jeffrey flew out of date Gloster Gladiator biplanes in help of the Australian sixth Division amid the North African Campaign; he guaranteed no triumphs at this stage. Advanced squadron pioneer, he took over No.Â 3 Squadron from Wing Commander Ian McLachlan on 13Â February 1941, by which time the unit had changed over to Hawker Hurricane monoplane contenders. Based at RAF Benina with regards to Benghazi when Jeffrey accepted order, No.Â 3 Squadron withdrew eastwards just hours in front of German tanks after Rommel propelled his hostile in April. The Australians were compelled to utilize ten distinct landing strips in the same number of days before the Allies regrouped. 

Jeffrey was flying a Hurricane when he guaranteed his first elevated triumph on 15Â April 1941. Following a trip of four German Junkers JuÂ 52 transports back to their base close Fort Capuzzo, Libya, he shot one down before it landed and strafed the other three on the ground, setting all ablaze. He was enhanced with the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for this adventure, just as his "untiring endeavors" and "exclusive requirement of efficiencyÂ ... under amazingly attempting conditions"; the honor was declared in the "London Gazette" on 13Â May. In the wake of changing over to P-40 Tomahawks that month, No.Â 3 Squadron participated in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign. Jeffrey scored the unit's first triumph in the new contender when he shot down on fire an Italian Junkers JuÂ 88 over the ocean close Beirut on 13Â June 1941. After two days he wrecked a Vichy French Martin 167 plane in southern Syria. Jeffrey was credited with another JuÂ 88 before the squadron came back to North Africa in September to help the Allied counter-assault against the Afrika Korps. He was referenced in despatches on 24Â September 1941. 

As leader of No.Â 3 Squadron, Jeffrey thought of creative methods for improving confidence despite living conditions that were "crude, best case scenario". On one event he organized settlement for his men close to a shoreline, well far from the commotion of evening shelling that was making them lose rest all the time. Another of his increasingly "radical thoughts" and enduring heritages was a joined chaos for all pilots in the battle zone, regardless of whether appointed or non-charged. The idea was at first disliked by Royal Air Force units, however when Air Vice Marshal "Mary" Coningham feasted at the mutual chaos on 11Â October 1941 and gave his endorsement, it flourished over the whole Desert Air Force; driving expert Clive Caldwell later set a similar thought in motion as authority of the RAAF's No.Â 1 (Fighter) Wing in Darwin, Northern Territory. One of No.Â 3 Squadron's flight sergeants reviewed that Jeffrey made it a standard for new pilots to become acquainted with their ground team to expand their feeling of comradeship, and furthermore gave one of his senior warrant officers uncommon duty regarding monitoring the area of Allied runways and petroleum supplies to guarantee that the unit was never shy of fuel or places to arrive in a crisis. 

Having been elevated to brief wing officer and designated wing pioneer of No.Â 234 Wing RAF prior in the month, Jeffrey was credited with an offer in the devastation of a Messerschmitt BfÂ 110 overwhelming contender on 20Â November. After two days he was shot down himself, yet was unharmed and figured out how to advance back to base. On 25Â November, above cheering Allied warriors assaulted in Tobruk, Jeffrey drove No.Â 3 Squadron and No.Â 112 Squadron RAF in an assault on Axis planes that brought about seven adversary airplane being demolished and eight harmed, against one Tomahawk lost. He scored his fifth solo triumph amid the commitment, shooting down a BfÂ 110, and harmed another. On 30Â November, Jeffrey protected one of his old friends from No.Â 3 Squadron, Sergeant Pilot Allan Cameron, who had crash-arrived behind adversary lines. Nicknamed "Little", Cameron had the bulkiest casing of any man in the unit, and subsequent to landing Jeffrey needed to jettison his parachute to account for his traveler in the Tomahawk's cockpit. He by and by figured out how to take off and come back to put together, and Cameron proceeded to endure the war and become a pro all the while. For this and different accomplishments Jeffrey was granted the Distinguished Service Order on 12Â December 1941. Just as his salvage of the brought down pilot, the reference paid tribute to his "extraordinary achievement" as wing pioneer, his "fine battling soul" in coming back to base in the wake of having been shot down himself, and to his "grand initiative, boldness and ability" that had "contributed in an expansive measure to the triumphs accomplished". Toward the month's end, Jeffrey was presented back on Australia to serve in the South West Pacific. He was credited with an aggregate of five ethereal triumphs in the Middle East, in addition to one shared and one harmed, however he was viewed as "preservationist" in his scoring. 

Jeffrey touched base in Australia in January 1942, and the next month quickly assumed responsibility for RAAF Bankstown, New South Wales. On 4Â March he turned into the debut administrator of No. 75 (Fighter) Squadron, working recently conveyed P-40 Kittyhawks. Framing the squadron in Townsville, Queensland, Jeffrey was in charge of preparing it for the safeguard of Port Moresby, which would wind up one of the essential early fights in the New Guinea battle. Despite the fact that it included two different veterans of No.Â 3 Squadron in the Middle East, Flight Lieutenants "Old John" Jackson and Peter Turnbull, the greater part of the unit's pilots were untried, and Jeffrey had just nine days to impart in them fundamental standards of battle flying, gunnery and strategies. He gave over direction to Jackson on 19Â March, yet helped with shipping the Kittyhawks to Moresby two days after the fact, just to be shot upon by anxious enemy of air ship heavy armament specialists as he came in to arrive with Turnbull and two different pilots. Every one of the four flying machine were harmed, and Jeffrey came surprisingly close to death as a projectile flew past his skull and into the headrest of his seat. By 24Â March, No.Â 75 Squadron had effectively shot down a few Japanese thieves; having seen it "immediately settled as a battling unit", Jeffrey came back to Australia. He quickly started stirring up a second new Kittyhawk unit for administration in New Guinea, No. 76 (Fighter) Squadron. Situated in Townsville at this stage, it was along these lines directed by Peter Turnbull and joined No.Â 75 Squadron in the Battle of Milne Bay.

At first based at Port Pirie, South Australia, the unit migrated to Mildura, Victoria, the next month, preparing pilots for battle in such air ship as Kittyhawks, CAC Boomerangs and Supermarine Spitfires.

Jeffrey wedded Colleen Crozier at Toorak Presbyterian Church in Melbourne on 14Â May; his best man was individual expert and No.Â 3 Squadron veteran Alan Rawlinson. The couple had two children.

No.Â 1 Wing blocked a few pillagers in late September yet none came in October; the keep going Japanese assault on northern Australia occurred on 12Â November. Jeffrey was elevated to brief gathering commander in December. 

On 8Â March 1944, Jeffrey desperately dispatched two of his squadrons to the region of Perth, Western Australia, in light of worries that a Japanese maritime power would strike the territory, yet it ended up being a failed foray; no assault resulted, and the squadrons were coordinated to profit to Darwin for 20Â March. He drove the wing in its first hostile strafing task on 18Â April, assaulting Japanese positions in the Babar Islands. The following month, he sent his home office and two squadrons to Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia to secure offices that had been set up to refuel the British Eastern Fleet preceding Operation Transom. On 5Â September 1944, Jeffrey drove No.Â 1 Wing to the Tanimbar Islands and strafed focuses in Selaru. Later he talked about the mission with Caldwell, who was then ordering No.Â 80 (Fighter) Wing and had followed along to decide whether such long-go tasks may be beneficial for his squadrons. Jeffrey proclaimed that the excursion was a squandered exertion and he had just attempted it to avert, in Caldwell's words, "the assurance of his pilots going totally down the channel". The next month, Jeffrey was prescribed to be referenced in despatches for "courageous and recognized administration" in North-Western Area; the honor was gazetted on 9Â March 1945. Withdrawing No.Â 1 Wing, in November he came back to the direction of No.Â 2 OTU, in which job he saw out the remainder of the war. 

Following the discontinuance of threats, No.Â 2 OTU was decreased to the status of a consideration and-upkeep unit, and Jeffrey's bonus was ended on 6Â June 1946. Having been exchanged to the RAAF save upon his retirement, he looked for readmission to the PAF in August that year, without progress. He at that point took up cultivating, acquiring a property on the Murray River. In April 1951 he again connected to rejoin the PAF and this time was conceded a commission as a wing administrator. Throughout the following two years he held preparing posts in Victoria, right off the bat at the RAAF Staff College, Point Cook, and in 1952 at Central Flying School, East Sale. The next year he moved toward becoming Deputy Director of Operations at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne.

Organizing weapons preliminaries at Woomera Rocket Range, Jeffrey and his care staff were based at first at RAAF Base Mallala however later moved to Edinburgh landing strip, at that point some portion of Salisbury and possessed by the Department of Supply. On 17Â January 1955, he turned into the debut Officer Commanding RAAF Base Edinburgh, and supervised the exchange of units from Mallala amid the year. He gave over direction of the base in April 1956, and left the Air Force on 14Â May. Coming back to private life, Jeffrey settled in Queensland and moved toward becoming accomplice in a stock broking firm at Surfers Paradise. He later turned into a grazier, running a sheep and steers property at Emerald in Queensland's Central Highlands.
