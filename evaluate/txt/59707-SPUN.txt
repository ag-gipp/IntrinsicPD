1930 FIFA World Cup 

The 1930 FIFA World Cup was the debut FIFA World Cup, the big showdown for men's national affiliation football crews. It occurred in Uruguay from 13 to 30 July 1930. FIFA, football's universal overseeing body, chose Uruguay as host country, as the nation would praise the centennial of its first constitution, and the Uruguay national football crew had effectively held their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the dominant part at the Estadio Centenario, which was worked for the competition. 

Thirteen groups (seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America) entered the competition. Just a couple of European groups partook due to the trouble of heading out to South America. The groups were partitioned into four gatherings, with the champ of each gathering advancing to the semi-finals. The initial two World Cup matches occurred all the while, and were won by France and the United States, who vanquished Mexico 4â 1 and Belgium 3â 0, separately. Lucien Laurent of France scored the principal objective in World Cup history, while US goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas posted the primary authority "clean sheet" in the competition. 

Argentina, Uruguay, the United States and Yugoslavia each won their particular gatherings to meet all requirements for the semi-finals. In the last, has and pre-competition top choices Uruguay crushed Argentina 4â 2 before a horde of 68,346Â people, and turned into the primary country to win the World Cup. 

The primary World Cup was the just a single without capability. Each nation partnered with FIFA was welcome to contend, and given a due date of 28 February 1930 to acknowledge. A lot of intrigue was appeared by countries in the Americas; Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and the United States all entered. An aggregate of seven South American groups partook, more than in any ensuing World Cup Finals. Nonetheless, in view of the long and exorbitant trek by ship over the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of nonappearance required for players, not very many European groups were slanted to participate. Some wouldn't face travel to South America in any conditions, and no European sections were gotten before the February due date. While trying to increase some European investment, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of welcome to The Football Association, despite the fact that the British Home Nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) had left FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929. Two months before the beginning of the competition, no group from Europe had formally entered. 

FIFA president Jules Rimet interceded, and in the long run four European groups made the outing via ocean: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, overseen by Constantin RÄdulescu and instructed by their skipper Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the challenge following the mediation of recently delegated King CarolÂ II. He chose the squad by and by, and consulted with businesses to guarantee that the players would even now have employments upon their arrival. The French entered at the individual mediation of Rimet, yet nor France's star safeguard Manuel Anatol nor the group's normal mentor Gaston Barreau could be induced to make the excursion. The Belgians took part at the prompting of German-Belgian FIFA VP Rodolphe Seeldrayers. 

The Romanians boarded the SS "Conte Verde" at Genoa, Italy, the French were grabbed at Villefranche-sur-Mer, France on 21 June 1930; and the Belgians left at Barcelona, Spain. The "Conte Verde" conveyed Rimet, the trophy and the three assigned European officials: the Belgians Jean Langenus and Henri Christophe, alongside Thomas Balway, a Parisian who may have been English. The Brazilian group were gotten when the watercraft docked in Rio de Janeiro, on 29 June before landing in Uruguay on 4 July. Yugoslavia voyaged through the mail steamship "Florida" from Marseille, France. 

In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia there were questions about their interest at first. Since the Croatians chose to blacklist the national group, King Alexander I would not like to fund the entire thought, yet at last they found an answer. Belgrade, Yugoslavia football affiliation authorities chose to round up just local (Serbian) star players, for the most part from two opponent Belgrade clubs, BSK and SK Jugoslavija, with an extra three Serbs who played for French clubs (Ivan Bek among them). 

Accordingly, the Yugoslavia group was only comprised of Serbian players; and with the two greatest stars of the group, Blagoje MarjanoviÄ ("MoÅ¡a") and Aleksandar TirnaniÄ ("Tirke"), both from BSK, they were prepared for a trek to South America to speak to Yugoslavia in the World Cup. The Yugoslavians were the most youthful group in the World Cup; with a normal age of 21 years and 258 days. After their first match, against Brazil, they got another epithet "The Ich-es" or "Ichachos" (in Spanish) by the Uruguayan press; alluding to the vast majority of the player's surnames that wound up with the "- iÄ" or "- viÄ" postfix, which is very basic for Serbian last names. They made the jointâ greatest progress in both Yugoslav and Serbian ensuing World Cup footballing history, by gaining fourth spot, an outcome that would be rehashed in 1962. 

Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, Hungary and Uruguay all held up applications to have the occasion. Uruguay's offered turned into the reasonable choice after the various nations pulled back their offers. 

All matches occurred in Montevideo. Three arenas were utilized: Estadio Centenario, Estadio Pocitos, and Estadio Parque Central. The Estadio Centenario was assembled both for the competition and as a festival of the centennial of Uruguayan freedom. Planned by Juan Scasso, it was the essential arena for the competition, alluded to by Rimet as a "sanctuary of football". With a limit of 90,000, it was the biggest football arena outside the British Isles. The arena facilitated 10 of the 18Â matches, including both semi-finals and the last. In any case, a hurried development plan and deferrals brought about by the stormy season implied the Centenario was not prepared for use until five days into the competition. Early matches were played at littler arenas generally utilized by Montevideo football clubs Nacional and PeÃ±arol, the 20,000 limit Parque Central and the Pocitos. 

Fifteen refs took an interest in the competition: four Europeans â two Belgians (Henri Christophe and John Langenus), a Frenchman, and a Romanian (Constantin RÄdulescu, additionally the Romanian group mentor), and eleven from the Americas â among them six Uruguayans. So as to wipe out contrasts in the utilization of the Laws of the Game, the officials were welcome to one short gathering to resolve the most clashing issues emerging from the amusement. 

Of all the refereeing arrangements, the two that pulled in most consideration were that of Gilberto de Almeida RÃªgo in the match among Argentina and France, in which the Brazilian arbitrator blew for full-time six minutes early, and that of the Bolivian Ulises Saucedo's in the Argentina and Mexico experience, which Argentina won 6â 3. Amid the amusement Saucedo, who was additionally the mentor of Bolivia, granted three punishments. 

Coming up next is the rundown of authorities to fill in as arbitrators and linesmen. Authorities in italics were just utilized as linesmen amid the competition. 

The 13 groups were drawn into four gatherings, with Group 1 containing four groups, and the others containing three. Each gathering played a round-robin position, with the four gathering victors advancing to the knockout semi-last stage. 

Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, and the United States were seeded, and were kept separated in the draw, which occurred in Montevideo once every one of the groups arrived. 

Since there were no passing diversions, the opening two matches of the competition were the principal World Cup recreations at any point played, occurring at the same time on 13 July 1930; France beat Mexico 4â 1 at the Estadio Pocitos, while the United States crushed Belgium 3â 0 in the meantime at the Estadio Gran Parque Central. France's Lucien Laurent was the scorer of the main World Cup objective. 

The main gathering was the just a single to contain four groups: Argentina, Chile, France and Mexico. Two days after France's triumph over Mexico, they confronted aggregate top choices Argentina. Wounds ruined France; goalkeeper Alex ThÃ©pot needed to leave the field after 20Â minutes, and Laurent, after a furious handle by Luis Monti, burned through a large portion of the match limping. Nonetheless, they waited for the majority of the match, just capitulating to a 81st-minute objective scored from a Monti free kick. The diversion included an administering debate when official Almeida RÃªgo mistakenly blew the last whistle six minutes ahead of schedule, with Frenchman Marcel Langiller clear on objective; play just continued after dissents from the French players. In spite of the fact that France had played twice in 48 hours, Chile still couldn't seem to play their first match. They confronted Mexico the next day, picking up an agreeable 3â 0 win. 

France's last match, against Chile, highlighted the primary extra shot of the World Cup . The principal goalkeeper to spare a punishment was Alex ThÃ©pot of France on 19 July 1930, sparing from Chile's Carlos Vidal in the 30th moment of the match. In Argentina's second match, against Mexico, three extra shots were granted.

Guillermo StÃ¡bile scored a cap trap in his worldwide presentation as Argentina won 6â 3, in spite of the nonattendance of their chief Manuel Ferreira, who had come back to Buenos Aires to take a law test. Capability was chosen by the gathering's last match, challenged by Argentina and Chile, who had beaten France and Mexico, separately. The diversion was damaged by a fight started by a foul on Arturo Torres by Monti. Argentina won 3â 1 against their neighbors and progressed to the semi-finals. 

The second gathering contained Brazil, Bolivia and Yugoslavia. Brazil, the gathering seeds, were required to advance, however in the gathering's opening match, out of the blue lost 2â 1 to Yugoslavia. Going into the competition Bolivia had never recently won a global match. For their opener they paid tribute to the hosts by wearing shirts each embellished with a solitary letter, spelling "Viva Uruguay" as the group arranged. Both of Bolivia's matches pursued a comparative example, a promising begin steadily changing into overwhelming thrashing. Against Yugoslavia, they waited for an hour prior to yielding, however were four objectives somewhere near the last whistle. Adversity had its impact; a few Bolivian objectives were denied. Against Brazil, when the two groups had just pride to play for, the score was 1â 0 to Brazil at half-time. Brazil included three more in the second half, two of them scored by the multi-sportsman Preguinho. Yugoslavia fit the bill for the semi-finals. 

Hosts Uruguay were in a gathering with Peru and Romania. The opening match in this gathering saw the main player ejection in the challenge, when PlÃ¡cido Galindo of Peru was expelled against Romania. The Romanians made their man preference pay; their 3â 1 success included two late objectives. This match had the littlest horde of any in World Cup history. The official participation was 2,459, yet the real figure is commonly acknowledged to be around 300. 

Due to development delays at Estadio Centenario, Uruguay's first match was not played until five days into the competition. The first to be held at the Centenario, it was gone before by a service out of appreciation for the Uruguayan century festivities. The Uruguayan group went through the a month going before the match in a preparation camp, at which severe order was worked out. Goalkeeper AndrÃ©s Mazali was dropped from the squad for breaking a time limit to visit his significant other. One hundred years to the day of the making of Uruguay's first constitution, the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1â 0. Onlookers commended Peru's resistance, and this ended up being the main competition coordinate in which Uruguay scored just a single objective. The outcome was seen as a poor act by the Uruguayan press, however praised in Peru. Uruguay accordingly vanquished Romania effortlessly, scoring four first half objectives to win 4â 0. 

The fourth gathering contained Belgium, Paraguay and The United States. The American group, which contained countless tops, were supposedly nicknamed "the shot-putters" by an anonymous source in the French unexpected. They beat their first adversaries, Belgium, 3â 0. The simplicity of the triumph was unforeseen; Uruguayan paper "Imparcial" composed that "the expansive score of the American triumph has truly astonished the specialists". Belgian reports moaned about the condition of the pitch and refereeing choices, guaranteeing that the second objective was offside. The gathering's second match, played in blustery conditions, saw the main competition cap trap, scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States against Paraguay. Until 10 November 2006, the main cap trap that FIFA recognized had been scored by Guillermo StÃ¡bile of Argentina, two days after Patenaude; in any case, in 2006 FIFA declared that Patenaude's case to being the principal cap trap scorer was substantial, as an objective recently alloted to partner Tom Florie was reattributed to Patenaude. With the United States having verified capability, the last match in the gathering was a dead elastic. Paraguay beat Belgium by a 1â 0 edge. 

The four gathering champs, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Uruguay and the United States, moved to the semi-finals. The two semi-last matches saw indistinguishable scores. The main semi-last was played between the US and Argentina on a downpour splashed pitch. The United States group, which included six British-conceived players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy following ten minutes to a broken leg as the match wound up rough. A Monti objective part of the way through the primary half gave Argentina a 1â 0 half-time lead. In the second a large portion of, the quality of the United States group was overpowered by the pace of the Argentinian assaults, the match completing 6â 1 to Argentina. 

In the second semi-last there were shades of the 1924 Summer Olympics coordinate among Yugoslavia and Uruguay. Here, however, Yugoslavia took an unexpected lead through VujadinoviÄ. Uruguay at that point took a 2â 1 lead. At that point in the blink of an eye before half-time Yugoslavia had an objective refused by a questionable offside choice. The hosts scored three more in the second half to win 6â 1, Pedro Cea finishing a cap trap. 

The now-conventional third spot play-off was not set up until 1934, so the arrangement of the 1930 World Cup is special in not recognizing the third and fourth set groups. Incidental sources, prominently a FIFA Bulletin from 1984, erroneously suggest that a third-place coordinate happened and was won 3â 1 by Yugoslavia. Records vary regarding whether a third-place coordinate was initially planned. As per a 2009 book by Hyder Jawad, Yugoslavia wouldn't play a third-place coordinate since they were angry with the refereeing in their semi-last against Uruguay. 

Toward the finish of the title, the commanders of the United States group (Tom Florie) and Yugoslavia (Milutin IvkoviÄ) both got bronze decorations. However a FIFA specialized advisory group report on the 1986 World Cup included full review rankings of all groups at all past World Cup finals; this report positioned the United States third and Yugoslavia fourth, because of a superior objective contrast on generally indistinguishable records, a training since proceeded by FIFA. In 2010, the child of Kosta HadÅ¾i, the head of Yugoslav assignment at the 1930 World Cup and the VP of the Football Association of Yugoslavia at the time, asserted that Yugoslavia, as a group, has been granted one bronze award, which has been kept by HadÅ¾i himself and his family for the accompanying 80 years. As per this source, Yugoslavia was put third as a result of the semi-finals misfortune to the inevitable bosses, Uruguay. 

The resonating successes for Uruguay and Argentina in the semi-finals implied the last was a rehash of the matchup in the 1928 Olympic last, which Uruguay had won 2â 1 after a replay. 

The last was played at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Sentiments ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine supporters crossed the stream with the rallying call "Victoria o muerte" ("triumph or passing"), dispersing any vulnerability concerning whether the competition had caught the creative energy of the general population. The ten pontoons reserved to convey Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo demonstrated insufficient, and any number of arranged specialty endeavored the intersection. An expected 10â 15,000 Argentinians made the outing, however the port at Montevideo was overwhelmed to the point that many did not make landfall before commencement, not to mention achieve the arena. At the arena, supporters were looked for weapons. The entryways were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before commencement, and around early afternoon the ground was full, the official participation 93,000. A difference dominated the development to the match as the groups neglected to concur on who ought to give the match ball, constraining FIFA to mediate and announce that the Argentine group would give the ball to the main half and the Uruguayans would give their own to the second. Uruguay rolled out one improvement from their semi-last line-up. Castro supplanted Anselmo, who passed up a great opportunity because of ailment. Monti played for Argentina in spite of getting demise dangers on the eve of the match. The ref was Belgian John Langenus, who just consented to administer a couple of hours before the amusement, having looked for confirmations for his security. One of his solicitations was for a pontoon to be prepared at the harbor inside one hour of the last whistle, on the off chance that he expected to make a fast break. 

The hosts scored the opening objective through Pablo Dorado, a low shot from a situation on the right. Argentina, showing prevalent passing capacity, reacted firmly. Inside eight minutes they were back on level terms; Carlos Peucelle got a Ferreira through-ball, beat his marker and evened out. In the blink of an eye before half-time driving competition goalscorer Guillermo StÃ¡bile gave Argentina a 2â 1 lead. Uruguay commander Nasazzi dissented, keeping up that StÃ¡bile was offside, yet without much of any result. In the second half Uruguay bit by bit ended up ascendant. Soon after Monti botched an opportunity to make the score 3â 1, Uruguay assaulted in numbers, and Pedro Cea scored an equalizer. After ten minutes an objective by Santos Iriarte gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4â 2 to seal the success. Langenus finished the match a moment later, and Uruguay in this way included the title World Cup victors to their mantle of Olympic bosses. Jules Rimet displayed the World Cup Trophy, which was later named for him, to the leader of the Uruguayan Football Association, RaÃºl Jude. The next day was pronounced a national occasion in Uruguay; in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, a horde tossed stones at the Uruguayan office. Francisco Varallo (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the last amazing, 30 August 2010. 

France, Yugoslavia and the United States every single played cordial in South America following the challenge. Brazil played France on 1 August, Yugoslavia on 10 August and the United States on 17 August, while Argentina facilitated Yugoslavia on 3 August. 

Uruguay's total objective contrast of +12 more than four amusements, at a normal of +3 for each match, remains the most noteworthy normal objective distinction per match of any World Cup champion, and the second most noteworthy of any World Cup Finals member, after Hungary in 1954. 

With eight objectives, Guillermo StÃ¡bile was the top scorer in the competition. Altogether, 70 objectives were scored by 36 players, with just a single of them credited as a claim objective. 

In 1986, FIFA distributed a report that positioned all groups in every World Cup up to and including 1986, in view of advancement in the challenge, in general outcomes and nature of the resistance. The rankings for the 1930 competition were as per the following:
