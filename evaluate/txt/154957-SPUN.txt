New Zealand national rugby association group 

The New Zealand national rugby association group, called the All Blacks, speaks to New Zealand in men's rugby association, which is known as the nation's national game. The group has won the last two Rugby World Cups, in 2011 and 2015 just as the debut competition in 1987. 

They have a 77% winning record in test coordinate rugby, and are the main worldwide men's side with a triumphant record against each adversary. Since their worldwide introduction in 1903, they have lost to just six of the 19 countries they have played in test matches. Since the presentation of the World Rugby Rankings in 2003, New Zealand has held the main positioning longer than every single other group joined. The All Blacks mutually hold the record for the most sequential test coordinate successes for a level one positioned country, alongside England. 

New Zealand rivals Argentina, Australia and South Africa in The Rugby Championship. The All Blacks have won the trophy multiple times in the challenge's twenty-three-year history. New Zealand have finished a Grand Slam visit four times1978, 2005, 2008 and 2010. The All Blacks have been named the World Rugby Team of the Year multiple times since the honor was made in 2001, and an All Black has won the World Rugby Player of the Year grant multiple times over a similar period. Fifteen previous All Blacks have been drafted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. 

The group's first match was in 1884, and their first worldwide test coordinate was in 1903 against Australia in Sydney. The next year, they facilitated their first since forever home test, a match against a British Isles side in Wellington. This was trailed by a 34-diversion (counting 5 tests) voyage through Europe and North America in 1905, where the group endured just a single thrashing their first since forever test misfortune, against Wales. 

New Zealand's initial regalia comprised of a dark pullover with a silver greenery and white knickerbockers. By the 1905 visit, they were wearing all dark, with the exception of the silver plant, and the name All Blacks dates from this time. The group play out a haka, a MÄori challenge or stance move, before each match. The haka has generally been Te Rauparaha's "Ka Mate", despite the fact that since 2005 "Kapa o Pango" has additionally been performed. 

Rugby unionalmost all around alluded to just as "rugby" in New Zealandwas acquainted with New Zealand by Charles Monro in 1870; Monro found the game while finishing his examinations at Christ's College, Finchley, England. The primary recorded amusement in New Zealand occurred in May 1870 in Nelson between the Nelson club and Nelson College. The principal commonplace association, the Canterbury Rugby Football Union, was framed in 1879, and in 1882 New Zealand's first internationals were played when New South Wales (NSW) visited the nation. NSW did not confront a New Zealand agent group but rather played seven common sidesthe visitors won four diversions and lost three. After two years the primary New Zealand group to travel abroad visited New South Wales; where New Zealand won each of the eight of their recreations. 

A secretly composed British group, which later turned into the British and Irish Lions, visited New Zealand in 1888. No test matches were played, and the side just played commonplace sides. The British players were drawn basically from Northern England, however there were agents from Wales and Scotland. 

In 1892, after the peddling of common heads by Ernest Hoben, the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) was shaped by most of New Zealand's commonplace associations, however did exclude Canterbury, Otago or Southland. The first authoritatively endorsed New Zealand side visited New South Wales in 1893, where the Thomas Ellison captained group won nine of their ten matches. The next year New Zealand played its first home "global" amusement, losing 8â 6 to New South Wales. The group's first evident test coordinate happened against Australia on 15 August 1903 at the Sydney Cricket Ground before more than 30,000 observers, and brought about a 22â 3 triumph. 

An agent New Zealand group originally visited the British Isles in 1905. The side is currently known as the "Firsts", as the "All Blacks" name developed amid this visit when, as per colleague Billy Wallace, a London paper detailed that the New Zealanders played as though they were "all backs". Wallace guaranteed that on account of a typographical blunder, consequent references were to "All Blacks". This record is undoubtedly a mythbecause of their dark playing strip, the side was most likely alluded to as the "Blacks" before they left New Zealand. Despite the fact that the name All Blacks no doubt existed before the excursion, the visit popularized it. 

The Originals played 35 coordinates on visit, and their solitary misfortune was a 3â 0 annihilation to Wales in Cardiff. The match has gone into the fables of the two nations in light of a discussion about whether All Black Bob Deans scored an attempt which would have earned his group a 3â 3 draw. As opposed to the accomplishment of the Originals on the field, the group antagonized some in the Home Nations' rugby foundation; the two executives and the press griped that the All Blacks did not play the diversion inside the beginner and noble soul advanced by the International Rugby Football Board. This protest kept on hounding New Zealand groups until the 1930s. 

The accomplishment of the Originals had awkward ramifications for the beginner NZRFU. In 1907, a gathering of expert players was amassed to visit the British Isles and play rugby leaguea proficient branch of rugby association that was played by clubs that split from England's Rugby Football Union (RFU) because of contradictions over budgetary pay for players. At the point when the "All Golds", as the group came to be known, returned they set up rugby class in New Zealand, and an expansive number of players changed to the expert code. English and Welsh experts were frightened by the danger of demonstrable skill to rugby in New Zealand, and in 1908 an Anglo-Welsh side embraced a visit to New Zealand to help advance the beginner esteems under which they trusted game ought to be played. The travelers were crushed 2â 0 in the three-test arrangement by New Zealand, yet the Anglo-Welsh managed to draw the second test 3â 3. 

Global rugby was suspended amid the First World War, yet a New Zealand Services group competed in between administrations rivalry known as the King's Cup. After their takeoff from Europe the side visited South Africa before their arrival to New Zealand, and that visit made ready for a South African group to visit New Zealand in 1921. The Springboksas the South African group is knownplayed New Zealand in a test arrangement that finished all square. New Zealand directed an arrival visit to South Africa in 1928, and the test arrangement was again drawn; the two groups winning two tests each. 

The 1924 All Black vacationers to the British Isles and France were named "the Invincibles" on the grounds that they won each diversion. Notwithstanding, the group was denied of a potential thousand hammer when Scotland would not play them since they were vexed the visit was sorted out through the RFU as opposed to the IRFB. The primary British Isles side since 1908 visited New Zealand in 1930. Despite the fact that the Lions won the main test, the home side regrouped and proceeded to win the arrangement 3â 1. New Zealand visited the British Isles again in 1935â 36, losing just three gamesincluding two testsduring a 30-coordinate visit. In one of these misfortunes, Prince Obolensky broadly scored two endeavors to push England to a 13â 0 win; their first over New Zealand. 

In 1937, South Africa visited New Zealand and definitively won the test arrangement regardless of losing the primary test; this 1937 South African group was portrayed as the best group ever to leave New Zealand. It was not until 1949 that New Zealand next played the Springboks when they visited South Africa with Fred Allen as commander. Albeit each test against South Africa was close, New Zealand lost the arrangement 4â 0. 

In the meantime as an All Black group was visiting South Africa, Australia were visiting New Zealand. The two visits matched on the grounds that MÄori players were not ready to go to South Africa at the time, which means the Australians, played against a New Zealand group made up of the best MÄori and the save non-MÄori players, while the South Africans experienced the best pÄkehÄ (non-MÄori) players. On the evening of 3 September New Zealand, captained by Johnny Smith, were beaten 11â 6 by Australia in Wellington. New Zealand at that point lost their second test 16â 9, which gave Australia a Bledisloe Cup arrangement win in New Zealand out of the blue. 1949 was an "annus horribilis" for the All Blacks as they lost each of the six of their test matches, and the experience of playing two test arrangement at the same time has not been rehashed. 

The two back to back arrangement misfortunes to South Africa made their 1956 voyage through New Zealand exceedingly foreseen. New Zealand were captained by Bob Duff and instructed by Bob Stuart, and their 3â 1 arrangement win was their first over the Springboks and the Springboks' first arrangement misfortune that century. Amid the arrangement, New Zealand presented Don Clarke, and brought prop Kevin Skinner out of retirement to help secure the success. Skinner, a previous New Zealand boxing champion, had resigned from worldwide rugby, yet was persuaded to return for the third and fourth tests. One purpose behind Skinner's determination was to "sort out" the South African props, while Clarke become known as "The Boot" for his objective kicking. 

New Zealand's 3â 1 arrangement win over the Lions in 1959 turned out to be the beginning of a prevailing period in All Black rugby. This was trailed by the 1963â 64 visit to Britain and Ireland, driven by Wilson Whineray, in which New Zealand were denied of a Grand Slam by a scoreless draw with Scotland. The main misfortune on this visit was to Newport RFC, who won 3â 0 at Rodney Parade, Newport on 30 October 1963. The 1967 side won three tests against the home countries, yet was unfit to play Ireland due to a foot-and-mouth alarm. This visit shaped piece of New Zealand's longest series of wins, somewhere in the range of 1965 and 1970, of 17 test triumphs. This was likewise the longest test series of wins by any country at the time; it would be equalled by the Springboks in 1998, and outperformed by Lithuania in 2010. Despite the fact that the 1966 Lions were vanquished 0â 4 in their New Zealand visit, there was an inversion of fortune five years after the fact when the 1971 Lions, under the captaincy of Welshman John Dawes, beat New Zealand in a test arrangement, which remains the Lions' solitary arrangement triumph in New Zealand. 

The 1972â 3 vacationers barely missed a Grand Slam with a draw against Ireland. The visit was eminent for the sending home of prop Keith Murdoch, who was asserted to have been engaged with a fight in a Cardiff inn while praising the thrashing of Wales. It was on this visit New Zealand lost 9-3 out of an epic fight against Llanelli RFC covered with Welsh and British Lions tops 

In 1978, Graham Mourie captained New Zealand to their first Grand Slam, including a 13â 12 triumph over Wales. That diversion created discussion after New Zealand won as the consequence of a late punishment. Lock Andy Haden had plunged out of a line-out trying to gain a punishment, yet ref Roger Quittenden demanded the punishment was against Welsh lock Geoff Wheel for hopping off the shoulder of Frank Oliver. New Zealand's solitary misfortune on the visit was the renowned 12â 0 rout by Irish region Munster at Thomond Park. Later a play which concentrated on the misfortune was composed by John Breen, called "Alone it Stands". 

For the 1960 All Blacks voyage through South Africa, the South African experts demanded that Maori players be rejected from the group. The ensuing discussion prompted the New Zealand Rugby Union declining some other visit for the accompanying 10 years until the 1970 visit, when Maori players were acknowledged as "privileged whites". (See Halt All Racist Tours.) 

The 1976 All Blacks voyage through politically-sanctioned racial segregation South Africa created much debate and prompted the blacklist of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal by 33 African countries after the IOC would not boycott the group. New Zealand again neglected to win the test arrangement in South Africa: they didn't do as such until 1996, after the fall of politically-sanctioned racial segregation and the presentation of unbiased officials. The 1976 visit added to the Gleneagles Agreement being received by the Commonwealth Heads of State in 1977. 

The 1981 South African visit to New Zealand started challenges South Africa's politically-sanctioned racial segregation strategy, any semblance of which had not been seen in New Zealand since the 1951 waterfront question. The NZRU had welcomed the Springboks to visit as the Muldoon government wouldn't include legislative issues in game. Albeit New Zealand won the test arrangement, two of the visit's commonplace amusements were dropped and the entire visit was defaced by viciousness and challenge. The third and last test match of the visit is here and there known as the Flour Bomb test, as an enemy of politically-sanctioned racial segregation lobbyist in a Cessna light air ship dropped handouts, flares, a parachute-bolstered flag perusing "Biko" and flour bombs into Auckland's Eden Park all through the match, felling a New Zealand player. Amid the visit the nation experienced distress, and the visit significantly affected New Zealand society. 

The 1985 All Blacks visit to South Africa was dropped after lawful activity in light of the fact that it would break the NZRU's constitution. In 1986, a revolutionary visit to South Africa occurred that had not been approved by the NZRU and the group, named the Cavaliers, included numerous All Blacks. Those that took an interest in the visit got a restriction for two tests from the NZRU when they came back to New Zealand. Charges that players got installment for the visit were never demonstrated. 

New Zealand facilitated and won the debut World Cup in 1987 beating France 29â 9 in the last. New Zealand surrendered just 52 and scored 43 attempts in six amusements on the way to the title, beating Italy, Fiji, Argentina, Scotland, Wales and France. 

By the 1991 World Cup New Zealand were a maturing side, co-trained by Alex Wyllie and John Hart. In the wake of beating has England in the competition opener, they battled amid pool matches against the United States and Italy, and won their quarter-last against Canada. They were then thumped out by possible champs Australia 16â 6 in their semi-last at Lansdowne Road. In the wake of the competition, there were numerous retirements, including mentor Wyllie, who had appreciated a 86% success rate amid 29 tests in control. 

Laurie Mains supplanted Wyllie in 1992, and was given the activity of setting up the side for the 1995 occasion in South Africa. New Zealand were again one of the top picks to take the title. Their status as top picks was upgraded when a youthful Jonah Lomu scored four attempts against England in the 45â 29 semi-last win. They figured out how to take has South Africa to additional time in the last, before losing 15-12 to Joel Stransky's drop objective. 

The expert period in rugby association started in 1995, impelled by production of the SANZAR gathering (a blend of South Africa, New Zealand and Australia) which was shaped with the reason for selling communicate rights for two new rivalries, the household Super 12 rivalry and the Tri-Nations. The first Tri-Nations was challenged in 1996, with New Zealand winning every one of the four of their tests to take the trophy. After a 1996 Tri-Nations coordinate facilitated by South Africa, won 29â 18 by New Zealand, went before a different three-coordinate test arrangement between the opposite sides. Under new mentor John Hart and the captaincy of Sean Fitzpatrick, New Zealand won a test arrangement in South Africa out of the blue. Fitzpatrick appraised the arrangement win higher than the 1987 World Cup triumph in which he had taken an interest. 

The following three seasons saw blended outcomes for New Zealand, who won all their Tri-Nations tests in 1997 preceding losing the title without precedent for 1998. In 1998 New Zealand lost every one of the five tests in the Tri-Nations and Bledisloe Cup arrangement (two to South Africa and three to Australia), the first occasion when they had lost four tests in progression since 1949. The next year they endured their most noticeably bad test misfortune, 28â 7 to Australia in Sydney. At the 1999 World Cup soon thereafter, the All Blacks commanded their pool, giving England a 30â 16 rout at Twickenham. They progressed past Scotland 30â 18 in the quarter-finals to play France at Twickenham. After New Zealand completed the principal half 17â 10 ahead, France at that point created an acclaimed half of rugby to which New Zealand had no answer, winning 43â 31. Hart along these lines surrendered as mentor and was supplanted by co-mentors Wayne Smith and Tony Gilbert. 

Under Smith and Gilbert, New Zealand came next in the 2000 and 2001 Tri-Nations, and in neither one of the seasons did the side recover the Bledisloe Cupwhich had been lost in 1998.

They vanquished South Africa in their quarter-last, a group they had never beaten at the World Cup, 29â 9, however lost to Australia 22â 10 in the semi-last in Sydney. 

Graham Henry's residency as mentor started with a twofold triumph more than 2003 Rugby World Cup champs England in 2004. The two diversions had a total score of 72â 15, and England were kept attempt less. In spite of the triumphant begin to Henry's residency, the Tri-Nations was a blended accomplishment with two successes and two misfortunes. The challenge was the nearest ever, extra focuses chose the result, and New Zealand completing last.
