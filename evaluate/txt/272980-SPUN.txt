The call to open a school in West Texas started soon after pilgrims touched base in the zone during the 1880s. In 1917, the Texas council passed a bill making a part of Texas A&M to be in Abilene. Notwithstanding, the bill was revoked two years after the fact amid the following session after it was found Governor James E. Ferguson had erroneously detailed the site panel's decision of area. After new enactment go in the state house and senate in 1921, Governor Pat Neff vetoed it, refering to hard money related occasions in West Texas. Angry about Neff's veto, some in West Texas ventured to such an extreme as to suggest West Texas withdraw from the state. 

In 1923, the governing body chose, instead of a branch grounds, another college would better serve the locale's needs under enactment co-wrote by State Senator William H. Bledsoe of Lubbock and State Representative Roy Alvin Baldwin of Slaton in southern Lubbock County. On February 10, 1923, Neff marked the enactment making Texas Technological College, and in July of that year, a board of trustees started hunting down a site. At the point when the advisory group's individuals visited Lubbock, they were overpowered to discover occupants covering the roads to demonstrate support for facilitating the foundation. That August, Lubbock was picked on the main poll over other region towns, including Floydada, Plainview, Big Spring, and Sweetwater. 

Development of the school grounds started on November 1, 1924. After ten days, the foundation of the Administration Building was laid before 20,000 individuals. Representative Pat Neff, Amon G.
