Gillard built up the reason for "All Souls" from his conviction that a therapeutic office would be a perfect setting for an awfulness arrangement and his exploration on insights of passings that had occurred in an emergency clinic. Ice additionally felt that there was a nearby association between present day medication and the extraordinary. Despite the fact that the arrangement was set in Boston, shooting occurred in Montreal, Canada.

Basic reaction to "All Souls" was essentially positive; reporters adulated its utilization of ghastliness and paranormal components. Commentators had blended surveys for the show's substance and style when contrasted with other ghastliness and sci-fi TV arrangement, explicitly "The X-Files" and crafted by American essayist Stephen King. 

Portrayed as a "paranormal emergency clinic dramatization" by UPN, "All Souls" pursues the restorative staff working in the Boston showing medical clinic of a similar name. The zone has a history going back to the American Civil War. A photo taken amid the war is conspicuously highlighted in the arrangement, as it demonstrates people who still work as a major aspect of the staff. The hauntings at All Souls began amid the Civil War, when Dr. Abramson led investigates his patients following the passing of his three children in battle. The apparitions of Abramson's unfortunate casualties stay in the clinic to the present day.

It had recently worked as a mental emergency clinic, which was housed on the upper dimensions of the structure's pinnacle. 

The primary story incorporates "insights of more profound, great versus-insidious challenges". Taking motivation from the blood and gore movie classification, the arrangement incorporates "extraordinary closeups [and] unusual sexual changes". In the pilot scene, an enchantment scene with a specialist and a young lady closes when she is uncovered to be a body, and a few ladies pass on subsequent to being conceded for treatment. In spite of the fact that the arrangement pursues a particular folklore and progression, every scene has its very own independent story. 

UPN administrators had pitched the arrangement as following "youthful specialists in hazard at a spooky old Boston Hospital" who must battle with "a solid portion of unnerving paranormal events and grasping therapeutic crises". In the pilot scene, Dr. Mitchell Grace (Grayson McCouch) starts working at the clinic following moving on from therapeutic school. He had explicitly picked the All Souls therapeutic program, denying offers from the Mayo Clinic and the Yaleâ New Haven Hospital, because of his own association with the medical clinic. Beauty's dad kicked the bucket in 1978 while filling in as a janitor in the emergency clinic, in the wake of getting a baffling sickness. Elegance fills in as the show's lead character, and capacities as a criminologist just as a specialist while endeavoring to comprehend the internal activities of All Souls. As he works, Grace experiences both great and insidiousness phantoms, and finds restorative analyses are being led under the direction of the directorate. Spirits incorporate "a crazy lab rat and his Igor-like errand kid", and a lady wearing nineteenth century style driving a stroller through the corridors. Effortlessness is spooky by dreams of his dad, and is some way or another associated with the phantom Lazarus and Civil War specialists.

Beauty works intimately with a few partners amid his time at All Souls, however is the one of few individuals who is completely mindful of the clinic's powerful events. He teams up with enlisted nurture Glory St. Claire (Irma P. Corridor), who has a long history with the office and "knows beyond what she can say or, at any rate, clarify". She is portrayed by her clairvoyant forces. As indicated by St. Claire, "the dead have control" in the clinic and the "powers of good" living inside All Souls had prognosticated of Grace's landing for quite a few years. She associates with Grace by holding his hands to enable him to see the "tormented soul" in the emergency clinic. Effortlessness finds further help from Dr. Nicole De Brae (Serena Scott Thomas), Dr. Bradley Sterling (Daniel Cosgrove), and Patrick Fortado (Adam Rodriguez). De Brae goes about as the emergency clinic's head of staff and Sterling works nearby Grace as a therapeutic assistant. Fortado is Grace's dear companion, a paraplegic who has incredible expertise at hacking. The definite idea of De Brae's dependability is raised doubt about, and Tim Goodman of the "San Francisco Chronicle" thought about whether she will fill in as an affection intrigue or be uncovered as one of the emergency clinic's spirits.

"The Seattle Post-Intelligencer's" John Levesque felt that the system chose to create "All Souls" trying to locate another fruitful arrangement following the finish of "". While Levesque idea the shows were "promising", he didn't trust any of them were a "pummel dunk". 

Rodriquez at first would not try out as he needed to be a piece of the 2000 dramatization "The Street." After the makers reached him over and again, he read for the pieces of Fortado and Sterling multiple times and conversed with Spelling. After he was not thrown in "The Street," he acknowledged the piece of Fortado; he especially needed to chip away at a show delivered by Spelling.

Cosgrove couldn't help contradicting McCouch's assessment and trusted that the show's absence of progress was not fixing to the system explicitly. Rodriquez trusted that "All Souls" was ineffective as it seemed to be "only somewhat relatively revolutionary"; he felt that the program was more qualified for TV one to two years following its underlying communicate. The arrangement has never been discharged on DVD or Blu-beam, or authorized to on a web based spilling administration. 

"All Souls" has gotten positive basic criticism. Eric Mink of the "New York Daily News" lauded the show's utilization of ghastliness, and composed that it would "set the hauling knuckles of UPN's center group of onlookers each of the a-shiver".
