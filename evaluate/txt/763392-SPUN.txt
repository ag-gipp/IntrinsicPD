Skirmish of Red Cliffs 

The Battle of Red Cliffs, also called the Battle of Chibi, was an unequivocal fight battled toward the finish of the Han administration, around twelve years preceding the start of the Three Kingdoms time frame in Chinese history. It was battled in the winter of AD 208/9 between the partnered powers of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan and the numerically predominant powers of the northern warlord Cao. Liu Bei and Sun Quan effectively baffled Cao's push to overcome the land south of the Yangtze River and rejoin the domain of the Eastern Han tradition. The associated triumph at Red Cliffs guaranteed the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, gave them control of the Yangtze , and gave a line of guard that was the reason for the later production of the two southern conditions of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. The fight has been known as the biggest maritime fight in history as far as numbers included. 

Portrayals of the fight vary generally, and the area of the fight is savagely discussed . Despite the fact that its exact area stays dubious, most of scholarly guesses place it on the south bank of the Yangtze River, southwest of present-day Wuhan and upper east of Baqiu (present-day Yueyang, Hunan). 

By the early third century, the Han tradition, which had ruled China for just about four centuries (but with a 16-year interference, separating the administration into its Western and Eastern periods), was disintegrating. Head Xian had been a political nonentity since 189, with no power over the activities of the different warlords controlling their separate regions. A standout amongst the most dominant warlords in China was Cao, who, by 207, had brought together northern China and held absolute control of the North China Plain. He at that point finished an effective battle against the Wuhuan in the winter of that year, accordingly verifying his northern outskirts. Upon his arrival in 208, he was designated Chancellor, a position that allowed him supreme specialist over the whole majestic government . Quickly a while later, in the harvest time of 208, his military started a southern battle (; ). 

The Yangtze River in the zone of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan territories) was vital to the achievement of this system. In the event that Cao was to have any expectation of rejoining the sundered Han realm, he needed to accomplish maritime control of the center Yangtze and direction the key maritime base at Jiangling as a methods for access toward the southern locale . Two warlords controlled the locales of the Yangtze that were vital to Cao's prosperity: Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, controlled the zone west of the mouth of the Han River (generally including the region around the city of Xiakou and all region south of that district), and Sun Quan, who controlled the waterway east of the Han and the southeastern regions adjoining it . A third partner, Liu Bei, was living in asylum with Liu Biao at the army in Fancheng (in present-day Xiangyang), having fled from the upper east to Jing Province following a fizzled plot to kill Cao and reestablish capacity to the majestic line (; ). 

The underlying phases of the battle were an unfit accomplishment for Cao, as the direction of Jing Province had been considerably debilitated and the Jing armed forces depleted by struggle with Sun Quan toward the south . Groups had emerged supporting both of Liu Biao's two children in a battle for progression. The more youthful child won, and Liu Biao's seized oldest child, Liu Qi, left to accept a commandery in Jiangxia (present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei) . Liu Biao passed on of ailment just half a month later, while Cao was progressing from the north and, under these conditions, Liu Biao's more youthful child and successor, Liu Cong, immediately surrendered. Cao in this manner caught a sizeable armada and verified the maritime base at Jiangling. This gave him a key military station and forward base to harbor his boats . 

When Jing Province fell, Liu Bei immediately fled south, joined by a displaced person populace of regular people and officers. This scattered mass migration was sought after by Cao's world class mounted force, and was encompassed and definitively beaten at the Battle of Changban (close present-day Dangyang, Hubei). Liu Bei got away, be that as it may, and fled further east to Xiakou, where he liaised with Sun Quan's emissary Lu Su. Now verifiable records are conflicting; Lu Su may have effectively urged Liu Bei to move much further east, to Fankou (æ¨å£; around present-day Ezhou, Hubei). In either case, Liu Bei was later joined by Liu Qi and duties from Jiangxia . Liu Bei's primary guide, Zhuge Liang, was sent to Chaisang (æ´æ¡; in present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi) to arrange shaping a common front against Cao with Sun Quan . 

When Zhuge Liang arrived, Cao had effectively sent Sun Quan a letter bragging directing 800,000 men and implying that he needed Sun to surrender. The group driven by Sun Quan's Chief Clerk, Zhang Zhao, supported surrender, refering to Cao's mind-boggling numerical preferred standpoint. In any case, on isolated events, Lu Su, Zhuge Liang, and Sun Quan's central officer, Zhou Yu, all displayed contentions to influence Sun Quan to consent to the union against the northerners. Sun Quan at last settled on war, slashing off a side of his work area amid a gathering and expressing: "Any individual who still sets out contend for surrender will be [treated] equivalent to this work area." He at that point alloted Zhou Yu, Cheng Pu, and Lu Su with 30,000 men to help Liu Bei against Cao . 

In spite of the fact that Cao had bragged order 800,000 men, Zhou Yu assessed Cao's genuine troop solidarity to be more like 230,000. Moreover, this complete included 80,000 awed troops from the armed forces of the as of late perished Liu Biao, so the unwaveringness and resolve of a substantial number of Cao's power was dubious . With the 20,000 troopers that Liu Bei had accumulated, the union comprised of around 50,000 marines who were prepared and arranged for the fight to come . 

The Battle of Red Cliffs unfurled in three phases: an underlying clash at Red Cliffs pursued by a retreat to the Wulin (çæ) front lines on the northwestern bank of the Yangtze, an unequivocal maritime commitment, and Cao's tragic retreat along Huarong Road. 

The consolidated Sun-Liu constrain cruised upstream from either Xiakou or Fankou to Red Cliffs, where they experienced Cao's vanguard compel. Tormented by sickness and low confidence because of the arrangement of constrained walks they had attempted on the delayed southern crusade , Cao's men couldn't pick up favorable position in the little encounter which followed, so Cao withdrew to Wulin (north of the Yangtze River) and the partners destroyed back toward the south . 

Cao had fastened his boats from stem to stern, potentially expecting to diminish nausea in his naval force, which involved for the most part northerners who were not used to living on boats. Watching this, divisional leader Huang Gai sent Cao a letter pretending surrender and arranged a squadron of capital boats portrayed as "mengchong doujian" (èè¡é¬¥è¦). The boats had been changed over into flame delivers by filling them with groups of fuel, dry reeds, and greasy oil. As Huang Gai's "abandoning" squadron moved toward the midpoint of the waterway, the mariners connected flame to the boats before taking to little vessels. The unmanned flame ships, conveyed by the southeastern breeze, sped towards Cao's armada and set it on fire. A substantial number of men and ponies either consumed to death or suffocated . 

Following the underlying stun, Zhou Yu and the partners drove a delicately equipped power to gain by the ambush. The northern armed force was tossed into disarray and was absolutely crushed. Seeing the circumstance was sad, Cao then issued a general request of retreat and devastated some of his outstanding boats before pulling back . 

Cao's military endeavored a retreat along Huarong Road, including an extended length going through marshlands north of Dongting Lake. Substantial downpours had made the street so misleading that a large number of the debilitated warriors needed to convey packs of grass on their backs and use them to fill the way to permit the horsemen to cross. A considerable lot of these officers suffocated in the mud or were trampled to death in the exertion. The partners, driven by Zhou Yu and Liu Bei, gave pursue over land and water until they achieved Nan Commandery (åé¡; present-day Jiangling County, Jingzhou, Hubei); joined with starvation and ailment, this annihilated Cao's outstanding powers. Cao then withdrawn north to his command post of Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei), leaving Cao Ren and Xu Huang to protect Jiangling, Yue Jin positioned in Xiangyang, and Man Chong in Dangyang . 

The unified counterattack may have vanquished Cao and his powers altogether. Be that as it may, the intersection of the Yangtze River broke up into disorder as the united armed forces combined on the riverbank and battled about the predetermined number of ships. To reestablish request, a separation driven by Sun Quan's general Gan Ning set up a bridgehead in Yiling toward the north, and just a staunch rearguard activity by Cao Ren averted further calamity (; ). 

A mix of Cao's vital mistakes and the viability of Huang Gai's ploy had brought about the associated triumph at the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhou Yu had recently seen that Cao's commanders and warriors involved for the most part mounted force and infantry, and few had any involvement in maritime fighting. Cao likewise had little help among the general population of Jing Province, and in this way did not have a safe forward base of tasks . Regardless of the key keenness Cao had shown in before crusades and fights, for this situation he had just expected that numerical prevalence would in the long run thrashing the Sun and Liu naval force. Cao's first strategic slip-up was changing over his monstrous armed force of infantry and mounted force into a marine corps and naval force: with just a couple of long stretches of drills before the fight, Cao's troops were assaulted via ocean ailment and absence of experience on water. Tropical illnesses, to which the southerners were to a great extent safe, were likewise uncontrolled in Cao's camps. Albeit various, Cao's men were at that point depleted by the new condition and the all-encompassing southern crusade, as Zhuge Liang watched: "Even an amazing bolt toward the finish of its flight can't infiltrate a silk fabric" (Military Documents 1979:193). 

A key consultant, Jia Xu, had prescribed after the surrender of Liu Cong that the overburdened armed forces be offered time to rest and renew before drawing in the militaries of Sun Quan and Liu Bei, however Cao dismissed the counsel . Cao's very own musings with respect to his disappointment at Red Cliffs recommend that he considered his own behavior and setbacks in charge of the annihilation, as opposed to the procedures used by his foe amid the fight: "...Â it was simply because of the infection that I consumed my boats and withdrew. It is out of all explanation behind Zhou Yu to assume the acknowledgment for himself." . 

Before the finish of 209, the post Cao had built up at Jiangling tumbled to Zhou Yu. The outskirts of the land under Cao's control contracted about , to the zone around Xiangyang . Liu Bei, then again, had picked up an area by assuming control over the four commanderies (Wuling, Changsha, Lingling and Guiyang) south of the Yangtze River. Sun Quan's troops had endured far more noteworthy setbacks than Liu Bei's in the all-encompassing clash against Cao Ren following the Battle of Red Cliffs , and the passing of Zhou Yu in 210 brought about an exceptional debilitating of Sun Quan's quality in Jing Province . Liu Bei likewise involved Jing Province that Cao had as of late lostâa vital and normally invigorated zone on the Yangtze River that Sun Quan guaranteed for himself. The control of Jing Province furnished Liu Bei with practically boundless access to the entry into Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) and essential conduits into Wu (southeastern China), just as territory of the southern Yangtze River. 

Never again would Cao direction so vast an armada as he had at Jiangling, nor would a comparable chance to crush his southern opponents present itself again . The Battle of Red Cliffs and the catch of Jing Province by Liu Bei affirmed the partition of southern China from the northern heartland of the Yellow River valley, and furthermore foreshadowed a north-south pivot of antagonistic vibe that would resound for a considerable length of time . 

The exact area of the Red Cliffs front line has for some time been the subject of both well known and scholarly discussions, however has never been decisively settled. Academic discussions have proceeded for no less than 1,350 years , and various contentions for elective locales have been advanced. There are clear justification for dismissing probably a portion of these proposition, however four elective areas are still upheld. As per , a large number of the momentum discusses originate from the way that the course and length of the Yangtze River among Wuli and Wuhan has changed since the Sui and Tang lines . The advanced discussion is additionally convoluted by the way that the names of a portion of the key areas have changed over the next hundreds of years. For instance, albeit current Huarong city is situated in Hunan, south of the Yangtze, in the third century the city of that name was expected east of Jiangling, significantly north of the Yangtze (; ). Besides, one competitor site, Puqi (è²å»), was renamed "Chibi City" (èµ¤å£å¸) in 1998 of every an immediate endeavor to attach this area to the verifiable front line. 

Chronicled records express that Cao's powers withdrew north over the Yangtze after the underlying commitment at Red Cliffs, unequivocally setting the fight site on the south bank of the Yangtze. Hence, various locales on the north bank have been limited by students of history and geographers. Verifiable records additionally build up east and west limits for a stretch of the Yangtze which incorporates every single imaginable site for the combat zone. The associated powers voyaged upstream from either Fankou or Xiakou. Since the Yangtze streams generally eastbound towards the sea (with upper east and southeast winds), Red Cliffs should at any rate be west of Fankou, which is more remote downstream. The westernmost limit is additionally clear, since Cao's eastern development from Jiangling included passing Baqiu (present-day Yueyang, Hunan) on the shore of Dongting Lake. The fight should likewise have been downstream (upper east) of that area (; ). 

One well known contender for the fight site is Chibi Hill in Huangzhou, in some cases alluded to as "Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs" or the "Abstract Red Cliffs" (æèµ¤å£). Backing for this guess emerges generally because of the celebrated eleventh century lyric "First Rhapsody on the Red Cliffs", which likens the Huangzhou Hill with the war zone area. Barring tone denotes, the pinyin romanization of this current bluff's name is "Chibi", equivalent to the pinyin for Red Cliffs. In any case, the Chinese characters are totally unique (èµ¤é¼») similar to their significance ("Red Nose Hill"). This site is likewise on the north bank of the Yangtze, and is straightforwardly opposite Fankou instead of upstream from it . In addition, if the unified Sun-Liu powers left from Xiakou as opposed to Fankou, as the most seasoned chronicled sources propose, at that point the slope in Huangzhou would have been "downstream" from the purpose of flight, a probability which can't be accommodated with authentic sources. 

Puqi, presently named Chibi City, is maybe the most generally acknowledged competitor. To separate from Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs, the site is additionally alluded to as the "Military Red Cliffs" (æ­¦èµ¤å£). It is legitimately over the Yangtze from Wulin. This contention was first proposed in the early Tang tradition . There are additionally characters engraved in the bluffs (see picture at the highest point of this page) proposing this is the site of the fight. The starting point of the etching can be dated to between the Tang and Song traditions, making it no less than 1,000 years of age . 

A few sources notice the south banks of the Yangtze in Jiayu County (åé±¼å¿) in the prefecture-level city of Xianning in Hubei area as a conceivable area. This would put the front line downstream from Puqi (Chibi City), a view that is upheld by researchers of Chinese history, for example, Rafe de Crespigny, Wang Li and Zhu Dongrun, following the Qing tradition authentic report "Shui Jing Zhu" . 

Another competitor is Wuhan, which straddles the Yangtze at the juncture of the Yangtze and Han waterways. It is east of both Wulin (and Chibi City over the stream) and Jiayu. This city was fused by joining three urban areas. There is a neighborhood faith in Wuhan that the fight was battled at the intersection of the waterways, southwest of the previous Wuchang city, which is presently part of Wuhan . attests that the Chibi combat zone was one of a lot of slopes in Wuchang that were leveled during the 1930s with the goal that their stone could be utilized as crude material. Refering to a few verifiable geological investigations, demonstrates that prior records place the front line in Wuchang. Sheng Hongzhi's fifth century "Jingzhou ji" specifically puts the Chibi combat zone a separation of 160Â li (roughly ) downstream from Wulin, yet since the Paizhou and Luxikou winds expanded the length of the Yangtze River among Wuli and Wuchang by 100Â li (around ; "see map") some time in the Sui and Tang traditions , later works don't see Wuchang as a conceivable site. 

The sentimental custom that started with the fourteenth century authentic novel "Sentiment of the Three Kingdoms" varies from verifiable records in numerous subtleties. For instance, Cao's military quality was overstated to more than 830,000 men. This might be ascribed to the ethos of later occasions, especially of the Southern Song line . The territory of Shu Han, specifically, was seen by later literati as the "real" successor to the Han administration, so fictionalized records dole out more prominent noticeable quality than the verifiable records warrant to the jobs of Liu Bei, Zhuge Liang and different legends from Shu. This is commonly practiced by limiting the significance of Eastern Wu commandants and consultants, for example, Zhou Yu and Lu Su . While recorded records portray Lu Su as a reasonable counselor and Zhou Yu as a famous military pioneer and "liberal, reasonable and gutsy" man, "Sentiment of the Three Kingdoms" delineates Lu Su as unremarkable and Zhou Yu as brutal and negative . Both are delineated as being second rate compared to Zhuge Liang in each regard . 

The sentiments included entirely anecdotal and fantastical components to the verifiable records and these were rehashed in well known plays and musical dramas. Precedents from the "Sentiment of the Three Kingdoms" incorporate Zhuge Liang claiming to utilize enchantment to call forward good breezes (that he had in actuality anticipated by cosmic perception) for the flame transport assault, his technique of "utilizing straw vessels to obtain bolts", and Guan Yu catching and discharging Cao at Huarong Trail. The fictionalized records additionally name Zhuge Liang as a military leader in the consolidated powers, which is verifiably incorrect . 

Present-day Chibi City in Hubei territory was in the past named Puqi. In 1998, the Chinese State Council endorsed the renaming of the city in festivity of the fight at Red Cliffs. Social celebrations held by the city have significantly expanded the travel industry. (Xinhua 1997). In 1983, a statue of unmistakable Song administration writer, Su Shi, was raised at the Huangzhou site of 'Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs' in tribute to his works with respect to Red Cliff (Xinhua 1983). 

Computer games dependent on the Three Kingdoms period, (for example, Koei's "Administration Warriors" arrangement, "Sangokushi Koumeiden", "Predetermination of an Emperor" and "Kessen II") have situations that incorporate the fight. Different recreations use the Battle of Red Cliffs as their focal core interest. These incorporate titles well known in Asia, for example, the first Japanese adaptation of "Warriors of Fate" and "". 

A 2008 movie titled "Red Cliff", coordinated by John Woo, displayed the Red Cliff inheritance and was an enormous film industry accomplishment in China. 

"Fight at the Red Cliffs" is one of the 10 volumes in a represented interpretation of "Sentiment of the Three Kingdoms" by a Singapore distributing organization, Asiapac Books, in English.
