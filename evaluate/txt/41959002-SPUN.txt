The congregation and graveyard are arranged on a feign toward the west of United States Route 220, at a height of . The property is encompassed by old-development woods. 

The congregation is in a rustic territory of southwestern Hampshire County inside the Mill Creek valley. Patterson Creek Mountain, a forested tight anticlinal mountain edge, ascends toward the west of Mill Creek valley, and the forested western moving lower regions of the anticlinal Mill Creek Mountain ascend to the valley's east. The Trough on the South Branch Potomac River is situated crosswise over Mill Creek Mountain, roughly toward the east of the congregation. 

Old Pine Church's territory tract was initially part of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a land concede that the ousted Charles II granted to seven of his supporters in 1649 amid the English Interregnum. Following the Restoration in 1660, Charles II at last climbed to the English position of authority. Charles II recharged the Northern Neck Proprietary give in 1662, modified it in 1669, and again restored the first allow favoring unique grantee Thomas Colepeper, second Baron Colepeper and Henry Bennet, first Earl of Arlington in 1672. In 1681, Bennet sold his offer to Lord Colepeper, and Lord Colepeper got another sanction for the whole land allow from James II in 1688. Following the passings of Lord Colepeper, his better half Margaret, and his little girl Katherine, the Northern Neck Proprietary go to Katherine's child Thomas Fairfax, sixth Lord Fairfax of Cameron in 1719. 

The congregation is in the Mill Creek valley. As strains with Native Americans were starting to ease, Lord Fairfax looked to tempt white pioneers to the meagerly settled terrains of his Northern Neck Proprietary. The valley was one of the initial segments of present-day Hampshire County to be settled by whites, starting in the mid-eighteenth century. Pilgrims were drawn by the valley's richness. As the valley's populace developed, the unincorporated network of Purgitsville created along Mill Creek as an exchanging post town; it was named for Henry Purgitt (or Purgate), who procured in the Mill Creek valley on January 7, 1785, and got a further land move of in 1794. Purgitsville kept on creating over the span of the nineteenth century, amid which time it developed to incorporate a little store, a mail station, and a metalworker shop. 

The dates of the most punctual church can't be checked, however a congregation building may have been built at the site of Old Pine Church as ahead of schedule as around 1814, and perhaps as right on time as 1792. 

On September 24, 1838, William Pomkrotz and his significant other, Milly, deeded a tract of land to a gathering of trustees, accused of developing "a congregation or house for open love for the utilization and accommodation of Ministers and others of the Christians [sic] Denominations Whatsoever". While the deed referenced a current gathering house on the site, there is no surviving proof of an earlier structure. As per design student of history Sandra Scaffidi, no specific Christian division got sole responsibility for building, which recommends that the congregation was planned to fill in as a nondenominational "association church". The congregation's soonest inhabitant serve was allegedly Nicholas Leatherman, whose spouse, Elizabeth High, was the girl of George High, one of the congregation's unique trustees. 

Barely any records of the congregation's history exist, potentially on the grounds that no single section or association took proprietorship. A few Christian groups held gatherings at Old Pine Church, including the Schwarzenau Brethren (or German Baptist Brethren), which started holding administrations at the congregation in the late nineteenth century. The same number of the Mill Creek valley's pilgrims were of German plunge, the Old Pine Church structure may likewise have been worked as a gathering place for Brethren disciples, known as "Dunkers" or "Dunkards".

As per the minutes from the 1782 gathering of the Brethren in Franklin County, Virginia, "It has been collectively viewed as that it can't be allowed in any capacity by the congregation that a part should buy Negroes or keep them as Slaves." While numerous occupants in Hampshire County preceding the American Civil War were slaveholders, it is felt that Brethren followers in the district did not possess slaves or rely on slave work. 

The Brethren section had been available in the South Branch Potomac River valley from as ahead of schedule as the 1750s despite the fact that records of early Brethren assemblies are not surviving, conceivably on the grounds that they were served by nomad pastors. As ahead of schedule as 1785, two siblings with the surname of Powers drove a Brethren assemblage in the territory. In Dr. Emmert F. Bittinger's verifiable research on the Brethren Church in Hampshire County in his "Allegheny Passage" (1990), it is noticed that the Church of the Brethren division perceived Old Pine Church as having a place with the bigger Beaver Run assemblage, which was focused roughly south of Old Pine Church. The Beaver Run assembly was the primary association of the Brethren in Hampshire County. Old Pine Church and its forerunner structures were most likely used by individuals from the Beaver Run assembly on the grounds that the separation between the northern area of the valley and the congregation on Beaver Run was too extraordinary to even think about traversing effectively. Along these lines, Old Pine Church started as a mission of the Beaver Run gathering. As a result of its area in the region of the Hardy County limit line, the locale served by the congregation spread over the two districts. 

By 1870, Old Pine Church was fundamentally utilized by the Brethren category. Around 1870, the Nicholas assembly of Brethren was revering at the congregation and was driven by Dr.Â Leatherman. As per the Beaver Run Church Book, enrollment at Old Pine Church was 78 out of 1879 and numbered 100 of every 1881. The Beaver Run assembly altered its locale's limits in 1879, which may have brought about a division of the gathering at Old Pine Church into two groups: White Pine Church of the Brethren and Old Pine Church. The two chapels kept on revering at Old Pine Church at various occasions. White Pine Church of the Brethren venerated at the congregation from the 1870s until the development of their own congregation working in 1907. By 1897, Old Pine Church stayed under aggregate proprietorship by a few Christian sections despite the fact that the Brethren were the congregation's biggest investors. White Pine Church of the Brethren stayed recorded in the Brethren Conference Minutes as "Pine Church" until 1912, when individuals from the congregation appealed to the Brethren Conference to change their name from "Pine" to "White Pine". 

Old Pine Church supposedly housed a school in the mid twentieth century while as yet filling in as a middle for love. A little one-room expansion to the congregation was developed toward the north faÃ§ade of the structure, which filled in as the boarding space for the teacher. The Old Pine Church likewise kept on being utilized for memorial service administrations and reunions.

The boarding room option was likely evacuated (nothing of it currently remains) and the squeezed metal roof may have been included.
