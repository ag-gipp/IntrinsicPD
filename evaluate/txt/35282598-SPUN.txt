Roger Norreis 

Roger Norreis (kicked the bucket somewhere in the range of 1223 and 1225) was Abbot of Evesham in England. He was a questionable figure, introduced in a few workplaces against restriction. In his arrangement to Evesham he was blamed for improper conduct and neglecting to pursue devout standards. In 1202 Norreis wound up entangled in a question with his priests and his episcopal predominant the Bishop of Worcester; prosecution and argumentation kept going until his affidavit in 1213. He at that point was designated earlier of a backup ascetic place of Evesham yet was ousted inside months, at that point re-selected to the workplace five years after the fact. 

Norreis has been depicted by current students of history as being unsuited for the religious positions to which he was selected and by one of being totally unsatisfactory to hold any sort of otherworldly job. By and by, even his most extreme contemporary faultfinder, Thomas of Marlborough, one of his own priests at Evesham, surrendered that Norreis was fiery, engaging, and venturesome; amid his time as abbot of Evesham Abbey he figured out how to finish the intersection tower of the religious church. 

Roger Norreis kicked the bucket somewhere in the range of 1223 and 1225. 

Norreis was a local of northern England and his family was most likely of Norse starting point. He was a priest at Christ Church Priory, the house of God section of Canterbury Cathedral; when he turned into a priest is obscure. In 1187 he was named treasurer of the cloister, and in that job was sent by the house of prayer section to King Henry II of England to argue their body of evidence against Baldwin of Forde, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The diocese supervisor and his priests were in disagreement about Baldwin's arrangement to establish a university church at Hackington to pay tribute to Thomas Becket which a large portion of the priests restricted on the grounds that they dreaded it would decrease the renown of their monastery. 

Once Norreis achieved the lord he was changed over to Baldwin's side, maybe due to the last's arrangement of Norreis as the cellarer of Christ Church while the pair were at the ruler's court. The priests opposed this arrangement, and in September they spoke to the papacy, contending that the arrangement was against the Benedictine Rule. They additionally caught and held Norreis in care, telling any individual who enquired after him that he was wiped out. Norreis got away in mid 1188 by going through the sewer and fled to the wellbeing of the diocese supervisor, who was then at Otford. In a ridiculing reference to his break course, Norreis was once in a while known as Roger Cloacarius or "Roger the Drain-Cleaner". Baldwin at that point attempted to have Norreis introduced as earlier at Christ Church's reliant cloister of St Martin's, Dover, yet the arrangement was never affirmed. 

Lord Henry passed on 6 July 1189 and his child Richard I was delegated on 3 September. The progression of another ruler in the end permitted a ceasefire in the debate between the Canterbury priests and their ecclesiastical overseer, as Henry had been a supporter of the diocese supervisor's plan. Before the dÃ©tente could be worked out, Baldwin designated Norreis as earlier of Christ Church in October 1189 as another move in the squabble about the Hackington venture. In November the house of God part verified a trade off that incorporated the relinquishment of the plan and Norreis' rejection from office. The understanding came at a board held by Richard in late November 1189 at which the priests consented to give the lord a chance to settle the argument about the Hackington venture if the diocese supervisor would pull back Norreis' arrangement. Norreis' kindred priests thought of him as a deceiver to their motivation, and his notoriety was that of somebody with couple of ethics. He was additionally known for charming himself with people with great influence, including the justiciar Geoffrey fitzPeter. Huge numbers of the insights about Norreis' profession at Christ Church originate from crafted by Gervase of Canterbury, just as the accumulation of letters known as the "Epistolae Cantuarienses". 

Norreis was delegated to the abbacy of Evesham Abbey in 1190 and was honored as abbot on 13 January 1190. He owed his arrangement to King Richard and to Baldwin's endeavors to make the rejection from Christ Church look less like a thrashing for the ecclesiastical overseer. Norreis likewise asserted that he got the workplace as a byproduct of unspecified administrations he rendered to Richard. There was no endeavor at a decision by the priests, a need which conflicted with ordinance law. Amid his residency of office, his priests blamed him for sex, inordinate drinking, intemperance, setting up top choices, starving the priests, and appropriating religious property for his very own utilization. A further offense was his propensity for wearing mainstream garments as opposed to the ascetic propensity recommended by the Benedictine Rule. Every one of these charges originate from one of his priests, the student of history Thomas of Marlborough, who composed a great part of the historical backdrop of Evesham known as the "Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham". Thomas' record of Norreis' standard is one-sided against the abbot and is a self-aggrandising record of how Thomas without any assistance triumphed over the two his and his nunnery's adversaries. Norreis benefited oversee for the nunnery, as it was while he was abbot that the intersection tower of the ascetic church was finished. 

Right off the bat in his residency Norreis seems to have been to some degree attentive and did not enormously disturb his priests. The change seems to have occurred around 1195, when the priests are first recorded as engaging more recognizable specialist. Since Evesham had generally professed to be excluded from episcopal oversight by the see of Worcester, in which it was found, the priests could just speak to the papacy or to an ecclesiastical legate. Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury after Baldwin, held a legateship for England until July 1195 thus the priests engaged him. Walter constrained Norreis to make a few trade offs with his subordinates, however the dÃ©tente did not keep going long, and the priests indeed grumbled of their treatment. They were visited by the new Bishop of Worcester John of Coutances some time somewhere in the range of 1196 and 1198, yet Norreis prevailing with regards to keeping away from any serious endorses by offering blessings to the religious administrator. The priests again spoke to Walter in around 1200, however between the diocese supervisor's distraction with political undertakings and Norreis' guarantees to change, no strong changes happened. 

In 1202 the new Bishop of Worcester Mauger endeavored to examine Norreis' direct, however under the authority of Thomas of Marlborough the devout network would not enable the minister to visit, guaranteeing that Evesham was excluded from episcopal appearance and oversight. As indicated by Thomas, Norreis offered to deny the monastery's case to exception as an end-result of cash, yet the minister cannot. Norreis then fled the cloister, while the priests kept on denying the cleric and were expelled, a sentence that Norreis was saved. Between early September and mid-October the question was heard by three ministerial councils; Mauger was upheld by Eustace, Bishop of Ely, and Giles de Braose, Bishop of Hereford. The priests and Norreis then made normal reason, each vowing to remain by the other in opposing Mauger. Just as these two cases, there was a question between the priests and the priest over the responsibility for properties. The priests and Norreis then got the privilege for their case to be heard by ecclesiastical judge-delegates, however Mauger protested the way that the named judges were all Benedictine priests, and made a trip to Rome to offer. 

In 1203 Norreis, secure in his collusion with his very own priests, by and by started to misuse the religious community for his very own benefit and that of his family and companions. His priests wound up irritated with this recharging of their misuse and sent Thomas, alongside different priests, to proper the collect from certain terrains that had been given by Norreis to a non-individual from the network. Norreis dissented to King John and to Hubert Walter. Both the ruler and Walter gathered Thomas to show up before them independently and clarify the activities of the priests. Thomas neglected to induce either man and nothing was done about Norreis' exactions and maltreatment of his priests. 

Norreis went to Rome in the organization of Thomas of Marlborough in no time before 1205 to lay the convent's case before the papacy. Thomas stayed in Italy, however Norreis came back to England amidst 1205. While in Rome, Norreis and Thomas obtained 400 imprints to fund the prosecution at the ecclesiastical curia. Norreis couldn't compensate this aggregate and for some time was in peril of being detained, yet he figured out how to leave Rome without enduring the destiny of one of his allies who was kept for the obligation and passed on while detained. At the point when Norreis made it back to England, Mauger suspended the abbot in April 1205. The priests won a triumph on the subject of the nunnery's exclusion from episcopal appearance in 1206, yet different components of the squabble stayed uncertain, including that of the questioned houses of worship. Soon thereafter the priests turned out to be so irritated by Norreis' maltreatment that they relinquished the nunnery and did not return until they verified the abbot's affirmation of their rights. 

With the topic of the episcopal exception chose to support Evesham, the collusion among Norreis and his priests disintegrated. The priests again griped of their abbot's conduct to the new ecclesiastical legate, John of Sancta Maria. The legate requested an examination, the outcome being a composed understanding between the two gatherings. Norreis offered blessings to the legate's nephew, would not consent to the arrangement, and delivered retribution on his rivals by removing Thomas of Marlborough and his partners from the religious community. Thirty priests pursued Thomas into outcast, and Norreis sought after them with troopers who were crushed by the priests. A trade off was in the end come to, Norreis concurring that the incomes of the nunnery would be part with the priests, that authorities of the monastery would be selected by the abbot however with the exhortation and assent of the priests, and that the abbot would not concede or oust priests without taking the guidance of his priests nor discard the ascetic property without the assent of his subordinates. Despite the fact that the issue of the priests' help was incidentally explained, the issue of the debated properties among Mauger and the cloister proceeded. Norreis seems to have been happy to bargain with the religious administrator, however the priests can't. 

The question among Norreis and his priests delayed for a considerable length of time. The prohibit of 1207â 1213 brought on additional postponements, yet when it was lifted in 1213 the body of evidence against Norreis was at long last heard. An ecclesiastical legate visited the convent and found that the priests were inadequate in sustenance, garments, and different necessities. The ceremony was not being performed by the devout principle in light of the fact that the priests came up short on the best possible apparel. Philanthropy to the poor had stopped, the ascetic structures were decrepit, and the priests were compelled to ask for their requirements. The legate found that the abbot was living great, wearing non-devout garments, and getting a charge out of the organization of young ladies in his home, while his priests endured. Norreis was dismissed from the abbacy by the ecclesiastical legate in 1213. 

On 27 November 1213 Norreis was designated the earlier of Penwortham Priory, a reliant convent of Evesham, incompletely to remunerate him for the loss of the abbacy and mostly to shield him from relinquishing ascetic life completely. Norreis was dismissed five months after the fact attributable to his proceeded with terrible ethics and conduct and again went to Rome in an offer to be reestablished to office. On this event he was unfit to verify his reestablishment, yet in 1218 or 1219 he was reestablished to Penwortham through the impact of the ecclesiastical legate Pandulf Verraccio. Norreis kicked the bucket on 16 July or 19 July, however there is contradiction throughout the time of his passing. The "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" expresses that he passed on in 1223, yet the editors of "Heads of Religious Houses: England and Wales, 940â 1216" state he kicked the bucket in either 1224 or 1225. He was covered at Penwortham. 

Thomas of Marlborough, who knew Norreis, composed that he was "wherever denounced as the show adversary of God". Increasingly current scholars reverberation the notion. John Moorman portrayed Norreis as a man "absolutely unsuited to the fragile and capable assignment of decision over an organization of men and coordinating the issues of a well off company". David Knowles, a student of history of English asceticism, composed that Norreis was "totally shameful to hold profound office of any sort", and that Baldwin's arrangement of him as earlier at Christ Church "should dependably remain a dim stain on the ecclesiastical overseer's notoriety". Knowles additionally noticed that he was "a man of incredible down to earth capacity". Indeed, even Thomas of Marlborough noticed that Norreis was fiery, engaging, and loaded with big business.
