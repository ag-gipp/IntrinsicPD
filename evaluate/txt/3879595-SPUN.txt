No. 33 Squadron RAAF 

No. 33 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) vital transport and aerial refueling squadron. It works Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports from RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. The squadron was framed in February 1942 for administration amid World WarÂ II, working Short Empire flying water crafts and an assortment of littler air ship. By 1944 it had totally re-furnished with Douglas C-47 Dakota transports, which it flew in New Guinea preceding disbanding in May 1946. 

The unit was restored in February 1981 as a flight, furnished with two BoeingÂ 707s for VIP and other long-run transport obligations out of RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales. No.Â 33 Flight was re-framed as a full squadron in July 1983. By 1988 it was working six 707s, four of which were in this manner changed over for elevated refueling. The 707s saw dynamic administration amid activities in Namibia, Somalia, the Persian Gulf, and Afghanistan. One of the vehicle planes was lost in an accident in October 1991. No.Â 33 Squadron moved to Amberley and was incidentally without flying machine following the retirement of the 707s in June 2008. It started re-furnishing with KC-30As in June 2011, and accomplished beginning working capacity with the sort in February 2013. One of its flying machine was conveyed to the Middle East in September 2014, as a component of Australia's commitment to the military alliance against ISIS. 

No. 33 Squadron is in charge of aeronautical refueling and long-extend transport. It is situated at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, and constrained by No.Â 86 Wing, which is a piece of Air Mobility Group. The unit central command contains official, regulatory and operational segments. Just as aircrew, the squadron is staffed by upkeep work force in charge of ordinary air ship administration. Heavier support is directed by Northrop Grumman Integrated Defense Services (some time ago Qantas Defense Services). 

The squadron works five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports, the first entered administration in June 2011. Two more are expected for conveyance in 2018. The airplane are run by pilots, refueling administrators and airline stewards. Aerial refueling is viewed as a power multiplier, allowing the RAAF to expand the range and dally time of its flying machine. The capacity to refuel in flight additionally empowers air ship to take off with more weapons than they may something else. 

The KC-30 can convey as much as 100 tons of fuel. Its double conveyance frameworksâtest and-drogue in the wings and blast under the tailâare intended to refuel the RAAF's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet multi-job contenders, Boeing C-17 GlobemasterÂ III substantial airlifters, Boeing E-7 Wedgetail early cautioning flying machine, or other KC-30s. The tanker is likewise fit for refueling future acquisitions including the Lockheed Martin F-35A LightningÂ II stealth warrior, the Boeing EA-18G Growler electronic fighting airplane, and the Boeing P-8A Poseidon sea watch flying machine. In its vehicle design, the KC-30 can convey 270 travelers or 40 tons of load. Just as its flying machine, No.Â 33 Squadron works a test system at Amberley. 

Amid February and March 1942, the RAAF framed four transport units: Nos.Â 33, 34, 35 and 36Â Squadrons. No.Â 33 Squadron was set up on 16Â February at Townsville, Queensland, under the control of North-Eastern Area Command. It was outfitted with four ex-Qantas Short Empire flying water crafts exchanged from No.Â 11 Squadron, alongside a few littler sorts including de Havilland Dragons and Tiger Moths, Avro Ansons, and Vultee Vigilants. The squadron endured its first misfortune on 27Â February, when one of the Empires slammed on arriving at Townsville; the six group individuals were executed. A second Empire was annihilated at its mooring amid a Japanese air assault on Broome, Western Australia, on 3Â March; another Empire was inspired from Qantas to supplant the lost air ship. After two months the boss, Squadron Leader Charles Gurney, was killed in an accident. One of the squadron's assignments was inquiry and-salvage; it lost another Empire on 8Â August 1942, when it sank in overwhelming oceans off the shore of New Guinea while endeavoring to save overcomers of a torpedoed ship. 

No.Â 33 Squadron exchanged to Port Moresby in January 1943, giving air transport to Australian powers associated with the New Guinea battle. Transport needs were so urgent in New Guinea that even the Tiger Moths were utilized, conveying an aggregate of per trip. In Septemberâ October 1943, the squadron started taking conveyance of fifteen Douglas C-47 Dakotas to supplant its arrangement of air ship. When it exchanged to Milne Bay on 1Â January 1944, it was working Dakotas solely, and kept on doing as such for the remainder of the war. The squadron moved to Lae on 15Â January 1945. Following the finish of threats in August 1945, it was entrusted with repatriating administration work force and previous detainees of war. No.Â 33 Squadron came back to Townsville on 11Â March 1946, and disbanded there on 13Â May. 

In 1978, the Australian government chose to buy two traveler planes for vital transport, basically to relieve what it saw as the danger of fear monger assault intrinsic in conveying VIPs on business flights. Its endeavors to get one Boeing 727 each from household transporters Ansett and TAA were fruitless be that as it may, in December, Qantas consented to sell the administration two Boeing 707s for $14.5 million. Buying enormous planes for VIPs was questionable, yet the 707s were additionally proposed for general long-go transport, being equipped for conveying payload or up to 160 travelers. The first was exchanged to the RAAF in March 1979, and its debut Air Force flight occurred on 22Â April. Situated at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, the 707s were at first worked by No.Â 37 Squadron. They were framed into No.Â 33 Flight under the direction of Wing Commander J.D. Grierson on 2Â February 1981. The flight's first mission occurred that day, when it carried RAAF individuals and their families to RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia, an errand that had recently required a Qantas sanction. 

On 1Â July 1983, after the legislature secured two increasingly 707s for $7.5 million from Worldways Canada, No.Â 33 Flight was revamped as No.Â 33 Squadron under Grierson's order. In charge of transporting VIPs, for example, individuals from the British Royal Family, the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, and the Pope, the 707 likewise turned into the first RAAF flying machine to arrive in the Soviet Union, the event being the burial service of Konstantin Chernenko in 1985. Alongside Nos.Â 36 and 37 Squadrons, working Lockheed C-130 Hercules, No.Â 33 Squadron went under the control of No.Â 86 Wing, some portion of the recently settled Air Lift Group (later Air Mobility Group), in February 1987. Routine overhauling of the 707s and Hercules was the obligation of No.Â 486 Squadron, another part of No.Â 86 Wing. Qantas embraced heavier upkeep of the 707s at its stream base in Mascot. The RAAF obtained three increasingly 707s on 25Â February 1988, after a $25 million buy from Boeing Military. One of the airframes was non-flying, for extras just, and was nicknamed "Hulksbury". 

A consortium of Israel Aerospace Industries and Hawker de Havilland changed over four of No.Â 33 Squadron's six workable flying machine to in-flight refueling tankers between December 1988 and May 1992. Their test and-drogue design enabled them to refuel the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornets and the Royal New Zealand Air Force's Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, however not the RAAF's General Dynamics F-111 aircraft, which required a blast framework; the other two 707s kept on being utilized only for long-extend transport. The RAAF had contended for an aerial refueling ability for both the and the , yet the Australian government would not support the last mentioned, considering the F-111's current range adequate for impediment purposes. Onlookers, for example, columnist Frank Cranston guessed that beside any cost issues, the administration was worried that expanding the aircraft's range would flag to the district that Australia was receiving an increasingly forceful resistance act. 

In April 1989, one of the 707s transported 300 Australian Army work force in two flights to Namibia as a feature of the Australian commitment to UNTAG, the United Nations Transition Assistance Group policing the nation's progress to freedom. Soon thereafter, the squadron helped ship individuals from the Australian open when the two local carriers were grounded amid a modern debate; it was also utilized in 1991 after the end of Compass Airlines. On 29Â October 1991, one of the vehicle arranged 707s collided with the ocean amid a preparation trip out of East Sale, Victoria; each of the five group individuals were murdered. The coronial examination into this mishap found that preparation in the hilter kilter dealing with move that caused the accident was insufficient, and that the RAAF did not have an appropriate comprehension of the taking care of qualities of its 707s. The Coroner's first suggestion identified with the requirement for suitable reproduction for this sort of preparing, a zone not legitimately perceived or tended to by the RAAF at the time. No.Â 33 Squadron transported Australian troops to and from Somalia as a major aspect of Operation Solace in 1993. 

In January 1998, still based at Richmond, No.Â 33 Squadron joined Nos.Â 32 and 34 Squadrons under No.Â 84 Wing. Two of No.Â 33 Squadron's air ship were before long utilized to shape No.Â 84 Wing DetachmentÂ A in Kuwait, as a major aspect of Operation Southern Watch. On 5Â March, one of the 707s embraced the principal operational elevated tanker mission since the squadron's re-arrangement in 1983, when it refueled six Panavia Tornados of the Royal Air Force (RAF) over Saudi Arabia. The separation in this manner refueled US F/A-18 Hornets, Northrop Grumman EA-6 Prowlers and McDonnell Douglas AV-8 Harriers, and RAF British Aerospace Harriers, just as the Tornados. From March to September 2002, two 707s framed No.Â 84 Wing Detachment as a major aspect of Australia's commitment to the war in Afghanistan. Situated at Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan, the 707s gave aeronautical refueling to alliance airplane working in the theater, their endeavors acquiring No.Â 84 Wing a Meritorious Unit Citation. 

By the mid-1990s, the maturing 707s conveying Australian VIPs abroad were never again consistent with remote commotion and emanation guidelines. No.Â 33 Squadron surrendered its VIP transport job in 2002, after the passage into administration of No.Â 34 Squadron's Boeing 737 Business Jets and Bombardier Challenger 604s. The squadron was granted the Gloucester Cup in May 2007, "in acknowledgment of its abnormal amounts of capability exhibited throughout the year" regardless of the difficulties of working the out of date 707s, and for having "performed sublimely on various prominent missions". The 707s were resigned in 2008, finishing the 29-year operational history of the sort in the RAAF. The last one in administration, an ex-Qantas fly named "Richmond Town", made a low-level goodbye trip over Sydney on 30Â June in the organization of littler air ship shooting the event, which offered ascend to fear in certain quarters that a 9/11-style psychological oppressor assault was in advancement. Three 707s stayed at Richmond until 2011, when they were flown out by their new administrator, the US-based Omega Air Services; Omega likewise secured the RAAF's Boeing test system, which had been worked by No.Â 285 Squadron. 

Following the retirement of the Boeing 707, No.Â 33 Squadron migrated to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, on 1Â July 2008. It was given a Squadron Standard by Queensland Governor Penelope Wensley on 2Â June 2010, to recognize "25 years of steadfast and remarkable administration". Having been without flying machine for a long time, the squadron started re-outfitting with the first of five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports on 1Â June 2011. The KC-30 could convey one-and-a-half occasions as much fuel as the 707 and was designed with both test and-drogue and blast conveyance frameworks. These air ship had initially been booked to enter administration late in 2008, and the RAAF needed to rent tankers from the United States Air Force and Omega Air to meet its ethereal refueling needs while Airbus corrected issues with the blast framework and finished fundamental specialized documentation. In March 2012, one of the KC-30s set a record for the quantity of travelers carried on a RAAF flying machine, 220 cadets from the Australian Defense Force Academy. 

The squadron got its fifth KC-30 on 3Â December 2012, and accomplished introductory working capacity in February 2013. It expected to achieve last working ability, with both blast and test and-drogue conveyance frameworks, in 2014. On 14Â September that year, the Federal government focused on conveying one of the squadron's KC-30s to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, as a component of an alliance to battle Islamic State powers in Iraq. The air ship was cleared for activities with the test and-drogue framework, as by this stage the blast framework was not prepared. The KC-30 started flying missions in Iraq on 1Â October 2014. The primary effective contact utilizing the blast framework (working together with another RAAF KC-30) occurred close Amberley on 13Â May 2015. In July, the Federal government reported the buy of two more KC-30s, taking No.Â 33 Squadron's armada to seven flying machine; the airframes were to be ex-Qantas A330-200 traveler liners, changed over via Airbus Defense and Space at Getafe, close Madrid. The KC-30 sent to Iraq attempted the main operational utilization of the blast framework in late October 2015, refueling a RAAF E-7 Wedgetail. In March 2016, No.Â 33 Squadron was granted the Duke of Gloucester Cup as the RAAF's most capable squadron of the earlier year, just as the RAAF Maintenance Trophy. The unit's 6th KC-30 was conveyed to Amberley in September 2017; the seventh and last airplane is expected to land in 2019, and will have a VIP traveler conveying capacity expanding its elevated refueling job.
