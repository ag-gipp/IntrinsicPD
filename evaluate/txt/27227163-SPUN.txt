Vanquishing the two adversaries, Kratos voyages to the Temple of Ares, where he experiences the soul of his kid self and discovers that he should come back to the now depressed Atlantis and find the Domain of Death. Prior to leaving, a devoted Spartan furnishes him with his previous weaponsâutilized amid Kratos' days as a Captain of the Spartan armed forceâthe Arms of Sparta. In the wake of coming back to the indented Atlantis, Kratos gets extraordinary hatred from Poseidon for sinking his darling city. 

Entering the Domain of Death, the Spartan liberates his detained sibling. Angered that Kratos had neglected to protect him sooner and expressing he will never excuse him, Deimos assaults and overwhelms Kratos. In any case, Thanatos intercedes and takes a challenging Deimos to Suicide Bluffs (the site of Kratos' suicide endeavor), where Kratos spares Deimos from tumbling to his demise. An appreciative Deimos at that point helps his sibling in fighting the god with the Arms of Sparta.

As Kratos is seen leaving, Athena takes a gander at Kratos and murmurs out of his earshot, "Excuse me... sibling." 

In a post-credits scene, the undertaker places Callisto in a grave by Deimos (with a vacant third grave adjacent) and states "Now... just a single remains." The last scene is an agonizing Kratos sitting on his position of authority on Mount Olympus.
