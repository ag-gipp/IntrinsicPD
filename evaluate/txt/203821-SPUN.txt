Dark necked grebe 

The dark necked grebe ("Podiceps nigricollis"), referred to in North America as the eared grebe, is an individual from the grebe group of water flying creatures. It was depicted in 1831 by Christian Ludwig Brehm. There are presently three acknowledged subspecies, including the assign subspecies. Its reproducing plumage includes a particular ochre-hued plumage that reaches out behind its eye and over its ear coverts. The remainder of the upper parts, including the head, neck, and bosom, are hued dark to blackish darker. The flanks are brownish rufous to maroon-chestnut, and the stomach area is white. At the point when in its non-rearing plumage, this winged animal has grayish-dark upper parts, including the highest point of the head and a vertical stripe on the back of the neck. The flanks are likewise grayish-dark. The remainder of the body is a white or whitish shading. The adolescent has increasingly dark colored in its darker zones. The subspecies "californicus" can be recognized from the select by the previous' typically longer bill. The different subspecies, "P. n. gurneyi", can be separated by its greyer head and upper parts and by its littler size. "P. n. gurneyi" can likewise be differentiated by its absence of a non-rearing plumage. This species is available in parts of Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas. 

The dark necked grebe utilizes numerous scrounging strategies. Bugs, which make up most of this present fledgling's eating regimen, are gotten either on the outside of the water or when they are in flight. It sometimes rehearses foliage gathering. This grebe jumps to get shellfish, molluscs, tadpoles, and little frogs and fish. When shedding at saline lakes, this winged creature encourages for the most part on brackish water shrimp. The dark necked grebe makes a coasting container home on an open lake. The home glass is secured with a plate. This home is found both in settlements and without anyone else. Amid the rearing season, which changes relying upon area, this species will lay one (here and there two) grasp of three to four eggs. The quantity of eggs is now and then bigger because of conspecific brood parasitism. Following a 21-day brooding period, the eggs bring forth, and after that the home is abandoned. After around 10 days, the guardians split up the chicks between themselves. After this, the chicks become autonomous in around 10 days, and fledge in around three weeks. 

In spite of the fact that it for the most part stays away from flight, the dark necked grebe goes similarly as amid relocation. What's more, it ends up flightless for two months subsequent to finishing a movement to achieve a region where it can securely shed. Amid this shed, the grebe can twofold in weight. The movements to achieve these regions are risky, here and there with a huge number of grebe passings. Regardless of this, it is named a least concern animal groups by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). All things considered, this is the most various grebe on the planet. There are potential dangers to it, for example, oil slicks, however these are not prone to show a noteworthy hazard to the general populace. 

This species was first depicted via Carl Ludwig Hablitz in 1783 as "Colymbus caspicus", from a feathered creature in Bandar-e Anzali. This was initially thought to be an equivalent word for the horned grebe, until Erwin Stresemann found that the portrayal connected more to the dark necked grebe in 1948. Prior to this, the most punctual depiction was believed to be by Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1831, who gave this flying creature its current logical name of "Podiceps nigricollis" from a German fledgling. To determine this, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature stifled the name "C. caspicus". The variety name "Dytes" is at times utilized for this species, a situation which was formalized by Robert Ridgway in 1881. 

This flying creature is firmly identified with the shimmering grebe and the Junin grebe. The terminated Colombian grebe is some of the time viewed as a subspecies of this animal varieties, notwithstanding three other surviving subspecies: 

The nonexclusive name, "Podiceps", originates from two Latin words: "podicis", signifying "vent" or "rear-end" and "pes" signifying "foot". This is a reference to the connection purpose of the winged creature's legsâat the extraordinary back end of its body. The particular designation "nigricollis" is Latin for "dark necked": "niger" signifies "dark" and "collis" signifies "neck". The subspecies designation "californicus" originates from "California", while "gurneyi" originates from the name of British ornithologist John Henry Gurney Sr. 

"Dark necked grebe" has been assigned the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). Both basic names for this species allude to highlights noticeable when the winged creature is in its reproducing plumage; in such plumage, it has an all-dark neck and a splash of brilliant crest on each side of its head. The name "eared grebe" is almost a century more seasoned than the name "dark necked grebe". The last was first utilized in 1912 by Ernst Hartert, with an end goal to align the basic name of the species with its logical name. The name "eared grebe" is as yet utilized in North America to allude to this flying creature. 

The dark necked grebe ordinarily measures between long and weighs . The select subspecies in rearing plumage has the head, neck, bosom, and upper parts hued dark to blackish darker, except for the ochre-shaded enthusiast of quills stretching out behind the eye over the eye-coverts and sides of the scruff. This eye is generally red, with a tight and paler yellow ring on the internal pieces of the eye and an orange-yellow to pinkish-red . The meager, upturned bill, then again, is dark, and is associated with the eye by a blackish line beginning at the . Once in a while, the foreneck can be observed to be for the most part tinged darker. The is blackish to dull darker in shading and has a white fix shaped by the secondaries and part of the inward primaries. The flanks are shaded brownish rufous to maroon-chestnut and have the incidental blackish speck. The and stomach area is white, with a special case to the previous being the dim tertials and the generally pale dark brown external primaries. The legs are a dim greenish dim. The genders are comparable. 

In non-reproducing plumage, the designate has grayish-dark upper parts, top, scruff, and hindneck, with the shading on the upper segment of the last being contained in a vertical stripe. The dim shade of the top reaches beneath the eye and can be seen, diffused, to the ear-coverts. Behind the ear-coverts on the sides of the neck, there are white ovals. The remainder of the neck is dim to caramel dark in shading and has white that fluctuates in sum. The bosom is white, and the mid-region is whitish. The flanks are hued in a blend of blackish-dim with white bits. The shade of the bill when not rearing contrasts from that of the reproducing plumage, with the previous being essentially increasingly dark. 

The adolescent dark necked grebe is like the non-reproducing grown-up. There are contrasts, in any case, including the way that the dull zones are typically increasingly earthy in the adolescent, with less dark. The are regularly tinged pale dim, with whitish stamps behind the eye. On the sides of the head and upper neck, there is a buffy or brownish tinge. The chick is wool and has a blackish-dim head with stripes and spots that are white or pale buff-dim. The throat and foreneck are to a great extent pale. The upper parts are generally dim in shading, and the stomach area is white. 

The subspecies "californicus" for the most part has a more drawn out bill contrasted with the designate, and has darker dim internal primaries amid the reproducing season. At the point when not rearing, the designate has diffuse and pale legends less regularly than "Podiceps nigricollis californicus". The different subspecies, "P. n. gurneyi", is the littlest of the three subspecies, notwithstanding having a greyer head and upper parts. The grown-up of this subspecies likewise has a rufous-dark colored tinge on its lesser wing-coverts. It additionally does not have a non-reproducing plumage, notwithstanding the tufts in favor of its head being paler. 

When rearing, the dark necked grebe gives a calm "ooeek" that rises in pitch from an officially high pitch. This call is likewise utilized as a regional call, notwithstanding a low and quick trill, which itself is additionally utilized amid romance. Another call is a short "puuii" or "mind". This grebe is quiet when it isn't the reproducing season and when it is sustaining or resting. 

This species breeds in vegetated regions of freshwater lakes crosswise over Europe, Asia, Africa, northern South America and the southwest and western United States. In the wake of reproducing, this fledgling moves to saline lakes to shed. At that point, in the wake of finishing the shed and sitting tight for once in a while a while, it moves to winter in spots, for example, the south-western Palearctic and the eastern pieces of both Africa and Asia. It additionally winters in southern Africa, somewhere else where it breeds. In the Americas, it winters as far south as Guatemala, in spite of the fact that the wintering populace there is mostly confined to islands in the Gulf of California, the Salton Sea, and Baja California. At the point when not rearing, its territory is basically saline lakes and beach front estuaries. 

This grebe is very gregarious, normally shaping vast provinces when rearing and extensive groups when not. 

This species assembles its coasting home in the normally shallow water of open lakes. The home itself is moored to the lake by plants. It is worked by both the male and female and made out of plant matter. Its majority is submerged, with the base of the shallow glass more often than not being level with the water. Over the glass, there is a level circle. This grebe homes both in provinces and independent from anyone else. When it doesn't settle without anyone else's input, it will regularly settle in blended species states that are comprised of flying creatures, for example, dark headed gulls, ducks, and different waterbirds. The space between the homes in these settlements is regularly . Regardless of whether it settles in provinces or not affects the components of the home. At the point when the feathered creature isn't in a province, the home has a normal distance across of , despite the fact that this can fluctuate, with homes extending from going to over . This is contrasted with homes in states, which have a normal distance across of about . It is proposed that once in a while a few sets of this grebe will steward over various homes when in states. 

Pair development operating at a profit necked grebe more often than not begins amid stops in the movement to the rearing grounds, in spite of the fact that it every so often happens previously, in wintering sets. This pair development proceeds after this grebe has touched base to its rearing grounds. Romance happens when it lands at the rearing lake. The showcases are performed amidst the lake. There is no region engaged with pursuing; people utilized the entire territory of the lake. When promoting for a mate, a dark necked grebe will approach other dark necked grebes with its body cushioned out and its neck erect. It shuts its snout to play out a call, "crap eee-chk", with the last note just scarcely capable of being heard. Romance for the most part stops toward the beginning of settling. 

In the Northern Hemisphere, this winged animal breeds from April to August. In east Africa, the rearing season is in any event from January to February, while in southern Africa, the reproducing season is from October to April. 

The dark necked grebe is socially monogamous. Conspecific or intraspecific brood parasitism, where the female lays eggs in the home of others of their own species is basic with almost 40% of homes being parasitized by and large. As far as region, this grebe will just guard its home site. 

This grebe lays a grasp, and here and there two grips, of three to four powdery greenish or pale blue eggs. Homes that have been parasitized, in any case, will have two additional eggs by and large, despite the fact that the sum that the host lays is about the equivalent regardless of on the off chance that it has been parasitized or not. The eggs, despite the fact that they are at first flawless, do get recolored by the plant matter that the home is worked out of. The eggs measure by and large and are brooded by the two guardians for around 21 days. The laying date of the eggs is to some degree synchronized, with winged creatures in little states having the laying dates spread out by only a couple of days, contrasted with substantial provinces, where the laying date is spread out over 10 days. 

After the chicks bring forth, the winged animals will forsake their home. Despite the fact that the youthful can swim and jump amid this time, they once in a while do, rather remaining on the guardians' backs for four days subsequent to incubating. This conduct is available in all grebes, and is probably going to have advanced in light of the fact that it lessens travel costs, explicitly those back to the home to brood the chicks and give them nourishment. After around 10 days, the guardians split the chicks up, with each parent dealing with about portion of the brood. After this split, the chicks are autonomous in around 10 days, and fledge in around three weeks. 

Whenever exasperates while hatching, this flying creature normally (just shy of half of the time) mostly covers its eggs with home material when the disturbance isn't abrupt, yet a winged creature with a fragmented grip more often than not does not endeavor to cover the eggs. At the point when the disturbance is abrupt, then again, the dark necked grebe typically (just shy of half of the time) does not cover its eggs. In correlation, different types of grebes conceal their eggs when leaving the home. Predation is generally not the essential driver of egg misfortune, with most settling disappointments happening after the chicks have incubated. A noteworthy reason for this is the chilling of the youthful. 

The dark necked grebe scrounges chiefly by jumping from the water, with plunges typically enduring under 30 seconds. These plunges are generally shorter in time when in increasingly shallow water. In the middle of plunges, this grebe rests for a normal of 15 seconds. When benefiting from brackish water shrimp at hypersaline lakes, it likely uses its expansive tongue to obstruct the oral cavity. It is guessed that it at that point squashes prey against its sense of taste to evacuate abundance water. It likewise scrounges by gathering foliage, culling objects off of the outside of water, having its head submerged while swimming, and once in a while catching flying bugs. 

This grebe eats for the most part bugs, of both grown-up and larval stages, just as scavangers, molluscs, tadpoles, and little frogs and fish. When shedding at lakes with high saltiness, in spite of the fact that, this feathered creature sustains generally on brackish water shrimp. The conduct of dark necked grebes changes because of the accessibility of saline solution shrimp; waterways with more shrimp have more grebes, and grebes invest more energy scrounging when the measure of shrimp and the water temperature diminishes. 

The youthful are nourished each one in turn by the guardians, with one feathered creature conveying the youthful while different feeds it. The youthful take nourishment by snatching it, with their mouths, from their folks, or by getting sustenance dropped into the water. At the point when a youthful winged creature can't snatch the sustenance, at that point the grown-ups submerge their bill into the water and shake their bill to separate the nourishment. 

When rearing is finished, the dark necked grebe normally shares in a shed movement to saline lakes. It particularly favors lakes with expansive quantities of invertebrate prey, so it can fill out while shedding and before going on its winter movement. A few feathered creatures, in spite of the fact that, shed when on the reproducing grounds, yet most don't shed until the finish of the shed relocation. This relocation is risky, with hundreds and at times a large number of winged animals being killed by snowstorms when heading out to spots, for example, Mono Lake. 

When it completes its shed movement, this fledgling sheds its remiges among August and September, which makes it unfit to fly. This shed is gone before by an expansion in weight. Amid the shed, the bosom muscles decay. At the point when the shed is finished, this grebe keeps on putting on weight, frequently dramatically increasing its unique weight. This extra fat is utilized to control the dark necked grebe's medium-term fall relocation to its wintering grounds. The fat is most gathered in the midriff, second most in the thorax, and least in the chest. This feathered creature more often than not begins its movement prior when shrimp is increasingly bounteous and when the shedding lake is at a higher than normal temperature. It for the most part leaves on a crisp evening with lower than normal surface temperatures. 

This grebe is a standout amongst the most wasteful fliers among flying creatures. For the most part, it abstains from flying no matter what and holds long-separate flight only for relocation. This is joined with the way that this winged creature is flightless for two months of the year amid its shed. In any case, while moving, it ventures out as much as to achieve rich bolstering zones that are abused by couple of different species. In flight, the state of this grebe resembles a nut case: straight neck, legs trailing, and wings beating regularly. 

When plunging, this fowl pulls its head back and after that curves it forward into the water, with the body following and a slight springing. The legs possibly begin moving when they are submerged. When swimming on the outside of the water, the body of this grebe is moderately high, albeit none of the underparts are seen. The neck is held straight up in a casual way, with the bill being held forward and parallel to the water. Every one of the feet perform solid rotating strokes. 

Vast scaled passings, (for example, 150,000 flying creatures on the Salton Sea in 1992) from erysipelas, avian cholera, avian botulism, and West Nile infection have been recorded previously. In 2013 at the Great Salt Lake, for instance, there was an episode of West Nile infection that could be the biggest recorded in winged creatures in the US. The reason for the flare-up and methods of transmission are obscure, however there has been hypothesis about the last mentioned. Since West Nile infection can make due in brackish water shrimp and, for an impermanent time, the water of the Great Salt Lake around the temperature it was the point at which the cease to exist occurred. Along these lines, all things considered, grebes could wind up tainted by eating infected shrimp or being in defiled water. It is additionally hypothesized that West Nile infection could be transmitted among grebes through contact with the waste of a contaminated grebe. Avian cholera, another malady that can cause substantial scale kick the bucket offs in this grebe, can be expedited by obscure biotoxins, pathogens, and issues with quill waterproofing. 

Starting at 2016, the dark necked grebe is named least worry by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The pattern of the populace is questionable, as certain populaces are diminishing, though others are steady, have a dubious pattern, or are expanding. The support for the present arrangement of this species is its extremely expansive populace (assessed around 3.9â 4.2 million people) joined with a vast evaluated degree of event (around 155 million km (60 million sq mi)). This grebe is likely the most various grebe on the planet. 

Obscure biotoxins, pathogens, and the impedance of quill waterproofing can prompt hypothermia and avian cholera. Since this grebe as a rule winters on the coast, it is additionally powerless against oil contamination. Substantial scale malady, for example, avian cholera, could undermine the species. These and different elements, for example, human unsettling influence, incorporating impacts with power transmission lines, add to declining populaces in specific regions. This species used to be compromised in North America by the millinery business, which encouraged the chasing of the winged animals, and egg gatherers. In spite of the fact that this is valid, this grebe is chased in the Gilan Province in Iran, for both business and recreational purposes. In any case, there is no proof recommending that these dangers could result in a noteworthy hazard for the general populace.
