He was brought up on Saint Croix, one of the fundamental islands forming the U.S. Virgin Islands. In school, Duncan was a splendid student and longed for turning into an Olympic-level swimmer like his sister Tricia. His folks were exceptionally strong and Duncan exceeded expectations at swimming, turning into an adolescent champion in the 50, 100 and 400Â meters free-form and intending to make the 1992 Olympic Games as an individual from the United States Team. 

At the point when Hurricane Hugo decimated the island's solitary Olympic-sized pool in 1989, Duncan was compelled to swim in the sea and he rapidly lost his eagerness for swimming due to his dread of sharks. Duncan was managed another passionate blow when his mom was determined to have bosom malignant growth and kicked the bucket one day before his fourteenth birthday celebration. In her last days, she made Duncan and his sisters guarantee to complete school with a degree, which would later disclose Duncan's refusal to leave school early. Duncan never swam intensely again, yet was roused by his brother by marriage to swing to ball. 

Duncan at first experienced issues adjusting to the diversion he thought would help soothe his torment and dissatisfaction. Nancy Pomroy, the athletic chief of the St. Long distance Country Day School was cited: "[Duncan] was so tremendous. So enormous and tall, however he was dreadfully unbalanced at the time." He defeated this to turn into a champion for the St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School, averaging 25 for every diversion as a senior. His play pulled in the consideration of a few colleges, regardless of having just grabbed the diversion in ninth grade. Wake Forest University b-ball mentor Dave Odom specifically became inspired by Duncan after the 16-year-old supposedly played NBA star Alonzo Mourning to an attract a 5-on-5 impromptu game. Odom was hunting down a tall, physical player to play close to the bin. Given the powerless dimension of ball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was watchful about Duncan at first, particularly after first gathering him and believing him to be oblivious; Duncan gazed vacantly at Odom for a large portion of the discussion. Nonetheless, after the principal talk, Odom comprehended this was only Duncan's method for focusing, and found that he was physically gifted, yet additionally a snappy student. Inevitably, in spite of grant offers by the University of Hartford, the University of Delaware and Providence College, Duncan joined Odom's Wake Forest Demon Deacons. 

In the year prior to Duncan's landing in Wake Forest University, the Demon Deacons achieved the Sweet 16, yet then lost principle scorer Rodney Rogers, who entered the 1993 NBA draft. In the 1993â 94 NCAA season, Coach Dave Odom was thinking about redshirting Duncan, however was compelled to play him after individual first year recruit huge man Makhtar N'Diaye was precluded due to NCAA rules infringement and in the end exchanged to Michigan. Duncan battled with early change issues and was even held scoreless in his first school diversion, however as the year advanced, he and partner Randolph Childress drove the Deacons to a 20â 11 win-misfortune record. Duncan's style of play was straightforward however viable, consolidating a variety of low-post moves, mid-run bank shots and intense safeguard. He was picked to speak to the U.S. in the 1994 Goodwill Games. In the mean time, Duncan progressed in the direction of a degree in brain science and furthermore took classes in human sciences and Chinese writing. Regardless of concentrating vigorously on b-ball, Wake Forest brain research office executive Deborah Best was cited: "Tim [...] was one of my increasingly intelligent understudies. [...] Other than his tallness, I couldn't let him know from some other understudy at Wake Forest." Duncan additionally settled his notoriety for being an apathetic player, to the degree that contradicting fans insulted him as "Mr. Spock", the prototypical legitimate, disengaged character from "Star Trek". 

In the 1994â 95 NCAA season, the sophomore was before long called a standout amongst the best qualified NBA prospects, alongside his companions Joe Smith, Rasheed Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse. Los Angeles Lakers general chief Jerry West proposed that Duncan may turn into the top pick in the 1995 NBA draft on the off chance that he went early, yet Duncan guaranteed everybody he had no aim of going master until he graduated, despite the fact that the NBA was intending to include a tenderfoot compensation top in 1996. He was surrendering a great deal of cash, yet was resolved to remain in school. In that season, he drove the Demon Deacons into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) title amusement against a Rasheed Wallace-drove North Carolina Tar Heels. Amid that amusement, Duncan killed the danger of Wallace, while Childress fixed the success with a bounce shot with four seconds left in extra time. In the NCAA Tournament, the Demon Deacons achieved the Sweet 16, and playing against Oklahoma State, Duncan scored 12 to run with 22 bounce back and eight squares, outflanking Bryant Reeves, however his group lost 71â 66.

In the accompanying 1995â 96 NCAA season, Wake Forest needed to manage the loss of Childress, who graduated the past season and entered the NBA. This gave a chance to Duncan to demonstrate his administration characteristics, and his unpracticed group lost just four recreations in the whole ACC season. The Demon Deacons won the ACC Finals once more, however in the Sweet 16, Duncan contracted seasonal influenza, and his group missed the Final Four by one win. He finished another striking season with midpoints of 19.1 focuses and 12.3 bounce back per amusement, and was again casted a ballot ACC Defensive Player of the Year and won his first ACC Player of the Year grant. At the season's end the Wake Forest star was supposed to enter the 1996 NBA draft, yet at last, he remained in school. 

In the 1996â 97 NCAA season, Duncan was helped by the expansion of future NBA player Loren Woods, a 7'1" player who facilitated the weight on Duncan near the bin. The Demon Deacons won their initial 13 diversions, yet then got into a droop and neglected to win a third ACC title. The NCAA battle was similarly as disappointing, as Stanford University, driven by future NBA point protect Brevin Knight, disposed of Duncan's group with a 72â 66 win. Duncan completed with a separately noteworthy season however, averaging 20.8 focuses, 14.7 bounce back and 3.2 helps per diversion while shooting .606 from the field and winning the Defensive Player of the Year for a third straight season. He earned first-group All-America praises for the second time, and was a consistent pick for both USBWA and Naismith College Player of the Year.

As opposed to contemporary prep-to-expert players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O'Neal, Tracy McGrady or Kobe Bryant, Duncan remained at school for an entire four years. Amid that period, he was a two-time ACC Player of the Year, and a three-time NABC Defensive Player of the Year. The middle additionally made the All-ACC Tournament somewhere in the range of 1995 and 1997, the All-ACC First Team somewhere in the range of 1995 and 1997, and was named Most Valuable Player of the 1996 ACC Tournament.

He left school as the record-breaking driving shot-blocker in ACC history with 481 squaresâat the time second in NCAA archives behind Colgate's Adonal Foyle and third on the ACC profession bouncing back rundown with 1,570 bounce back. In the wake of gaining his professional education, Duncan turned out to be naturally qualified for the 1997 NBA draft. 

In the 1997 NBA draft, the San Antonio Spurs drafted Duncan with the main draft pick. The Spurs were falling off damage perplexed 1996â 97 season; their best player, David Robinsonâhimself a main draft pick in 1987âwas sidelined for the vast majority of the year, and they had completed with a 20â 62 winâ misfortune record. In any case, as the 1997â 98 season drew closer, the Spurs were viewed as a remarkable risk in the NBA. With an accomplished focus in Robinson and the main pick in Duncan, the Spurs included a standout amongst the best frontcourts in the class. Duncan and Robinson wound up known as the "Twin Towers", having earned a notoriety for their extraordinary safeguard near the container, constraining rivals to take lower rate shots from outside. From the earliest starting point, Duncan built up himself as a quality player: in his second street diversion, he snatched 22 bounce back against restricting Chicago Bulls Hall of Fame control forward Dennis Rodman, a numerous bouncing back hero and NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Duncan was casted a ballot to the 1998 NBA All-Star Game by mentors. Afterward, when Duncan played against contradicting Houston Rockets Hall of Fame control forward Charles Barkley, Barkley was so awed he stated: "I have seen the future and he wears number 21." In his youngster season, Duncan satisfied desires for being the main draft pick, beginning in every one of the 82 customary season diversions, averaging 21.1 focuses, 11.9 bounce back, 2.7 helps and 2.5 squares per amusement, and acquiring All-NBA First Team praises. His guarded commitments guaranteed that he was chosen to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team and was likewise named NBA Rookie of the Year, having won the NBA Rookie of the Month grant each and every month that season. Goads mentor Gregg Popovich praised Duncan's psychological strength, expressing his new kid on the block's "mien was independently surprising", Duncan dependably "place things into viewpoint" and never got "excessively playful or excessively discouraged." Center Robinson was similarly awed with Duncan: "He's the genuine article. I'm pleased with his frame of mind and exertion. He gives all the additional exertion and work and needs to improve as a player." 

The Spurs met all requirements for the 1998 NBA Playoffs as the fifth seed, however Duncan had a terrible first half in his first playoff diversion against the Phoenix Suns, causing Suns mentor Danny Ainge to play Duncan with less cautious weight. The new kid on the block exploited this by completing Game 1 with 32 points and 10 bounce back and reproducing the execution in Game 2, adding to a 3â 1 triumph over the Suns. Notwithstanding, the Spurs lost in the second round to the possible Western Conference Champions Utah Jazz. In this arrangement, Duncan was hollowed against Hall-of-Fame control forward Karl Malone. Duncan outscored Malone in the initial two amusements which the Spurs lost, yet as the arrangement advanced, the more experienced Malone shut Duncan down on guard and overwhelmed on offense, outscoring the youthful power forward in Games 3 to 5 18â 10, 34â 22 and 24â 14 individually. 

Amid the lockout-abbreviated 1998â 99 season, the Spurs began with a dull 6â 8 record and Popovich experienced harsh criticism from the press. Be that as it may, Duncan and Robinson remained behind their mentor, and completed the season with a 31â 5 run. The sophomore arrived at the midpoint of 21.7 focuses, 11.4 bounce back, 2.4 helps and 2.5 squares in the ordinary season, making both the All-NBA and All-Defense First Teams. In the 1999 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs vanquished the Minnesota Timberwolves 3â 1, cleared the Los Angeles Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers 4â 0, and crushed the Cinderella story New York Knicks 4â 1 in the Finals. In this arrangement, a substantial unforeseen of Virgin Islanders flew over to help their nearby saint, and were not frustrated. In the initial two diversions, the "Twin Towers" outscored their Knicks partners Chris Dudley/Larry Johnson with 41, 26 bounce back, and nine squares versus five, 12 bounce back, and zero squares. After a Game 3 misfortune in which Duncan was held scoreless in the second from last quarter and submitted three turnovers in the last quarter, Duncan skiped back with 28 and 18 bounce back in a Game 4 win, and in Game 5, the Spurs shielded a 78â 77 lead seconds from the end with the ball in the Knicks' ownership. Twofold joined by Duncan and Robinson, Knicks swingman Latrell Sprewell missed a very late edginess shot, and subsequent to finishing off the arrangement with a solid 31-point and 9-bounce back appearing Game 5, Duncan was named Finals MVP, bringing San Antonio their first-ever NBA title. The honors for the Spurs before long touched base, with "Sports Illustrated" announcing that the San Antonio "monkey has been shed", and that the Spurs were never again known as the "San Antonio softies". The magazine commended Finals MVP Duncan, who was later cited: "This is staggering. We maintained our concentration and we hauled it out." "Sports Illustrated" writer and resigned NBA player Alex English included: "Duncan came up huge each time they went to him with that sweet turnaround jumper off the glass. He was the man today around evening time [in Game 5]." And Popovich later said to losing mentor Jeff Van Gundy: "I have Tim [Duncan] and you don't. That is the distinction." 

In the 1999â 2000 season, Duncan further solidified his notoriety. He found the middle value of 23.2 focuses, 12.4 bounce back, 3.2 helps and 2.2 squares per amusement, earned another pair of All-NBA and All-Defense First Team call-ups, and was co-MVP with Shaquille O'Neal of the NBA All-Star Game. In any case, the Spurs had a disillusioning post-season. Duncan harmed his meniscus without further ado before the finish of the ordinary season and was unfit to play in even one post-season amusement. Thus, the Spurs were wiped out in the first round of the 2000 NBA Playoffs, losing 3â 1 to the Phoenix Suns. Regardless, Duncan bounced back in the following season, and with solid ordinary season midpoints of 22.2 focuses, 12.2 bounce back, 3.0 helps and 2.3 squares, earned himself one more pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team call-ups. In the 2001 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs dispensed with the Timberwolves 3â 1, vanquished the Dallas Mavericks 4â 1, yet then bowed out against the Lakers driven by hotshots Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, losing in four straight diversions. "Sports Illustrated" portrayed the arrangement as a "[m]erciless confuse", and Duncan was scrutinized as "quiet when the Spurs need him most". 

On the back of two continuous playoff disillusionments, Duncan improved measurably in the 2001â 02 season. He arrived at the midpoint of vocation highs in scoring (25.5 focuses per diversion, including a class driving 764 field objectives and 560 endeavored free tosses) and bouncing back (12.7 sheets per amusement, and his collected 1042 sheets again drove the alliance), and furthermore found the middle value of 3.7 helps and 2.5 squares per diversion, both profession highs. Combined with another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team call-ups, he was named the class' Most Valuable Player, joining colleague David Robinson as the main Spurs individuals to procure the respect. Then again, Duncan's group battled with the way that the maturing Robinson was never again ready to support his dimension of execution, and reinforcement focus forward Malik Rose needed to venture in more frequently. In the 2002 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs were again outmatched by the Lakers. Facing star focus O'Neal yet again, the Spurs were vanquished 4â 1 by the inevitable heroes. Duncan, who oversaw 34 and an establishment high 25 bounce back in Game 5, expressed his dissatisfaction: "I thought we truly got an opportunity at this arrangement. The Lakers turned out to be beyond what we could deal with. Once more, we had a (hell) of a keep running at it. We had chances to win amusements and make it an alternate arrangement, however that is only the manner in which the ball rolls once in a while." Nevertheless, NBA.com commended Duncan as "marvelous" and censured his supporting cast, expressing Duncan "made 11-of-23 shots and 12-of-14 free tosses, including four helps and two squares [a]nd by and by, he didn't have enough help." Also, Robinson said "Tim [Duncan] resembled Superman out there", and surrendered that the Lakers were essentially better, much the same as in the last playoffs battle. 

The 2002â 03 season saw Duncan appreciate another champion season in which he arrived at the midpoint of 23.3 focuses, a vocation high 12.9 bounce back, 3.9 helps and 2.9 squares per amusement, but then another double All-NBA and All-Defense First Team call-up, bringing about his second NBA Most Valuable Player Award. At age 37, Robinson declared that year as his last season, and his playing time was sliced by mentor Popovich to spare his vitality for the playoffs. The Spurs qualified effectively for the playoffs, closing the ordinary season as the Conference number one seed with a 60â 22 record. Despite the fact that San Antonio now had new hostile dangers in Tony Parker and Manu GinÃ³bili, amid the playoffs, it was Duncan's execution in the semi-finals against the Los Angeles Lakers which was singled out for acclaim by Popovich, who expressed: "I thought in Game 5 and Game 6, he [Duncan] was bewildering in his core interest. He pulled everybody along these last two amusements." In the arrangement, Duncan was coordinated facing forward Robert Horry, and had the capacity to rule him the whole arrangement and finished off the arrangement in style; Duncan completed Game 6 with 37 and 16 bounce back, permitting Spurs mentor Popovich to call timeout with 2:26 left to train his group not to celebrate too much. The Spurs made it to the finals, and crushed the New Jersey Nets 88â 77 in Game 6 to win another NBA title. Aided by a motivated Robinson, Duncan nearly recorded a fourfold twofold in the last diversion, and was named the NBA Finals MVP. Duncan said of the triumph: "We were all certain that something would occur, that we would turn the diversion to our support, and it did", however felt pitiful that Robinson resigned in the wake of winning his second title ring. Following this fruitful Spurs crusade, Robinson and Duncan were named "Sports Illustrated"s 2003 "Sportsmen of the Year". 

Before the 2003â 04 season started, the Spurs lost their enduring skipper David Robinson to retirement. Grasping the solitary group pioneer job, Duncan drove an improved Spurs group which included Slovenian focus Rasho NesteroviÄ, cautious stalwart Bruce Bowen, Argentinian shooting watch GinÃ³bili and youthful French point monitor Parker. Falling off the seat were grasp shooting power forward Robert Horry, flexible Hedo TÃ¼rkoÄlu and veterans Malik Rose and Kevin Willis. By and large, Robinson remarked that at first, Duncan was hesitant to venture into the void, as yet requiring some an opportunity to genuinely build up his authority aptitudes. Factually however, Duncan stayed solid; after another persuading season with midpoints of 22.3 focuses, 12.4 bounce back, 3.1 helps and 2.7 squares, he drove the Spurs into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers once more, split the arrangement 2â 2, and in Game 5, Duncan made an intensely shielded hop shot which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. In spite of the brief period remaining, Lakers point monitor Derek Fisher hit a bell blender for an agitated Lakers win. At last, the Spurs lost the arrangement 4â 2, and Duncan ascribed the solid Lakers protection as one reason for the misfortune. 

Duncan and his Spurs looked to re-champion themselves in the following 2004â 05 season. Regardless of their new chief's slight measurable droop (20.3 focuses, 11.1 bounce back, 2.7 helps, 2.6 squares per diversion), the Spurs won the second seed for the 2005 NBA Playoffs by winning 59 amusements. In the first round, the Spurs killed the Denver Nuggets four diversions to one, and met the Seattle SuperSonics in the semi-finals. In the wake of part the initial four amusements, Duncan drove his group to two unequivocal triumphs, setting up a gathering with the Phoenix Suns, known for their up-beat ball. The Spurs figured out how to beat the Suns unexpectedly, crushing them 4â 1 and winning a spot in the 2005 NBA Finals against the Detroit Pistons. In the Finals, Duncan was hollowed against Detroit's protectively solid frontcourt secured by various NBA Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace. After two persuading Game 1 and 2 wins for the Spurs, the Pistons twofold joined Duncan and constrained him to play further from the crate. Detroit won the following two recreations and the arrangement was in the end tied at 3â 3, yet Duncan was instrumental in Game 7, recording 25 points and 11 bounce back as the Spurs crushed the Pistons. NBA.com announced that "with his special multidimensional ability, Duncan exhausted and dismembered the Pistons... He was the support of for all intents and purposes each key play down the stretch", and mentor Popovich included: "[Duncan's] complete amusement is so stable, so major, so unnoticed now and again, in such a case that he didn't score, individuals think, 'Well, he didn't do anything'. In any case, he was mind blowing and he was the power that completed it for us." Pistons focus Ben Wallace commented: "He put his group on his shoulders and conveyed them to a title [...t]hat's what the extraordinary players do." Duncan won his third NBA Finals MVP Award, joining Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, and Magic Johnson as the main players in NBA history to win it multiple times. 

Amid the 2005â 06 season, Duncan experienced plantar fasciitis for the vast majority of the period, which was in any event halfway in charge of his sinking yield (18.6 focuses, 11.0 bounce back, 3.2 helps and 2.0 squares per diversion), and furthermore for his inability to make the All-NBA First Team after eight continuous appearances. The enormous man returned solid in the 2006 NBA Playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival control forward Dirk Nowitzki 32.2 to 27.1 focuses, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks focus Erick Dampier ready to stop Duncan with their man-to-man safeguard. Yet, in the wake of part the initial six recreations, Duncan turned into the heartbreaking saint of his group in Game 7. Regardless of scoring 39 points in guideline time and fouling out both Dampier and Keith Van Horn, Duncan just made one of seven field objective endeavors in additional time against Mavericks hold focus DeSagana Diop, and the Spurs lost Game 7. 

The accompanying season, be that as it may, was another title year for Duncan and the Spurs. Duncan arrived at the midpoint of 20.0 focuses, 10.6 bounce back, 3.4 helps and 2.4 squares per amusement in the normal season, and was chosen as a Western Conference starter for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, his ninth appearance in the occasion. In the playoffs, he drove the Spurs to a 4â 1 arrangement win over the Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, a 4â 2 success over the Phoenix Suns in the second round, and a 4â 1 success against the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Finals, setting up a gathering with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals. There, the Spurs cleared the Cavaliers 4â 0, winning Duncan his and San Antonio's fourth since forever title. Duncan broadcasted that that title was "the best" of his four titles; nonetheless, he additionally recognized he played "inferior" and in this manner got just a single vote in favor of NBA Finals MVP from a board of ten. His partners were increasingly keen to Duncan; among others, ex-colleague David Robinson alluded to the Spurs titles as the "Tim Duncan time", and commended his authority. Mentor Popovich additionally commended Duncan: "Tim is the shared factor. He's [had] an alternate cast around him [in] '99, '03 and '05. He's invited them all. [...] But he is that simple to play with, and his aptitudes are so on a very basic level sound that other individuals can fit in." Then-NBA official David Stern included: "[Duncan] is a player for the ages. I'm a tennis fan, and Pete Sampras is one of the greats. Alright, he wasn't Andre Agassi or John McEnroe. He simply happens to be one of the best players ever. You accept incredible players as you discover them." 

Amid the 2008 NBA All-Star Weekend, Duncan was an individual from the San Antonio group that won the Shooting Stars Competition. For the season, he played 78 recreations and posted his commonplace 20/10 numbers, San Antonio closed the 2007â 08 customary season with a 56â 26 record, completing behind the Lakers and New Orleans Hornets in the Western Conference and setting up themselves for a first-round challenge against the Suns. The Sunsâcrushed by the Spurs in three of the previous four periods of playoffsâwere out for retribution and included another player in four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal. In Game 1, Duncan set the tone with a 40-point amusement and an uncommon three-pointer that sent the diversion into twofold extra time. The trio of Duncan, GinÃ³bili and Parker kept playing to shape for the rest of the arrangement, and the Spurs dispensed with the Suns in five amusements. In the primary round of the following round against the Chris Paul-drove Hornets, San Antonio was severely vanquished 101â 82 as Duncan played one of the most exceedingly bad playoff diversions in his vocation, recording just 5 points and 3 bounce back. The Spurs dropped the following amusement also, however recuperated in Games 3 and 4, with Duncan setting up a group high 22 point/15 bounce back/4 square execution in the diversion that tied the arrangement. Duncan at that point recorded 20 points and 15 bounce back in Game 6, and the Spurs depended on their experience to seal the arrangement in Game 7. Be that as it may, most outstanding adversaries Los Angeles Lakers vanquished San Antonio in five amusements in the Conference Finals, and the Spurs by and by neglected to catch consecutive NBA titles. 

Duncan began the 2008â 09 season with solid showings in focuses and bounce back per diversion. Be that as it may, by mid-season, his execution declined and he was accordingly determined to have constant knee tendinosis. Regardless of Duncan having issues with his knee and the group losing the administrations of shooting monitor GinÃ³bili for a large portion of the period, San Antonio fit the bill for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54â 28 record. Combined with a maturing supporting cast (Bowen, Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s), be that as it may, the Spurs were just viewed as periphery contenders for the title. As it turned out, Duncan and Parker were insufficient to enable the Spurs to maintain a strategic distance from a 4â 1 thrashing by Dallas, and the Spurs were dispensed with in the first round of the playoffs out of the blue since 2000. 

With the Spurs hoping to give a progressively strong supporting cast in the 2009â 10 season, they procured Richard Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Antonio McDyess, DeJuan Blair, and Keith Bogans. The group got off to a 5â 6 begin, however a progression of twofold exhibitions by Duncan gave them a 9â 6 record before the finish of November. Duncan was therefore named the Western Conference Player of the Week for the most recent seven day stretch of November. Indeed, even at 34 years old, he remained a consistent 20â 10 risk, being just a single of three players in the association at the mid-season to average no less than 20 points and 10 bounce back an amusement.

Subsequent to verifying one more 50-win season, the Spurs fit the bill for the playoffs as the seventh seed, and crushed Dallas 4â 2 in the first round, just to lose 4â 0 to Phoenix in the following round. 

Eleven recreations into the 2010â 11 season, Duncan turned into the Spurs' record-breaking pioneer in focuses scored and diversions played. En route, the Spurs ordered a 12-amusement series of wins to go 13â 2 after 15 diversions. On November 30, 2010, Duncan recorded his third vocation triple-twofold against the Golden State Warriors. after 12 days, in a diversion against the Portland Trail Blazers, Duncan turned into the 94th player in NBA history to play 1,000 recreations. Through his 1,000th diversion, the Spurs have been 707â 293; just Scottie Pippen (715â 285) had a superior record with his group through his initial 1,000 amusements. The Spurs were 29â 4 after 33 diversionsâone of the ten best begins in NBA historyâ and drove the class at 35â 6 part of the way through the season. Despite the fact that Duncan created profession lows in focuses and bounce back per diversion, the Spurs finished the standard season as the primary seed in the West for the 2011 NBA Playoffs, and were second in the class (to Chicago). Notwithstanding completing with a 61â 21 record, be that as it may, the Spurs couldn't abstain from being disturbed in the first round, 4â 2, by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies.

Preceding a diversion against the Philadelphia 76ers on March 24, 2012, head mentor Gregg Popovich chose to allow Duncan a night off by posting him on the official scorecard as "DNP-OLD", making jokes about his 36-year-old body.
