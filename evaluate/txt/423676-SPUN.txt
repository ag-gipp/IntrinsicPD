In Buffalo, wearing number 39, he was at first the reinforcement goaltender, playing behind Grant Fuhr. At the point when Fuhr was harmed halfway through the 1993â 94 season, HaÅ¡ek was raised to starter and before long formed into a top-level goaltender.

The objective was not surveyed promptly, so authorities did not see Hull's foot in the wrinkle until some other time.
