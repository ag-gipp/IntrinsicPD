2008 Humanitarian Bowl 

The 2008 Humanitarian Bowl was a postseason school football bowl diversion between the Maryland Terrapins and the Nevada Wolf Pack on December 30, 2008. It was the two groups' first gathering. The diversion included two meeting tie-ins: the University of Maryland spoke to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and the University of Nevada spoke to the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). The diversion was played at Bronco Stadium in Boise, Idaho and was the twelfth release of the Humanitarian Bowl. It was supported by the New Plymouth, Idaho-based organization Roady's Truck Stops, which professes to be the biggest chain of truck stops in the United States. 

The highlighted coordinate was between what was known as an "uncontrollably conflicting" Maryland group and the third-best surging barrier and fifth-best absolute offense of Nevada. The outcome was a hostile shoot-out. The last score of 42â 35 for Maryland surpassed all out focuses forecasts by as much as 17 and tied the unsurpassed Humanitarian Bowl record. 

Prior to the kickoff, seven Maryland players, including six starters, got halfway diversion suspensions for disregarding the group's time limitation. Maryland took a speedy lead inside the initial two minutes of play, yet rehashed mistakes enabled Nevada to stay aggressive and the lead changed hands multiple times. In the second quarter, Nevada's double danger quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, was limped by a lower leg damage that modified the appearance of the amusement. All things considered, Kaepernick stayed in the diversion for nearly its total and had the capacity to scramble for a touchdown. Part of the way through the second from last quarter, Maryland's driving running back, Da'Rel Scott, showed up of the diversion. He had been one of the suspended players, yet scored twice in the last quarter to help secure a triumph for the Terrapins. 

The ACC had a legally binding tie-in with the Humanitarian Bowl that managed the bowl sorting out board of trustees the eighth pick of the meeting's bowl-qualified groups. An ACC group took part in the amusement consistently from 2003 to 2008. Prior to the determinations, the ACC reported that 2008 would be the last year of its tie-in with the amusement because of movement and cost contemplations. 

The other gathering tie-in was with the WAC, which has for the most part handled its hero in the amusement. The WAC has given a group to the Humanitarian Bowl each year since 2001. At first, it was conjectured that the WAC title group, Boise State, would show up in the bowl played in its home arena. 

Toward the finish of the customary season, there were three undefeated groups from non-Bowl Championship Series (BCS) meetings, and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules required just a single to be given a billet in a BCS amusement. These three non-BCS groups were Ball State, Boise State, and Utah. The Utes were viewed as overwhelming top choices for that compartment. In a preemptive move, Humanitarian Bowl authorities led exchanges with Ball State of the Mid-American Conference (MAC) with an end goal to orchestrate a "Skirmish of the Unbeatens" with Boise State. In the event that Ball State acknowledged, probably with the assent of the ACC, it would have constrained a group from the ACC to discover an everywhere offer. In any case, Ball State authorities were discontent with the home-field advantage that would have been given to Boise State and the costs related with heading out to Idaho. Ball State, which lost the MAC Championship Game and finished its ideal record, declined the suggestions and rather met Tulsa in the 2009 GMAC Bowl. 

In 2008, the ACC encountered a period of surprising equality and handled a NCAA-record number of ten bowl-qualified groups. Six of those had indistinguishable 4â 4 meeting records, and the staying four had 5â 3 gathering records. Among the qualified groups, N.C. State (6â 6) had the main non-winning in general record and was along these lines constrained by NCAA tenets to discover an everywhere billet outside of the ACC tie-in amusements. 

For the 2008 season, the ACC had nine tie-in amusements. The Orange Bowl was the gathering's BCS amusement and allowed a programmed offer to the victor of the ACC Championship Game. The Chick-fil-A Bowl in Atlanta, Georgia had the main pick of qualified ACC groups after the BCS amusement, trailed by the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida and the Champs Sports Bowl in Orlando, Florida. The Music City Bowl in Nashville, Tennessee; the Meineke Car Care Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina; and the Emerald Bowl in San Francisco, California presented their inclinations together, and chose in a specific order if an understanding between them couldn't be come to. An exceptional condition additionally ensured that, with at least eight successes, the failure of the title diversion would be chosen no lower than by the Music City Bowl. The Humanitarian Bowl had the eighth-generally speaking decision pursued by the debut EagleBank Bowl in Washington, D.C. 

That season, a monetary subsidence considered into the determinations. By and large, bowl authorities endeavored to choose groups in close geographic vicinity to make up for a foreseen drop in ticket deals. Maryland, in any case, expressed that they would not acknowledge a billet to look in-state rival Navy in the close-by EagleBank Bowl because of a contention with the school's last, most important tests. The Emerald Bowl was not seen as a practical decision because of Maryland's support in it the year earlier. 

Maryland head mentor Ralph Friedgen presented his defense to bowl authorities by saying that the Terrapins had beaten four of the other five 4â 4 groups and not played a diversion against the fifth, Miami. Three of those groups were chosen in front of Maryland: the Meineke Car Care Bowl chosen the close-by North Carolina group; the Gator Bowl picked Clemson, a school with a generally well-voyaging fanbase; and the Emerald Bowl chosen Miami. After the higher-need bowl recreations made their choices, the Humanitarian Bowl had the decision of either Maryland or Wake Forest, the school with the littlest enlistment in any BCS football meeting. Compassionate Bowl authorities picked Maryland in light of its bigger graduated class base, all around voyaged fans, and more prominent TV advertising potential. 

In week 12 of the 2008 season, Maryland had a 7â 3 record and remained on the ACC Atlantic Division. Nonetheless, the Terps lost their last two standard season recreations and slid to a four-route tie for third spot in the division. Prior in the season, Maryland crushed four positioned adversaries, an accomplishment outperformed just by the two groups that played in the BCS National Championship Game, Florida and Oklahomaâand those each played an additional amusement with their meeting titles. Maryland went through three weeks positioned in the best 25 of the Associated Press Poll. 

Toward the finish of the 2008 season, the WAC had six bowl-qualified groups, five of which took an interest in bowl amusements. The WAC had three gathering tie-ins: the New Mexico Bowl in Albuquerque, New Mexico; the Hawaii Bowl in Honolulu, Hawaii; and the Humanitarian Bowl. Moreover, the WAC had arrangements for contingent cooperation in the Poinsettia Bowl in San Diego, California; the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana; and the GMAC Bowl in Mobile, Alabama. 

Previously, the Humanitarian Bowl normally chosen the WAC title group. Be that as it may, Boise State was not substance to play a center evaluation ACC group after arrangements with Ball State fizzled. The WAC magistrate said that the Broncos would search for another coordinate that had "a similar kind of sizzle" as a coordinate against Ball State. The "Idaho Statesman" included that "The Terrapins don't 'sizzle.'" Boise State headed out to the Poinsettia Bowl, where they confronted eleventh positioned TCU, which had lost just to the BCS-bound Oklahoma and Utah groups. 

In Nevada's last customary season amusement, Kaepernick drove the Wolf Pack in a second-half rebound to crush Louisiana Tech. The seventh win ensured Nevada a compartment in one of the three WAC tie-in dishes. The Wolf Pack completed the season in a three-manner tie for second spot in the WAC close by Hawaii and Louisiana Tech. Hawaii had a standing contract with the main residence Hawaii Bowl where it played Notre Dame. Louisiana Tech, having lost to both Nevada and Hawaii, seemed probably not going to be chosen for a bowl by any stretch of the imagination. In any case, the Bulldogs had the capacity to exploit a temporary WAC compartment in the Independence Bowl since neither the Big 12 nor the Southeastern Conference could give qualified groups. Two other WAC groups accomplished bowl qualification with 6â 6 records. Fresno State verified a space in the New Mexico Bowl, however San Jose State was unfit to discover an everywhere billet. 

With Boise State's choice to decrease the Humanitarian Bowl welcome, the sorting out advisory group looked to Nevada. Like Maryland, Nevada finished the customary season with a 7â 5 record. The Wolf Pack's timetable included misfortunes against then 6th positioned Missouri, ninth-positioned Boise State, and twelfth positioned Texas Tech. Nevada completed the customary season positioned second broadly in hurrying offense and fifth in all out offense. The Wolf Pack had two 1,000-yard rushers: double danger quarterback Colin Kaepernick and running back Vai Taua. Kaepernick additionally tossed for more than 2,000Â yards. 

On December 7, 2008, the Humanitarian Bowl formally stretched out solicitations to Maryland and Nevada, the two of which were acknowledged. 

The site of the diversion was Bronco Stadium in Boise, Idaho, the home field of Boise State University. The field's blue fake turf has the refinement of being the main non-green playing field being used by a Division I Football Bowl Subdivision group. Because of the shade of its field, the arena is nicknamed "The Blue" and the field itself is some of the time informally alluded to as "smurf turf". 

Savants and rivals have declared that Boise State profits by an additional preferred standpoint by wearing their blue home garbs to coordinate the playing field. Boise State had a 64â 2 record at Bronco Stadium from 1998 to 2008. Nevada, assigned as the home group, in like manner wore blue garbs amid the Humanitarian Bowl. 

ACC groups saw a compartment in the Humanitarian Bowl as bothersome because of its area. Beside being one of the lower need tie-ins, the goal is far outside the meeting's geographic impression. Travel costs from the East Coast are restrictively costly and generally caused low turnout among ACC fans. Likewise, the amusement is facilitated at a chilly climate scene, which is a weakness in examination with ACC bowl diversions in spots, for example, Florida, California, and Georgia. 

The amusement truly depended on nearby ticket deals, and the partaking schools attempted to sell their dispensed tickets. On December 8, a Boise-zone TV news station detailed that Maryland and Nevada had sold only sixteen and eight tickets, separately. The story was generally coursed by games related sites, yet the figures were defamed by a Maryland official. On December 18, the Reno Gazette-Journal announced that 100 tickets had been sold by Nevada. Maryland authorities conceded that ticket deals among its fans were relied upon to be low, with one expressing they were in the "mid-hundreds" a week and a half from the diversion date. As per a "Baltimore Sun" columnist, Maryland's last ticket figure was around 800. By correlation, Clemson sold around 3,500 tickets for the 2001 Humanitarian Bowl, and Georgia Tech sold about 250Â tickets for the 2007 Humanitarian Bowl. 

Forecasts for the amusement changed, yet for the most part supported Nevada with Maryland as the dark horse. A few productions, including "Sports Illustrated", named Nevada as three-point top picks in spread wagering. ESPN's ACC reporter anticipated Nevada to win by 21Â points. Las Vegas wagering firms allocated Nevada as 0.5-to 3.0-point top choices. The over-under was anticipated to be somewhere in the range of 60.0 and 62.0Â points. 

Under head mentor Ralph Friedgen, Maryland had earned a notoriety for irregularity, now and again notwithstanding being alluded to as "schizophrenic". Amid the ordinary season, the Terrapins figured out how to beat four of the five top-25 groups they confronted: 23rd-positioned California, twentieth positioned Clemson, 21st-positioned Wake Forest, and sixteenth positioned North Carolina. Those groups therefore took an interest in bowl diversions. Notwithstanding, Maryland likewise lost to groups they were relied upon to overcome. They lost by ten to 12.5-point longshots Middle Tennessee State. Maryland endured a 31-point shut-out against Virginia, a group (at that point 1â 3) that had lost to Duke, 31â 3, the week earlier. 

Nevada endured three of its five misfortunes against then top-twelve positioned groups. They lost to Big 12 Championship sprinter up Missouri and Texas Tech, which, in middle of the season, was in conflict for the national title and was driven by Heisman Trophy prospect Graham Harrell. Nevada dealt with a nearby diversion against Boise State. The Wolf Pack lost by sevenÂ points to a group that recorded a normal 21.4-point edge of triumph in an ideal 12â 0Â regular season. Boise State safeguarded triumph when a Hail Mary go from Kaepernick was separated in the last seconds. Nevada, notwithstanding, was additionally blamed for conflicting play. The Wolf Pack endured a home misfortune to "lasting WAC scavenger" New Mexico State, 48â 45. 

Maryland's offense was controlled by first-year hostile facilitator and previous wide beneficiaries mentor James Franklin, who used a West Coast framework. Amid the 2008 standard season, beginning quarterback Chris Turner tossed for 2,318Â yards, 11Â touchdowns, and 10Â interceptions. NFL Draft prospect Darrius Heyward-Bey aggregated 561Â receiving yards in ten recreations. Heyward-Bey likewise recorded 208Â rushing yards and was regularly used in turns around and other trap plays because of his breakaway speed. Maryland had another hostile weapon in running back Da'Rel Scott, who kept running for 959Â yards amid the normal season. By and large, the surging offense increased 134.5Â yards per diversion and was positioned 72nd in the country. Against Virginia Tech and Boston College, Maryland scrambled for â12Â and â6Â yards, individually. The earlier year, in the 2007 Emerald Bowl against Oregon State, Maryland recorded 19Â yards on the ground against the then second-positioned hurrying safeguard. 

About Maryland, Nevada head mentor Chris Ault stated, "Their offense to me is adjusted. They can run the ball and work superbly. With [quarterback Chris] Turner, they split out and they have some decent collectors. Though Missouri was going to toss it as much as Texas Tech did, I think Maryland is most likely one of the more adjusted groups we've played for this present year." 

The Maryland offense confronted first-year cautious facilitator Nigel Burton's Nevada barrier. It positioned third in the country against the run, permitting 74.5Â rushing yards per amusement, yet was last (120th) in the country in passing protection, permitting a normal of 321.1Â passing yards per diversion. Nevada was positioned eighth in the quantity of quarterback sacks with 35. Kevin Basped, positioned tenth in the country in sacks, and Dontay Moch, positioned fifteenth, aggregated in excess of nine each. Maryland quarterback Turner was sacked 11Â times in the Terrapins' last two amusements against Florida State and Boston College. Nevada was likewise positioned 6th broadly in handles for misfortune, with a normal of 8.0Â per diversion. 

In 2008, Nevada regularly ran a hostile plan alluded to as the "gun offense", a framework that was spearheaded by head mentor Chris Ault. In the gun offense, the quarterback lines up four yards straightforwardly behind the inside and with a running back legitimately behind the quarterback. Under the framework, the offense endeavors to keep the contradicting protection shaky by broadening the sorts of plays that can be run, with an attention on running up the center, "quarterback attendants" in which the passer runs the ball, and play activity passes where the quarterback fakes a hand-off before tossing to a collector. It means to make man-to-man coordinate ups with the beneficiaries and adjust for an undersized hostile line. With the running back clouded from view by the quarterback, it can likewise make perplexity for the contradicting linebackers and permit progressively powerful misleading, which is basic to play-activity fakes. 

The framework functioned admirably amid the customary season. Nevada beginning quarterback and 2008 WAC Offensive Player of the Year Colin Kaepernick kept running for more than 16Â touchdowns notwithstanding going for 19Â touchdowns. Nearby Kaepernick, Nevada's hurrying offense was driven by running back Vai Taua, who kept running for 14Â touchdowns. With two 1,000-yard rushers without precedent for school history, Nevada kept running for a normal of 291.4Â yards per diversion. Nevada was positioned fifth broadly as far as complete offense, averaging 510.6Â yards per diversion. 

With respect to confronting the gun offense, Maryland head mentor Ralph Friedgen stated, "In the event that we can keep our assignments and handle, we'll be OK. One missed handle could be a major playÂ ... With the tossing diversion, there could be a great deal of one-on-one circumstances. To me, it's pick your toxic substance. What they specialize in is run it. What we'd like to do is get them off timetable. On the off chance that they blend it, at that point we're stuck in an unfortunate situation." 

Nevada mentor Ault stated, "I think the Maryland barrier is as physical as Missouri's might have been." Kaepernick stated, "You see how restrained and how hard they play. They're never crooked. On the off chance that they should be some place, they will be there and they will be prepared to make a play. At the point when plays come their direction, they make them. That is something we must be prepared for. We need to discover a shortcoming and endeavor it." 

After Maryland's last standard season diversion, cautious organizer Chris Cosh and tight finishes mentor and exceptional groups right hand Danny Pearman reported their abdications. Cosh came back to Kansas State, where he had instructed before Maryland, to accept guarded play-calling obligations under as of late re-enlisted head mentor Bill Snyder. Danny Pearman came back to his place of graduation, Clemson, to work for Dabo Swinney, who had been elevated from hostile organizer to between time head mentor and, at long last, head mentor for the Tigers. For the bowl diversion, Maryland's guarded line mentor, Al Seamonson, was named as the interval cautious facilitator. Third-year understudy Brian White filled in for Pearman as the between time tight closures mentor and would help head mentor Friedgen in running the extraordinary groups. 

Quickly before the amusement, Maryland head mentor Ralph Friedgen set incomplete diversion suspensions on seven players who abused the group's pre-bowl time limitation. The suspended players were linebackers Moise Fokou, Trey Covington, Antwine Perez, and Derek Drummond, cornerback Jamari McCollough, the quarterback's favored third-down wide recipient Danny Oquendo, and driving running back Da'Rel Scott. All with the exception of Drummond were standard starters. Therefore, an a lot more youthful line-up began for Maryland, including, as indicated by Friedgen, some who most likely would not have seen playing time generally. 

Friedgen expressed that the time limitation infringement happened more than a few evenings, and that diverse players abused the standard to isolate degrees. He educated Maryland athletic chief Deborah Yow of the infractions and at first proposed sending the majority of the time limitation violators back to Maryland by transport. Yow disagreed, and they consented to suspend the players for part of the amusement. Depicting the episode, Friedgen said that "Five percent of [the] folks figured they didn't have to hear me out, that they could get bed looked at and sneak." He included, "However I checked again at 1 o'clock. "This isn't my first rodeo."
