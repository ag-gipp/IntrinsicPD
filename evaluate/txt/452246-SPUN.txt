Transparency 

Transparency is a town alongside the mouth of the River Medway on the north-west corner of the Isle of Sheppey in north Kent, England. With a populace of 12,000 it is the biggest town on the island. 

Transparency started as a stronghold worked in the 16 century to shield the River Medway from maritime attack. In 1665 plans were first laid by the Navy Board for Sheerness Dockyard, an office where warships may be provisioned and fixed. The site was supported by Samuel Pepys, at that point Clerk of the Acts of the naval force, for shipbuilding over Chatham inland. After the strike on the Medway in 1667, the more established stronghold was reinforced; in 1669 a Royal Navy dockyard was set up in the town, where warships were supplied and fixed until its conclusion in 1960. 

Starting with the development of a wharf and a promenade in the 19 century, Sheerness procured the additional attractions of a coastline resort.

The town is the site of one of the UK's first co-employable social orders and furthermore of the world's first multi-story structures with an unbending metal edge. 

The main structure in what is presently Sheerness was a stronghold worked by request of Henry VIII to keep foe ships from entering the River Medway and assaulting the maritime dockyard at Chatham. In 1666 work started to supplant it with a more grounded fortification. Notwithstanding, before its finish, this second post was annihilated amid the 1667 Dutch Naval Fleet as a component of what might be known as the assault on the Medway. 

The Secretary to the Admiralty, Samuel Pepys, in this way requested the development of Sheerness Dockyard as an expansion to that at Chatham. There was no settled settlement in the region of Sheerness, so the greater part of the laborers were at first housed in masses. By 1738, dockyard development laborers had assembled the main houses in Sheerness, utilizing materials they were permitted to take from the yard. The dark blue maritime paint they utilized on the outsides prompted their homes getting to be known as the Blue Houses. This was in the long run undermined to Blue Town (which is presently the name of the north-west zone of Sheerness lying just past the present dockyard edge). The cutting edge town of Sheerness has its birthplaces in Mile Town, which was built up later in the eighteenth century at a mile's separation from the dockyard (Blue Town having by then filled the space accessible). 

In 1797, malcontented mariners in the Royal Navy mutinied simply off the shoreline of Sheerness.
