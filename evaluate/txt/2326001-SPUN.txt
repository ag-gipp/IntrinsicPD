The World Is Not Enough (melody) 

"The World Is Not Enough" is the signature melody from the eponymous 1999 James Bond film, performed by American-Scottish elective musical crew Garbage. The tune was composed by arranger David Arnold (who additionally scored the film) and lyricist Don Black, beforehand in charge of four other Bond melodies, and was created by Garbage and Arnold. "The World Is Not Enough" was made in the style out of the arrangement's title tunes, interestingly with the post-present day creation and kind jumping of Garbage's initial two collections. The gathering recorded a large portion of "The World Is Not Enough" while visiting Europe in help of their collection "Rendition 2.0", calling Arnold as he recorded the symphonic support in London before going to England. Trash later completed the process of chronicle and blending the tune at Armory Studios in Canada. The verses mirror the film's plot (told from the perspective of foe Elektra King), with topics of global control and enchantment. 

The melody and its going with soundtrack were discharged universally by Radioactive Records when the film debuted worldwide toward the finish of November 1999. "The World Is Not Enough" was commended by analysts; it achieved the main forty of ten singles graphs and the best ten of four. It was incorporated on the James Bond assemblage "The Best of Bond... James Bond" and Garbage's most prominent hits collection, "Total Garbage". 

In September 1998 Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, proprietors of Eon Productions and long-lasting makers of James Bond films, picked David Arnold to create the score for the nineteenth Bond motion picture (planned for discharge in November of the next year). Arnold made the score for "Tomorrow Never Dies", the past film, and regulated the chronicle of "" (a collection of spread variants recorded by contemporary craftsmen including Pulp, Aimee Mann and David McAlmont). Arnold and the film's generation group needed an early unfinished version of the tune so components of its song could be fused into the principle score. Executive Michael Apted thought the utilization of "No one Does It Better" as an affection topic all through "The Spy Who Loved Me" compelling, and he needed Arnold to utilize that as a kind of perspective point. 

Arnold needed a signature tune wedding the "great Bond sound" with the electronica that would impact a large portion of his score. An ensemble would be required as crowds expect conventional components in a Bond film, and without them "The World Is Not Enough" would be viewed as a nonexclusive activity motion picture. Getting the equalization right may be a "harmed cup", since the outcomes could sound excessively or too minimal like a Bond topic. Arnold worked together with lyricist Don Black on the melody. Dark, with 30 years of experience composing Bond topics, composed the verses to Tom Jones' "Thunderball", Shirley Bassey's "Precious stones Are Forever", Lulu's "The Man with the Golden Gun" and k.d. lang's end credits topic, "Surrender", from "Tomorrow Never Dies". Arnold and Black met a few times to examine verses for "The World Is Not Enough", additionally teaming up by telephone, fax and email. As per Arnold, he "hung some la-las together, and unexpectedly the [song] sprung up". Before the finish of 1998 he and Black completed the music and verses, with the exception of the scaffold (a differentiating area of around eight bars). 

The verses are from the perspective of Elektra King, the Bond young lady uncovered as the genius of the wretched plan. Its basic subjects are temptation and mastery, portrayed by Arnold as "a steel clench hand in a kid glove. It coaxes you in with its abnormal finger." Black included that in spite of the fact that the verses mirrored the film's plot, they were "obviously about global control" and "significantly progressively close to home and serious", summoning a "ballady and emotional" temperament. A line of exchange from the film, "There's no reason for living whether you can't feel invigorated," was incorporated into the verses. 

That month Arnold offered the topic to Garbage lead vocalist Shirley Manson, who was excited; Arnold said he "never heard somebody shouting down the telephone". After seven days he sent the band the unpleasant demo, which they affirmed. Manson mentioned a little change in the verses, loathing the line "I realize when to kiss and I realize when to slaughter", so Arnold and Black transformed "I" to "we" for the last form. 

Trash drummer and co-maker Butch Vig said that when the gathering added to film soundtracks, "one of our dreams is do the Bond subject or do the new Bond melody." Manson considered herself a devotee of the arrangement, "an organization I appreciate and has dependably caught my creative ability since I was a tyke", and the movies had a "reasonableness very like how we approach making music". The opportunity to record a Bond subject engaged her since "you realize it's going down in film history", and originating from Scotland, similar to unique Bond Sean Connery, "that is close and intrinsic in our way of life. It's not Bond if it's not Scottish!" The vocalist considered Garbage's music and the arrangement's ideas "something that you can appreciate superficially, yet underneath there are loads of clashing topics you can get into." 

Toward the start of August Garbage's inclusion was affirmed in an official statement from MGM and Radioactive Records, Shirley Manson's record name, which would discharge the soundtrack and the single. In spite of the fact that "Music Week" detailed that Jamiroquai, Robbie Williams, Sharleen Spiteri, BjÃ¶rk and Melanie C were dismissed by the makers before Garbage was picked, Arnold denied that different specialists had tried out; the single was appropriate just for a film, and was not made in view of a specific craftsman. 

The primary chronicles were made amid the European leg of Garbage's Version 2.0 world visit. In the wake of tuning in to the symphonic demo, the band chipped away at the key and rhythm. Rubbish utilized a versatile studio from various European urban areas to record material for Arnold, staying in contact by telephone as he delivered the tune's string course of action in London. Since the strings conveyed the structure of the tune, they must be finished and recorded before Manson could sing her parts. Arnold recorded the strings with a 60-piece symphony in one day at London's Metropolis Studios. 

Refuse traveled to London for multi day to record the essential tracks, setting down electric guitar, low pitch guitar and Manson's vocals with the ensemble. Manson called working with the symphony "invigorating". That night, the band traveled to Switzerland to continue their visit for three weeks. 

The last account was made in August at Armory Studios in Vancouver, Canada, where Garbage based upon their first blend of the melody, including and subtracting parts, and finished last chronicle and blending. The band kept the course of action tight to protect the tune's dynamic, clearing tune. "The ensemble occupied so much room and truly managed where the tune was going progressively," keeping the chronicle straightforward, Vig reviewed. "Other than the drums and bass and some percussive circles, there's a smidgen of guitar that Duke and Steve did. There's not a great deal of different tracks on there. There's a couple of little ear-treat things that we did, however it's everything intended to work around Shirley's singing." Although Garbage claimed its very own account studio in Madison, Wisconsin, for legitimate reasons the melody couldn't be recorded in a U.S. studio. "The World Is Not Enough" was finished, blended and aced toward the month's end, and the gathering came back to their account studio in Madison to record their blend of the tune. Refuse's form (the "relaxed remix") made light of the exemplary Bond sound for the band's style. Vig later said about the first chronicle, "We're really satisfied with how it turned out. To Garbage fans, it sounds like a Garbage melody. What's more, to Bond fans, it's a Bond melody." However, Manson noticed that the form included in the film "got our expectations and delights squashed," as "they had totally screwed with every one of the stems of blend and it sounded totally extraordinary." 

Two musicians, Frank P. Fogerty and Nathan Crow, sued Eon, MGM, Universal Music and Universal Studios for copyright encroachment over "The World Is Not Enough", charging that it got from their tune "This Game We Play", which was submitted to MGM officials in February 1999 for thought for the soundtrack of "The Thomas Crown Affair". Their case focused on a four-note arrangement in "The World Is Not Enough" which they claimed was indistinguishable to part of "This Game We Play". At the point when the lyricists were gathering proof, one acted like a representative of writer James Horner to contact Don Black and request his administrations for "Sea's Eleven". They recorded their discussion with Black, endeavoring to get him to reveal when he and Arnold formed "The World Is Not Enough", and reached Shirley Manson along these lines. 

The case was contended in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee in June 2004. The court dismissed the offended parties' case, reasoning that Arnold freely created "The World Is Not Enough" and it didn't impart an entry to "This Game We Play". The offended parties surrendered that Arnold did not approach "This Game We Play" after diary passages, conveyance solicitations, phone and PC records, composed statements from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli and declaration from David Arnold, Don Black, Shirley Manson and Arnold's own aide gave "undeniable proof" that "The World Is Not Enough" had just been composed and was not changed fundamentallyâother than a melodious modification (the evacuation of one line to oblige Shirley Manson) and an alteration to the score (the expulsion of the "three-note theme" to suit the MGM officials)â from the date that "This Game We Play" was submitted to MGM.
