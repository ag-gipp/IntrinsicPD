A novelization of the amusement was distributed in February 2013. 

"Divine force of War II" is an activity experience diversion with hack and slice components. It's a third-individual single-player computer game saw from a fixed camera viewpoint. The player controls the character Kratos in combo-based battle, platforming, and astound amusement components, and fights enemies who principally originate from Greek folklore, including wenches, minotaurs, Gorgons, griffins, cyclopes, cerberuses, Sirens, satyrs, and fairies. Different beasts were made explicitly for the diversion, including undead legionnaires, ravens, undead brutes, monster rulers, out of control dogs, wild pigs, and the military of the Fates, including guards, watchmen, juggernauts, and consecrated ministers. A large number of the mix assaults utilized in "Divine force of War" return, and the diversion includes more than twofold the measure of manager battles and more troublesome riddles than the first. Platforming components require the player to climb dividers and stepping stools, bounce crosswise over gorges, swing on ropes, and parity crosswise over bars to continue through segments of the amusement. A few riddles are basic, for example, moving a crate so the player can utilize it as a hopping off point to get to a pathway inaccessible with ordinary bouncing, while others are increasingly mind boggling, for example, finding a few things crosswise over various zones of the amusement to open one entryway. 

Notwithstanding the customary wellbeing, enchantment, and experience chests that are found all through the amusement world, there are three Uber Chests to be found. Two of these chests give an extra addition to the Health and Magic Meters, separately, and the third chest contains a wealth of red and gold circles. A few urns are likewise covered up in the diversion (e.g., the Urn of Gaia, endless supply of the amusement, opens unique capacities (e.g., boundless enchantment) for use amid reward play. 

Kratos' principle weapon is a couple of cutting edges appended to chains that are folded over the character's wrists and lower arms. Called Athena's Blades (otherwise called the Blades of Athena) in this amusement, they can be swung obnoxiously in different moves. As the diversion advances, Kratos procures new weaponsâthe Barbarian Hammer, the Spear of Destiny, and intermittently, the Blade of Olympusâoffering elective battle choices. In spite of the fact that Kratos starts the amusement with Athena's Blades and the enchantment capacity Poseidon's Rage (both at most extreme power), the cutting edges' capacity is diminished and the enchantment is surrendered after an experience with Zeus (Poseidon's Rage can be recaptured by getting a specific urn). Likewise with past diversions, Kratos figures out how to utilize around four supernatural capacities, for example, Typhon's Bane that goes about as a bow and bolt for removed targets, giving him an assortment of approaches to assault and slaughter adversaries. Other new supernatural capacities incorporate Cronos' Rage, Head of Euryale, and Atlas Quake. The extraordinary capacity Rage of the Gods, included in the past diversion is supplanted by Rage of the Titans; in contrast to the past amusement, the Rage meterâwhich permits use of the capacityâdoes not need to be full so as to utilize the capacity, and can be turned on and off voluntarily. 

Kratos holds the relic Poseidon's Trident from the first portion, and increases new relics; the Amulet of the Fates, the Golden Fleece, and Icarus' Wings, each being required to progress through specific phases of the amusement. For instance, the Amulet of the Fates moderates time, yet this does not influence Kratos and permits astound explaining that can not be accomplished in ordinary diversion time. The Amulet of the Fates has restricted utilization before waiting be revived (which happens consequently and is spoken to by the Amulet of the Fates Meter). The Golden Fleece redirects adversary shots back at the adversaries (used to settle certain riddles). Icarus' Wings permits Kratos to float crosswise over substantial gorges that can't be crossed with ordinary hopping. 

This current diversion's test mode is known as the Challenge of the Titans (seven preliminaries), and expects players to finish a progression of explicit errands (e.g., slaughter all foes without being assaulted). The player may open extra outfits for Kratos, off camera recordings, and idea specialty of the characters and situations, as remunerations, just as utilization of the capacities found in the urns amid the first playthrough. Fulfillment of every trouble level opens extra rewards, as does gathering twenty eyes from crushed cyclopes. Another mode, called Arena of the Fates, enables players to set trouble levels and pick their very own rivals to improve their abilities. 

Similarly as with its ancestor, "Divine force of War II" is set in a substitute variant of antiquated Greece, populated by the Olympian Gods, Titans, legends, and different creatures of Greek folklore. Except for flashbacks, the occasions are set between those of the diversions "" (2007) and "Divine force of War III" (2010). A few areas are investigated, including a certifiable setting in the old city of Rhodes, and a few anecdotal areas, incorporating a concise scene in the Underworld, the Lair of Typhon, the Island of Creation and its districts, Tartarus, and a short scene on Mount Olympus. 

Rhodes, its horizon overwhelmed by the monstrous statue, the Colossus of Rhodes, is a war-torn city under ambush by Kratos, the God of War, and his Spartan armed force. The Lair of Typhon, covered up in an obscure area, is a snow-topped mountain and jail of the Titans Typhon and Prometheus. The Island of Creation is an immense island situated at the edge of the world and home to the Sisters of Fate. The island is host to lethal snares, riddles, and beasts. On the edges of the island are the Steeds of Time, and on the island itself are the Temples of Lakhesis and Atropos, and the Bog of the Forgotten, which shrouds the Gorgon Euryale and is the site of Jason of the Argonauts' last fight. Past the Bog are the Lowlands and the Great Chasm: an immense partition that obstructs the route to the Palace of the Fates. At the base of the Chasm is the domain of Tartarusâjail of the Titan Atlas, sentenced to hold the world on his shoulders. The Temple of the Fates is likewise loaded up with snares and beasts, while the last fight happens on Mount Olympus, home to the divine beings.

Kratos, the new God of War, is as yet frequented by bad dreams of his past and is avoided by different divine beings for his dangerous ways. Overlooking Athena's admonitions, Kratos joins the Spartan armed force in an assault on Rhodes, amid which a monster falcon all of a sudden depletes him of his forces and invigorates the Colossus of Rhodes. While engaging the statue, Zeus offers Kratos the Blade of Olympus so as to overcome it, requiring Kratos to implant the edge with the rest of his genuine power. Albeit now human, Kratos routs the Colossus yet is mortally injured. The hawk uncovers itself to have been Zeus from the start, who states he was compelled to intercede as Athena wouldn't do as such. Zeus at that point stipends Kratos a last chance to be faithful to the divine beings, yet Kratos cannot. Zeus executes him with the edge and annihilates the Spartan armed force. 

Kratos is gradually hauled to the Underworld, yet is spared by the Titan Gaia. Gaia discloses to Kratos that she once raised the youthful Zeus, who in the long run sold out the Titans as retaliation for the savagery perpetrated on his kin by Zeus' dad, Cronos. She educates Kratos to discover the "Sisters of Fate", who can modify time, keep his passing, and permit him his vengeance on Zeus. With the guide of Pegasus, Kratos finds the refuge of Gaia's sibling Typhon. Detained under a mountain, Typhon is infuriated at the interruption and traps Pegasus, constraining Kratos to investigate by walking. Kratos experiences the Titan Prometheus, who is tied in mortal structure and tormented at Zeus' order for offering flame to humanity. Prometheus asks to be discharged from his torment, so Kratos goes up against Typhon to take his otherworldly bow. He blinds the huge Titan with it to escape and after that utilizes it to free Prometheus, who falls into a flame and kicks the bucket, at last free of interminable torment. The Immolation discharges the intensity of the Titans which Kratos assimilates, utilizing it to free Pegasus and after that fly to the Island of Creation. 

Just before achieving the island, Kratos battles and kills Theseus to stir the immense stone Steeds of Timeâa blessing to the Sisters of Fate from Cronos trying to change his own destinyâwhich gifts Kratos access to the island. There, Kratos experiences and thrashings a few adversaries, some of whom-themselves are likewise looking for the Sisters of Fate, including an undead variant of his old enemy the Barbarian King, the Gorgon Euryale, Perseus, and Icarus. He in the end experiences the detained Titan Atlas, who at first loathes Kratos for his . After Kratos clarifies his goal, Atlas uncovers that Gaia and different Titans likewise look for vengeance on Zeus for their thrashing in the Great War. Map book likewise uncovers that the Blade of Olympus is the way to overcoming Zeus and encourages Kratos to come to the "Castle of the Fates". 

In the wake of sidestepping traps and overcoming more adversaries, including the Kraken, Kratos experiences an inconspicuous adversary, uncovered to be a steadfast Spartan fighter likewise looking for the Sisters. Before he kicks the bucket, the warrior advises Kratos that Zeus has wrecked Sparta in Kratos' nonappearance. Shocked, Kratos is additionally propelled and liberates a phoenix, riding the animal to the Sisters' fortification where he defies two, Lakhesis and Atropos. After they decline his solicitation to change time, Kratos fights them. Amid this, the Sisters attempt to change the result of Kratos' fight with Ares, however Kratos executes them both, at that point stands up to the rest of the Sister, Clotho. He slaughters her utilizing her own snares, and secures the "Loom of Fate" so as to come back to the time when Zeus sold out him. 

Kratos shocks Zeus, catches the Blade of Olympus, lastly cripples him. Athena mediates and beseeches Kratos to stop, as by slaughtering Zeus, he will pulverize Olympus. Kratos disregards her and attempts to murder Zeus, yet Athena penances herself by spearing herself upon the cutting edge, conceding Zeus' departure. Before she bites the dust, Athena uncovers that Kratos is really Zeus' child. Zeus was apprehensive Kratos would usurp him, similarly as Zeus had usurped his very own dad, Cronos. Kratos announces that the standard of the divine beings is at an end, at that point goes back in time and protects the Titans just before their annihilation in the Great War. He comes back with the Titans to the present, and the divine beings watch as their previous adversaries climb Mount Olympus. Kratos, remaining on the back of Gaia, pronounces that he has brought the annihilation of Olympus, setting up the occasions of "Lord of War III". 

A continuation of "Lord of War" was first prodded toward the finish of its credits, which expressed, "Kratos Will Return".

Barlog guaranteed that the amusement would be playable on the more up to date stage, which had PlayStation 2 in reverse similarity.
