Charles Eaton, OBE, AFC (21Â December 1895Â â 12Â November 1979) was a senior officer and pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and later filled in as an ambassador. Conceived in London, he joined the British Army upon the flare-up of World WarÂ I and saw activity on the Western Front before exchanging to the Royal Flying Corps in 1917. Posted as an aircraft pilot to No.Â 206 Squadron, he was twice caught by German powers, and twice got away. Eaton left the military in 1920 and worked in India until moving to Australia in 1923. After two years he joined the RAAF, serving at first as an educator at No.Â 1 Flying Training School. Somewhere in the range of 1929 and 1931, he was picked to lead three undertakings to scan for lost airplane in Central Australia, increasing national consideration and procuring the Air Force Cross for his "energy and commitment to obligation". 

In 1939, on the eve of World War II, Eaton turned into the debut leader of No.Â 12 (General Purpose) Squadron at the recently settled RAAF Station Darwin in Northern Australia. He was advanced gathering skipper in 1940, and delegated an Officer of the Order of the British Empire the next year. In 1943, he took direction of No.Â 79 Wing at Batchelor, Northern Territory, and was referenced in despatches amid tasks in the South West Pacific. Resigning from the RAAF in December 1945, Eaton took up discretionary posts in the Dutch East Indies, heading a United Nations commission as Consul-General amid the Indonesian National Revolution. He came back to Australia in 1950, and served in Canberra for a further two years. Prominently known as "Moth" Eaton, he was a rancher in later life, and kicked the bucket in 1979 matured 83. He is remembered by a few commemorations in the Northern Territory. 

Charles Eaton was conceived on 21Â December 1895 in Lambeth, London, the child of William Walpole Eaton, a butcher, and his better half Grace. Educated in Wandsworth, Charles worked in Battersea Town Council from the age of fourteen, preceding joining the London Regiment upon the flare-up of World WarÂ I in August 1914. Appended to a bike organization in the 24th Battalion of the 47th Division, he touched base at the Western Front in March 1915. He participated in channel shelling missions and assaults on adversary lines of correspondence, seeing activity in the Battles of Aubers Ridge, Festubert, Loos, and the Somme. 

On 14Â May 1915, Eaton exchanged to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), experiencing introductory pilot preparing at Oxford. While he was getting his Maurice Farman Shorthorn toward the finish of his first solo flight, another understudy crashed into him and was executed, yet Eaton was healthy. He was appointed in August and was granted his wings in October. Positioned lieutenant, he presented with No.Â 110 Squadron, which worked Martinsyde G.100 "Elephant" warriors out of Sedgeford, shielding London against Zeppelin carriers. He was exchanged to the recently framed Royal Air Force (RAF) in April 1918, and presented the next month on France flying Airco DH.9 single-engined aircraft with No.Â 206 Squadron. On 29Â June, he was shot down behind adversary lines and caught in the region of Nieppe. Detained in Holzminden wartime captive camp, Germany, Eaton got away however was recovered and court-martialled, after which he was kept in isolation. He later affected another departure and prevailing with regards to rejoining his squadron in the last days of the war. 

Eaton stayed in the RAF after the war. He wedded Beatrice Godfrey in St. Thomas' congregation at Shepherd's Bush, London, on 11Â January 1919. Presented on No.Â 1 Squadron, he was a pilot on the primary standard traveler administration among London and Paris, shipping agents to and from the Peace Conference at Versailles. Eaton was sent to India in December to attempt flying study work, including the primary such review of the Himalayas. He left the RAF in July 1920, staying in India to take up work with the Imperial Forest Service. After effectively applying for a situation with the Queensland Forestry Service, he and his family relocated to Australia in 1923. Moving to South Yarra, Victoria, he enrolled as a flying officer in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at Laverton on 14Â August 1925. He was presented on No.Â 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Point Cook, as a flight educator, where he wound up known as an exacting slave driver and an effective mentor. Here Eaton procured his epithet of "Moth", the Air Force's fundamental mentor as of now being the De Havilland DH.60 Moth. Advanced flight lieutenant in February 1928, he flew a Moth in the 1929 East-West Air Race from Sydney to Perth, as a component of the festivals for the Western Australia Centenary; he was the 6th contender over the line, after individual RFC veteran Jerry Pentland. 

Viewed as one of the RAAF's most skilful crosscountry pilots and guides, Eaton came to open consideration as pioneer of three military endeavors to discover lost flying machine in Central Australia somewhere in the range of 1929 and 1931. In April 1929, he composed the Air Force's part in the scan for pilots Keith Anderson and Bob Hitchcock, missing in their airplane the "Kookaburra" while themselves searching for Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm, who had drive handled the "Southern Cross" in north Western Australia amid a departure from Sydney. Three of the RAAF's five veteran DH.9 biplanes went down in the pursuitâhowever all teams got away damageâincluding Eaton's, which experienced what he named "a great accident" on 21Â April close Tennant Creek after the motor's cylinders liquefied. That day, Captain Lester Brain, flying a Qantas air ship, found the disaster area of the "Kookaburra" in the Tanami Desert, roughly east-south-east of Wave Hill. Setting out from Wave Hill on 23Â April, Eaton drove a ground party crosswise over unpleasant territory that achieved the accident site four days after the fact and covered the group, who had died of thirst and presentation. Not an especially religious man, he reviewed that after the entombment he saw an ideal cross shaped by cirrus cloud in a generally clear blue sky over the "Kookaburra". The Air Board portrayed the RAAF's pursuit as taking 240 hours flying time "under the most attempting conditionsÂ ...Â where a constrained landing implied certain accident". In November 1930, Eaton was chosen to lead another campaign for a missing airplane close Ayers Rock, however it was canceled soon subsequently when the pilot appeared in Alice Springs. The following month, he was requested to look for W.L. Pittendrigh and S.J. Hamre, who had vanished in the biplane "Brilliant QuestÂ 2" while endeavoring to find Lasseter's Reef. Utilizing four DH.60 Moths, the RAAF group found the missing men close Dashwood Creek on 7Â January 1931, and they were saved four days after the fact by a ground party joined by Eaton. Remaining in close-by Alice Springs, he prescribed a site for the town's new landing strip, which was affirmed and has stayed being used since its development. 

Eaton was granted the Air Force Cross on 10Â March 1931 "in acknowledgment of his energy and dedication to obligation in leading flights to Central Australia looking for missing pilots". The media considered him the "'Knight Errant' of the desert skies". Beside his accident arrival in the desert while looking for the "Kookaburra", Eaton had another near disaster in 1929 when he was test flying the Wackett WarrigalÂ I with Sergeant Eric Douglas. Having intentionally put the biplane coach into a turn and finding no reaction in the controls when he attempted to recuperate, Eaton approached Douglas to rescue. At the point when Douglas faced do as such, the turn halted, clearly because of his middle changing the wind current over the tail plane. Eaton then figured out how to arrive the plane, he and his traveler both seriously shaken by the experience. In December 1931, he was presented on No.Â 1 Aircraft Depot at Laverton, where he kept on flying just as performing regulatory work. Advanced squadron pioneer in 1936, he attempted a covert mission around the new year to scout for appropriate landing grounds in the Dutch East Indies, essentially Timor and Ambon. Wearing regular citizen garments, he and his friend were captured and held for three days by neighborhood experts in Koepang, Dutch Timor. Eaton was named leader (CO) of No.Â 21 Squadron in May 1937, one of his first errands being to embrace another airborne hunt in Central Australia, this time for miner Sir Herbert Gepp, who was in this way found fit as a fiddle. Soon thereafter, Eaton managed the court of investigation into the accident of a Hawker Demon biplane in Victoria, suggesting a valor grant for Aircraftman William McAloney, who had jumped into the Demon's consuming destruction with an end goal to protect its pilot; McAloney in this manner got the Albert Medal for his courage. 

Following a 1937 choice to build up the primary north Australian RAAF base, in April 1938 Eaton, presently on the central station staff of RAAF Station Laverton, and Wing Commander George Jones, Director of Personnel Services at RAAF Headquarters, started creating plans for the new station, to be told by Jones, and another squadron that would be based there, driven by Eaton. The following month they flew an Avro Anson on an investigation voyage through Darwin, Northern Territory, site of the proposed base. Deferrals implied that No.Â 12 (General Purpose) Squadron was not framed until 6Â February 1939 at Laverton. Jones had at this point proceeded onward to another posting however Eaton took up the squadron's order as arranged. Elevated to wing authority on 1Â March, he and his hardware officer, Flying Officer Hocking, were requested to develop the unit as fast as would be prudent, and built up an underlying supplement of fourteen officers and 120 aviators, in addition to four Ansons and four Demons, inside seven days. A development gathering of thirty NCOs and aviators under Hocking started moving to Darwin on 1Â July. Staff were at first suited in a previous meatworks worked amid World WarÂ I, and life at the recently settled air base had a "particularly crude, spearheading feel about it" as indicated by student of history Chris Coulthard-Clark. Confidence, however, was high. On 31Â August, No.Â 12 Squadron propelled its first watch over the Darwin territory, flown by one of seven Ansons that had so far been conveyed. These were enlarged by a trip of four CAC Wirraways (supplanting the initially arranged power of Demons) that took off from Laverton on 2Â September, the day preceding Australia pronounced war, and touched base in Darwin four days after the fact. A fifth Wirraway in the flight slammed on arriving at Darwin, executing both crew members. 

When war was proclaimed, Darwin started to get more consideration from military organizers. In June 1940, No.Â 12 Squadron was "ripped apart" to frame two extra units, Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin and No.Â 13 Squadron. No.Â 12 Squadron held its Wirraway flight, while its two flights of Ansons went to the new squadron; these were supplanted soon thereafter by progressively competent Lockheed Hudsons. Eaton was selected CO of the base, picking up advancement to transitory gathering skipper in September. His squadrons were utilized in escort, oceanic observation, and waterfront watch obligations, the exhausted airplane being sent to RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, after at regular intervals flying timeâwith a resulting three-week misfortune from Darwin's qualityâas profound support was not yet conceivable in the Northern Territory. Not long after the foundation of Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin, Minister for Air James Fairbairn visited the base. Steering his own light plane, he was welcomed by four Wirraways that continued to escort him into getting; the Minister along these lines complimented Eaton on the "sharp ness and proficiency everything being equal", especially thinking about the difficult condition. At the point when Fairbairn kicked the bucket in the Canberra air catastrophe in no time a while later, his pilot was Flight Lieutenant Robert Hitchcock, child of Bob Hitchcock of the "Kookaburra" and furthermore a previous individual from Eaton's No.Â 21 Squadron. 

As senior air authority in the district, Eaton sat on the Darwin Defense Co-appointment Committee. He was sometimes at loggerheads with his maritime partner, Captain E.P. Thomas, and furthermore brought about the wrath of exchange unionists when he utilized RAAF staff to empty ships in Port Darwin amid mechanical move; Eaton himself participated in the work, scooping coal close by his men. On 25Â February 1941, he made a flight north to observe Timor, Ambon, and Babo in Dutch New Guinea for potential use by the RAAF in any Pacific clash. By April, the absolute quality based at RAAF Station Darwin had expanded to just about 700 officers and aviators; by the next month it had been increased by satellite landing strips at Bathurst Island, Groote Eylandt, Batchelor, and Katherine. Giving over order of Darwin to Group Captain Frederick Scherger in October, Eaton assumed responsibility for No.Â 2 Service Flying Training School close Wagga, New South Wales. His "checked achievement", "untiring vitality", and "politeness in taking care of men" while in the Northern Territory were perceived in the new year with his arrangement as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Eaton moved toward becoming CO of No.Â 1 Engineering School and its base, RAAF Station Ascot Vale, Victoria, in April 1942. After a year in Townsville, Queensland, he framed No.Â 72 Wing, which in this manner sent to Merauke in Dutch New Guinea, containing No.Â  84 Squadron (flying CAC Boomerang contenders), No.Â  86 Squadron (P-40 Kittyhawk warriors), and No.Â 12 Squadron (A-31 Vengeance plunge planes). His relations with North-Eastern Area Command in Townsville were stressed; "mountains were made out of molehills" as he would see it, and he was reassigned that July to lead No.Â 2 Bombing and Gunnery School in Port Pirie, South Australia. 

On 30Â November 1943, Eaton came back toward the Northern Territory to build up No.Â 79 Wing at Batchelor, containing No.Â 1 and No.Â 2 Squadrons (flying Bristol Beaufort light observation aircraft), No.Â 31 Squadron (Bristol Beaufighter long-extend contenders), and No.Â 18 (Netherlands East Indies) 

Squadron (B-25 Mitchell medium aircraft). He built up a decent association with his Dutch work force, who called him "Oom Charles" (Uncle Charles). Working under the support of North-Western Area Command (NWA), Darwin, Eaton's powers took an interest in the New Guinea and North-Western Area Campaigns amid 1944, in which he normally flew on missions himself. Through Marchâ April, his Beaufighters assaulted foe shipping, while the Mitchells and Beauforts besieged Timor regularly as a prelude to Operations Reckless and Persecution, the attacks of Hollandia and Aitape. On 19Â April, he sorted out a huge strike against Su, Dutch Timor, utilizing thirty-five Mitchells, Beauforts and Beaufighters to obliterate the town's sleeping shelter and fuel dumps, the outcomes winning him the individual congrats of the Air Officer Commanding NWA, Air Vice Marshal "Lord" Cole, for his "astonishing exertion". Upon the arrival of the Allied arrivals, 22Â April, the Mitchells and Beaufighters made a sunshine attack on Dili, Portuguese Timor. The ground strike met little resistance, attributed to some extent to the air assault in the days paving the way to it. In Juneâ July, No.Â 79 Wing bolstered the Allied assault on Noemfoor. Eaton was prescribed to be referenced in despatches on 28Â October 1944 for his "Courageous and recognized administration" in NWA; this was proclaimed in the "London Gazette" on 9Â March 1945. 

Finishing his visit with No.Â 79 Wing, Eaton was designated Air Officer Commanding Southern Area, Melbourne, in January 1945. The worked off southern Australia amid the main long periods of 1945, and the few battle units in Eaton's direction were vigorously occupied with against submarine watches which tried to find this and some other U-pontoons in the region. The Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, believed the sporadic assaults to be somewhat "annoyance esteem", intended to draw Allied assets from the bleeding edge of the South West Pacific war. In April, Eaton whined to Bostock that insight from British Pacific Fleet concerning its boats' developments eastwards out of Western Area was hours obsolete when it was gotten at Southern Area Command, prompting RAAF airplane missing their meeting and squandering profitable flying hours looking void sea. There had been no U-watercraft strikes since February, and by June the maritime specialists demonstrated that there was no squeezing requirement for air spread aside from the most imperative vessels. 

Eaton resigned from the RAAF on 31Â December 1945. In acknowledgment of his war administration, he was selected a Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau with Swords by the Dutch government on 17Â January 1946. That month, he ended up Australian diplomat in Dili. He had seen a commercial for the position and was the main candidate with experience of the zone. While based there, he went with the common senator on visits to townships harmed in Allied assaults amid the war, taking consideration to be vigilant about the part played by his very own powers from No.Â 79 Wing. In July 1947, Dutch powers propelled a "police activity" against region held by the juvenile Indonesian Republic, which had been proclaimed soon after the finish of the war. Following a truce, the United Nations set up a commission, led by Eaton as Consul-General, to screen advance. Eaton and his kindred officials trusted that the truce was serving the Dutch as a spread for further infiltration of republican enclaves. His solicitations to the Australian government for military eyewitnesses prompted sending of the primary peacekeeping power to the district; the Australians were before long pursued by British and US spectators, and empowered Eaton to show a progressively reasonable impression of the circumstance to the outside world. The Dutch organization unequivocally restricted the nearness of UN powers and blamed Eaton for "inappropriateness", however the Australian government wouldn't review him. Following the move of power in December 1949, he turned into Australia's first secretary and chargÃ© d'affaires to the Republic of the United States of Indonesia. In 1950, he came back to Australia to present with the Department of External Affairs in Canberra. In the wake of resigning from open administration in 1951, he and his significant other cultivated at Metung, Victoria, and developed orchids. They later moved to Frankston, where Eaton was engaged with special work. 

Charles Eaton kicked the bucket in Frankston on 12Â November 1979. Made due by his better half and two children, he was incinerated. As per his desires, his slag were dispersed close Tennant Creek, site of his 1929 constrained arriving amid the look for the "Kookaburra", from a RAAF Caribou on 15Â April 1981. His name figures unmistakably in the Northern Territory, where he is remembered by Lake Eaton in Central Australia, Eaton Place in the Darwin suburb of Karama, the suburb of Eaton that incorporates Darwin International Airport and RAAF Base Darwin, Charles Eaton Drive on the way to deal with Darwin International Airport, and the Charles Moth Eaton Saloon Bar in the Tennant Creek Goldfields Hotel. He is additionally regarded with a showcase at the Northern Territory Parliament, and a National Trust remembrance at Tennant Creek Airport. At the RAAF's 2003 History Conference, Air Commodore Mark Lax, reviewing Eaton's inquiry and-salvage missions between the wars, remarked:
