Following a 24-hour trip into Auckland, lead artist Bono was unfit to conform to the time distinction between New Zealand and Europe. He left his lodging amid the night and met a few people who indicated him around the city. Greg Carroll was a piece of that gathering: he had met U2's generation chief Steve Iredale and been offered work helping the band for their forthcoming show by virtue of Greg's involvement with nearby musical crews. They wound up taking Bono up One Tree Hill (Maungakiekie), one of the most noteworthy â and all the more profoundly huge to MÄori individuals â of Auckland's biggest volcanoes. Greg functioned as a phase hand delicately ceasing individuals jumping in front of an audience, and was portrayed as "this exceptionally supportive fellah going around the spot". U2's supervisor Paul McGuinness thought Carroll was helpful to the point that he ought to go with the band for the rest of the visit. The gathering helped him get an international ID, and he in this manner went along with them out and about in Australia and the United States as their partner. He turned out to be exceptionally dear companions with Bono and his better half Ali Hewson, and following the finish of the visit, he worked for U2 in Dublin. 

On 3 July 1986, just before the beginning of the chronicle sessions for "The Joshua Tree", Carroll was murdered in a bike mishap while on a dispatch run. A vehicle had pulled before him, and unfit to stop in the downpour, Carroll struck the side of the vehicle and was murdered immediately. The occasion stunned the whole band; drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. stated, "his passing truly shaken us â it was the first occasion when anybody in our working circle had been slaughtered." Guitarist the Edge stated, "Greg resembled an individual from the family, however the way that he had gone under our wing and had voyage so distant from home to be in Dublin to work with us made it even more hard to manage." Bassist Adam Clayton depicted it as "a calming minute", saying, "it propelled the mindfulness that there are more critical things than shake 'n' roll. That your family, your companions and for sure different individuals from the band â you don't have the foggiest idea how much time you have left with them." Bono stated, "it was a staggering blow. He was helping me out. He was taking my bicycle home." He later remarked, "it conveyed gravitas to the account of "The Joshua Tree". We needed to fill the opening in our heart with something extremely, substantial to be sure, we adored him such a great amount of." Accompanied by Bono, Ali, Mullen, and different individuals from the U2 association, Carroll's body was flown back to New Zealand and covered in the customary MÄori way at Kai-iwi Marae close Whanganui, Carroll's main residence. Bono sang "Let It Be" and "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" for him at the burial service.

The music was grown from the get-go in the chronicle sessions for "The Joshua Tree". The Edge stated, "We were sticking with Brian [Eno]. He was playing consoles ... we just got this score moving, and this part started to come through. It's nearly highlife, in spite of the fact that it's not African at all ... the sound was for me around then an exceptionally intricate one. I could never have longed for utilizing a sound like that before at that point, yet it just felt right, and I ran with it." Bono recorded his vocals in a solitary take, as he felt that he couldn't sing the verses a second time. The Edge utilized a Bond Electraglide guitar to play a performance with an "overwhelming fluff" sound toward the finish of the melody. Three artists from TorontoâDick, Paul and Adele Arminârecorded string pieces for the melody in Grant Avenue Studio in Hamilton, Ontario. In a six-hour telephone call with the Edge, and under the supervision of maker Daniel Lanois, the Armins utilized "complex 'electro-acoustic' string instrument[s]" they created called Raads to record a piece made for the tune. Dick Armin stated, "[U2] were keen on utilizing strings, yet not in the traditional style of improving. They didn't need a nineteenth century gather playing behind them." Bono found the melody so enthusiastic, he was unfit to hear it out after it had been recorded. 

In the melody, Bono incorporated the verse: "Jara sang, his tune a weapon in the hands of adoration/You realize his blood still cries from the beginning". This alludes to the Chilean political dissident and society vocalist VÃ­ctor Jara, who turned into an image of the obstruction against the Augusto Pinochet military fascism after he was tormented and slaughtered amid the 1973 Chilean overthrow. Bono scholarly of Jara in the wake of meeting RenÃ© Castro, a Chilean wall painting craftsman, while on Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope visit. Castro had been tormented and held in an inhumane imprisonment for a long time by the military since his craftsmanship scrutinized the Pinochet-drove routine that had caught control in 1973 amid the overthrow. While acquiring a silkscreen of Martin Luther King, Jr. that Castro had made, Bono saw a print of Jara. He turned out to be progressively acquainted with him in the wake of perusing "Una CanciÃ³n Truncada" (An Unfinished Song), composed by Jara's widow Joan Turner. 

"One Tree Hill" and "The Joshua Tree" are committed to Carroll's memory. The track was recorded by Flood and Pat McCarthy, blended by Dave Meegan, and delivered by Lanois and Eno.
