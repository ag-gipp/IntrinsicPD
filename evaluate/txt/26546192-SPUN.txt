Colin Covert of the "Star Tribune" considered it a "frequenting, painstakingly created film" with basic "obvious reality" heading, a "trim and proficient" screenplay, solid acting and strong characters. Clandestine stated, "This is one of not many American movies to manage religious convictions about confidence and salvation with compassion and knowledge."

He likewise applauded the snapshots of lighthearted element with Sisto and Baumgartner, which he said complimented a portion of the film's heavier minutes. L. Kent Wolgamott of the "Lincoln Journal Star" called "Into Temptation" a well-made film that "gets the temperament directly all the way". He complimented the exhibitions and said in spite of the fact that sex entertainment and prostitution were recognizable film points, "the film's nuanced comprehension of the cleric and his tangled job in attempting to spare Linda adds another component to the old story." 

Bounce Fischbach of the "Omaha World-Herald" called the cinematography sharp, the altering fresh, and the acting "consistently great".

All through the film, Father John is cautioned that his job as a minister accompanies limits, and that he ought not become by and by included with the gatherers or attempt to tackle their issues aside from through directing. Be that as it may, Father John starts to scrutinize those limits and rethink whether the job as minister goes sufficiently far in having a positive, substantive effect on the lives of those in his consideration, especially Linda. What's more, notwithstanding addressing whether he is helping his gatherers, Father John addresses in the case of remaining inside those limits is sufficient to by and by satisfy himself as a minister and give his very own life meaning. He at last traverses those limits and gets actually associated with endeavoring to help Linda by diving into the city's seedy area of town to look for her. 

The film takes an advanced, liberal way to deal with the tenets and requirements of Catholicism. Indeed, even before Father John chooses to help Linda, he is scrutinizing the requirements of his religion and calling. While addressing an imminent mother battling about whether to bring up her girl inside the exacting limits of Catholicism, Father John gives her recommendation past the official doctrine and urges her to be adaptable, revealing to her she should "take what works" from the congregation lessons. Father John additionally has an unconventional perspective on homosexuality contrasted with the ordinary perspectives on the congregation. This is exhibited in a scene in which the cleric comforts a young fellow who is battling with his gay sentiments. In meeting and cooperating with the pimps and whores of the seedy area of town, "Into Temptation" obscures the lines among great and malicious, and among good and bad. The negative reactions Father John experiences from believers and the congregation in regards to his treks to the shady area of town show the manner in which sex and destitution are frequently trashed in the public eye. 

As the title proposes, one of the significant topics of the film includes the enticements Father John appearances to sin and stray from his clerical calling.

This is additionally showed through the abrupt return of his previous sweetheart, for whom Father John confesses to in any case harboring sentimental emotions. The cleric shows clashing feelings with regards to keeping up his holy pledges and his association with Nadine. 

"Into Temptation" is additionally an account of recovery, both for Linda, who is looking for reclamation for a real existence of transgression and prostitution, and for Father John, who is looking for recovery for his inability to help Linda and his very own questions about religion and organization. Toward the beginning of the film, Father John has all the earmarks of being scrutinizing his obligation to the congregation and its lessening assembly; this is particularly shown when he seems exhausted amid admission and does crossword riddles to hang loose. Such battles are normal in brotherhood. Be that as it may, after he opposes the congregation limits and endeavors to help Linda, his confidence in the assembly and faith in the calling are reestablished, and he comes back to the congregation a more grounded and progressively content cleric. The film exhibits the intensity of sympathy and individual consideration, especially in the manner in which that John's straightforward demonstration of guarding Linda amid her adolescence was such a significant minute in her life. The film likewise advocates atonement, and the degree of Linda's exploitation can be deciphered as an indication of how calamitous an unrepentant life can be.
