In 1936, at age 18, Tucker marked as an expert with the Fayetteville Bears of the Arkansasâ Missouri League, yet left the group after just two weeks, without playing an amusement. Before long, he was marked by the Siloam Springs Travelers of a similar group, where he started his expert vocation. 

In 1936, his first season with the Travelers, Tucker changed handling positions and turned into an outfielder. In 117 diversions, he had a .319 batting normal and 25 copies.

Exhaust's leap forward small time year came in 1940, his second with Clarksdale. Before the finish of June, he was driving the Cotton State League with a batting normal of .374. In the wake of playing in 97 amusements, completing with a normal of .390, Tucker was advanced and played in 40 recreations for the Oklahoma City Indians. Toward the finish of the period, Chicago White Sox ranch director Billy Webb was sufficiently awed to buy Tucker's agreement from Oklahoma City.

Amid spring preparing, director Jimmy Dykes was inspired by Tucker, who was going after the beginning focus defender position close by Moose Solters. Thus, subsequent to spring preparing Tucker turned into the beginning focus defender for 1943, and the group's leadoff hitter. Mostly through the season, Tucker's execution grabbed the attention of American League President Will Harridge, who noted him as somebody the open turned out to watch without stars serving in World War II. Among Tucker's accomplishments amid it were a stroll off grand slam on July 26 to win a diversion against the New York Yankees 2â 1. Exhaust completed the season with a .235 batting normal, six triples, and 79 strolls in 135 diversions.

Exhaust hit great amid the primary month of 1944; he had a .403 batting normal on May 16, which drove the American League. His hitting and handling capacities inspired pundits: sportswriter Fred Lieb noted him as a breakout entertainer that year, and supervisor Jimmy Dykes considered Tucker the best cautious outfielder in the American League. Exhaust and Dixie Walker drove their separate groups in batting normal all through June; toward the month's end, Tucker had a normal of .369 in the American League while Walker had a normal of .377 in the National League. Attributable to his accomplishments, Tucker was added to the 1944 All-Star program for the main time in his profession.

Toward the finish of July that season, both Tucker and George Case took an interest in a 75-yard dash as a major aspect of the White Sox's yearly advantage for the war exertion; Tucker lost the race to Case by a yard. After the season finished, Tucker formally joined the Navy, and spent the 1945 season serving in the war. 

At the point when the players came back to their groups toward the finish of the war, Tucker was slated to be the beginning focus defender for the 1946 season, working close by Wally Moses and Taffy Wright. In contrast to the past season, he battled with the bat at first, and was consigned to his unique status on the White Sox program as a decent defender yet a poor hitter. Toward the finish of June, Tucker had a batting normal of .229, almost 150 points lower than his normal at a similar point in 1944. His structure recuperated in the second 50% of the period and he completed the year with a batting normal of .288 and 20 pairs, both vocation highs. As the 1947 Chicago White Sox season started, Tucker stayed in his inside field position subsequent to hitting .400 in the most recent month of the 1946 season, while new kid on the block Dave Philley played in left field and Taffy Wright and Bob Kennedy platooned in right field. In any case, he began the year by missing some playing time because of a stomach illness, and did not play routinely for the White Sox until the center of May.

He was consigned for the most part to substituting obligations, and completed the season with a .244 batting normal in 20 amusements and under 200 at-bats. Because of his hitting battles, Indians administrator Lou Boudreau had a go at changing over Tucker to a change hitter to begin off the 1950 season. Exhaust was again set to be a reinforcement outfielder in 1950. His exhibitions amid the year included hitting a grand slam, the just a single he hit that season, in a 8â 5 triumph over the Brooklyn Dodgers; the groups brought $60,000 up in that diversion to profit sandlot groups in Cleveland. Exhaust completed the season with a .178 batting normal in 54 diversions, the most minimal characteristic of his profession.
