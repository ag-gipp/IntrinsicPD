This execution tied the NFL record for most misfortunes in a solitary season and it broke the record held by the winless 1976 Buccaneers for most continuous misfortunes in a solitary season (the two records have since been broken by the 2008 Lions), driving the Panthers to flame Seifert. 

After the NFL's development to 32 groups in 2002, the Panthers were migrated from the NFC West to the recently made NFC South division. The Panthers' competitions with the Falcons and Saints were kept up, and they would be joined by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. New York Giants cautious facilitator John Fox was procured to supplant Seifert and drove the group to a completion in 2002. In spite of the fact that the group's protection surrendered not very many yards, positioning the second-best in the NFL in yards yielded, they were ruined by an offense that positioned as the second-most noticeably bad in the association in yards picked up.

The every single dark uniform won the "Best Uniform in NFL History" challenge, a fan-casted a ballot challenge kept running by NFL.com in July 2013. In July 2013, the group's hardware chief, Jackie Miles, said the Panthers planned to utilize the all-dark uniform more later on. The Panthers wore the all-dark uniform multiple times the accompanying season, when each in the preseason and ordinary season, and the third time amid the home divisional round playoff diversion versus the 49ers. Amid the Panthers' 2015 Thanksgiving Day diversion against the Dallas Cowboys, they appeared an all-blue uniform as a major aspect of Nike's "Shading Rush" arrangement. 

In the 2018 show season, the Panthers wore the dark jeans with the blue shirts for a home diversion versus the New England Patriots, at that point combined the dark jeans with the white shirts in an away amusement versus the Pittsburgh Steelers. Amid the 2018 season, the group did not wear silver jeans. Rather they wore every single dark uniform and blue shirts with white jeans.
