Hydnum repandum 

Hydnum repandum, normally known as the sweet tooth, wood hedgehog or hedgehog mushroom, is a basidiomycete parasite of the family Hydnaceae. First portrayed via Carl Linnaeus in 1753, it is the sort types of the family "Hydnum". The organism produces natural product bodies (mushrooms) that are portrayed by their spore-bearing structuresâas spines as opposed to gillsâwhich hang down from the underside of the top. The top is dry, shaded yellow to light orange to dark colored, and regularly builds up an unpredictable shape, particularly when it has become firmly swarmed with adjoining natural product bodies. The mushroom tissue is white with a charming smell and a fiery or harsh taste. All pieces of the mushroom recolor orange with age or when wounded. 

A mycorrhizal growth, "Hydnum repandum" is comprehensively dispersed in Europe, Asia and western North America, where it natural products independently or in close gatherings in coniferous or deciduous forest. This is a decision palatable animal types, albeit develop examples can build up a harsh taste. It has no toxic carbon copies. Mushrooms are gathered and sold in neighborhood markets of Europe and Canada. 

First formally portrayed via Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 "Species Plantarum", "Hydnum repandum" was endorsed by Swedish mycologist Elias Fries in 1821. The species has been rearranged to a few genera: "Hypothele" by French naturalist Jean-Jacques Paulet in 1812; "Dentinum" by British botanist Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821; "Tyrodon" by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten in 1881; "Sarcodon" by French naturalist Lucien QuÃ©let in 1886. After a 1977 nomenclatural proposition by American mycologist Ronald H. Petersen was acknowledged, "Hydnum repandum" turned into the official sort types of the class "Hydnum". Beforehand, supporting contentions for making "H.Â repandum" the sort were made by Dutch taxonomist Marinus Anton Donk (1958) and Petersen (1973), while Czech mycologist ZdenÄk Pouzar (1958) and Canadian mycologist Kenneth Harrison (1971) suspected that "H.Â imbricatum" ought to be the sort. 

A few structures and assortments of "H.Â repandum" have been depicted. Structures "albidum" and "rufescens", found in Russia, were distributed by T.L. Nikolajeva in 1961; the last taxon is synonymous with "H.Â rufescens". Structure "amarum", distributed from Slovenia by Zlata Stropnik, Bogdan Tratnik and Garbrijel Seljak in 1988, is ill-conceived according to article 36.1 of the International Code of Nomenclature for green growth, organisms, and plants, as it was not given an adequately thorough depiction. French botanist Jean-Baptiste Barla portrayed "H.Â repandum" var. "rufescens" in 1859. English naturalist Carleton Rea depicted the white-organic product bodied form as an assortmentâ"H.Â repandum" var. "collection"â in 1922. 

Sub-atomic examinations have demonstrated that the present species idea for "H.Â repandum" required update as there was a poor cover among morphological and sub-atomic species ideas. A 2009 Phylogenetic examination of European examples, in light of inward deciphered spacer and 5.8S DNA arrangements, showed that "H.Â repandum" examples structure two particular clades, whose just steady morphological qualification is top size. These hereditary contrasts foreshadowed the nearness of undescribed enigmatic species, and that the taxon may right now experience escalated speciation. A thorough hereditary examination distributed in 2016 of individuals from the variety overall found that there are somewhere around four species in the wide idea of "H.Â repandum": two species from southern China, one from Europe and eastern North America, and "H.Â repandum" itself from Europe, western North America, and northern (and snow capped southwestern) China and Japan. Despite the fact that it is absent from Central America, hereditary material has been recuperated from Venezuela from the tree "Pakaraimaea dipterocarpacea", proposing it by one way or another relocated there and had changed hosts. 

The particular designation "repandum" signifies "twisted back", alluding to the wavy top edge. The varietal sobriquet "collection" signifies "white as an egg". "Hydnum repandum" has been given a few vernacular names: "sweet tooth", "yellow tooth parasite", "wood urchin", "spreading hedgehog", "hedgehog mushroom", or "pig's trotter". The assortment "collection" is known as "white wood". 

The orange-, yellow-or tan-shaded pileus (top) is up to wide, despite the fact that examples estimating have been reported. It is commonly fairly unpredictable fit as a fiddle (it might be arched or curved at development), with a wavy edge that is rolled internal when youthful. Tops develop in a mutilated shape when organic product bodies are firmly grouped. The top surface is commonly dry and smooth, albeit develop examples may indicate splitting. Seen from over, the tops of develop examples look like fairly those of chanterelles. The tissue is thick, white, firm, fragile, and wounds yellow to orange-dark colored. The underside is thickly secured with little, thin whitish spines estimating long. These spines at times rundown something like one side of the stipe. The stipe, normally long and thick, is either white or a similar shading as the top, and is now and then askew. It is not entirely obvious the mushrooms when they are arranged among gilled mushrooms and boletes, in light of the fact that the top and stipe are genuinely unexceptional and the mushrooms must be swung over to uncover their spines. The unadulterated white assortment of this species, "H.Â repandum" var. "collection", is littler than the primary assortment, with a top estimating wide and a stipe that is long. 

The spore print is pale cream. Spores are smooth, slim walled and hyaline (translucent), generally circular to extensively egg-molded, and measure 5.5â 7.5 by 4.5â 5.5Â Âµm. They as a rule contain a solitary, vast refractive oil bead. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-formed, four-spored, and measure 30â 45 by 6â 10Â Âµm. The top fingernail skin is a trichodermium (where the peripheral hyphae develop generally parallel, similar to hairs, opposite to the top surface) of restricted, club-molded cells that are 2.5â 4Â Âµm wide. Underneath this tissue is the subhymenial layer of interlaced hyphae estimating 10â 20Â Âµm in distance across. The spine tissue is made of limited (2â 5Â Âµm measurement), dainty walled hyphae with clip associations. 

North American carbon copies incorporate the white hedgehog ("Hydnum albidum") and the goliath hedgehog ("Hydnum albomagnum"). "H.Â albidum" has a white to pale yellowish dim organic product body that wounds yellow to orange. "H.Â albomagnum" is huge and paler than "H.Â repandum". "Hydnum umbilicatum" is littler, with tops estimating in width, and more slender stipes that are wide. Its tops are umbilicate (with a navel-like hole), some of the time with an opening in the focal point of the top, not at all like the smoothed or somewhat discouraged tops of "H.Â repandum". Infinitesimally, "H.Â umbilicatum" has spores that are bigger and more circular than those of "H.Â repandum", estimating 7.5â 9 by 6â 7.5Â Âµm. An European twin, "Hydnum rufescens", is additionally littler than "H.Â repandum", and has a more profound apricot to orange shading. "Hydnum ellipsosporum", depicted as another species from Germany in 2004, contrasts from "H.Â repandum" by the shape and length of its spores, which are ellipsoid and measure 9â 11 by 6â 7.5Â Âµm. Contrasted with "H.Â repandum", it has littler organic product bodies, with top widths going from wide. 

"H. repandum" is a mycorrhizal organism. The natural product bodies develop independently, dispersed, or in gatherings on the ground or in leaf litter in both coniferous and deciduous timberlands. They can likewise develop in pixie rings. Fruiting happens from summer to pre-winter. The species is broadly dispersed in the northern mild zone, and is a standout amongst the most widely recognized of the tooth organisms. It has been recorded from Australia, Europe, northern Asia, and North America. In Europe, it has been recorded as a helpless animal varieties in the Red Data Lists of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany; Sweden records it as being of Least Concern. 

"H. repandum" is viewed as a decent eatable, having a sweet, nutty taste and a crunchy surface. Some think of it as what could be compared to the chanterelle. Creator Michael Kuo gives it an edibility rating of "extraordinary" and noticed that there are no toxic carbon copies, and that "H.Â repandum" mushrooms are probably not going to be swarmed with slimy parasites. Carefully brushing the top and stipe of examples following harvest will help keep soil from getting held up between the teeth. "H. repandum" mushrooms can be cooked by pickling, stewing in milk or stock, and sautÃ©eing, which makes a "delicate, substantial surface and a gentle flavor." The mushroom tissue retains fluids well and expect the kinds of included fixings. The firm surface of the cooked mushroom makes it appropriate for solidifying. Its regular flavor is allegedly like the peppery taste of watercress, or clams. More established examples may have an unpleasant taste, yet bubbling can expel the sharpness. Examples found under conifers can taste "obnoxiously solid". The structure "amarum", locally regular in Slovakia, is supposedly unappetizing in light of the fact that its organic product body has a severe taste at all formative stages. 

"Hydnum repandum" is much of the time sold with chanterelles in Italy, and in France, it is one of the formally perceived palatable species sold in business sectors. In Europe, it is typically sold under its French name "Pied-de-Mouton" (Sheep's Foot). It is likewise gathered and sold in neighborhood markets of Mexico, Spain and British Columbia, Canada. "H.Â repandum" mushrooms are additionally utilized as a nourishment source by the red squirrel ("Sciurus vulgaris"). 

As an across the board palatable species, "H. repandum" has been the subject of a few logical investigations deciding its dietary and concoction structure. "H.Â repandum" organic product bodies contain 10.7% dampness and 9.2% fiery remains. The natural corrosive structure incorporates malic corrosive (0.31 grams per 100Â g of mushroom, dry weight) and citrus extract (0.65%). One examination evaluated the extent of basic amino acids (esteem communicated as a level of the all out amino acids): valine, 3.9%; leucine, 14.5%; isoleucine, 3.2%; threonine, 4.4%; methionine, 1%; lysine, 4.2%; phenylalanine, 3.4%; tryptophan, 1.4%. Lipid content is 4.7% (communicated as a percent of dry issue). Significant unsaturated fats incorporate palmitate (15.7%), stearate (0.9%), oleate (26.4%), lineoleate (47.5%), and linolenate (20.3%). The mycosterol content has been recorded as 628 milligrams of ergosterol and 85Â mg of fungisterol (the two qualities for every 100 grams of dry issue). 

Both "H.Â repandum" and the assortment "collection" contain the diepoxide compound repandiol (2"R",3"R",8"R",9"R")- 4,6-decadiyne-2,3:8,9-diepoxy-1,10-diol), which was appeared to have intense cytotoxic movement against different tumor cells in lab culture. At the atomic dimension, repandiol is an alkylating operator. It embeds crosslinks between strands of DNA, making it troublesome for the hereditary material to be communicated or repeated. The unstable synthetic concoctions in charge of the fruity fragrance of the mushroom are known. The 12 mixes incorporate eight-carbon subsidiaries, for example, 1-octen-3-ol, ("E")- 2-octenol, and ("E")- 1,3-octadiene. European investigations directed after the 1986 Chernobyl calamity have demonstrated that the natural product bodies have a high rate of amassing of the radioactive isotope cesium.
