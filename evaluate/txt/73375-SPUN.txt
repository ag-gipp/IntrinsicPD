Lady of the hour of Frankenstein 

The Bride of Frankenstein is a 1935 American sci-fi blood and gore movie, the main continuation of Universal Pictures' 1931 hit "Frankenstein". It is viewed as one of only a handful couple of spin-offs of an incredible film that is far and away superior to the first film on which it is based. Similarly as with the main movie, "Lady of the hour of Frankenstein" was coordinated by James Whale and stars Boris Karloff as the Monster. The continuation highlights Elsa Lanchester in the double job of Mary Shelley and the Monster's mate toward the finish of the film. Colin Clive repeats his job as Henry Frankenstein, and Ernest Thesiger assumes the job of Doctor Septimus Pretorius. 

The motion picture begins as a prompt continuation of the occasions that finished up the before film, and is established in a subplot of the first Mary Shelley tale, "Frankenstein" (1818). In the film, a berated Henry Frankenstein relinquishes his arrangements to make life, just to be enticed lastly pressured by his old tutor Dr. Pretorius, alongside dangers from the Monster, into developing a mate for the Monster. 

The arrangement to film the continuation started not long after the debut of the principal film, however content issues postponed the undertaking. Primary photography started in January 1935, with inventive faculty from the first returning before and behind the camera. "Lady of the hour of Frankenstein" was discharged to basic and mainstream approval, despite the fact that it experienced challenges with some state and national control sheets. Since its discharge the film's notoriety has developed, and it has been hailed as Whale's perfect work of art. In 1998, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry, having been esteemed "socially, truly or stylishly critical". 

On a stormy night, Percy Bysshe Shelley (Douglas Walton) and Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon) acclaim Mary Shelley (Elsa Lanchester) for her account of Frankenstein and his Monster. Advising them that her goal was to grant an ethical exercise, Mary says she has a greater amount of the story to tell. The scene movements as far as possible of the 1931 "Frankenstein", in 1899. 

Townspeople accumulated around the consuming windmill cheer the clear passing of the Monster (Boris Karloff). Their bliss is tempered by the acknowledgment that Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is likewise clearly dead. Hans (Reginald Barlow), father of the young lady the animal suffocated in the past film, needs to see the Monster's bones. He falls into an overwhelmed pit underneath the plant, where the MonsterÂ â having endure the fireÂ â chokes him. Pulling himself from the pit, the Monster throws Hans' better half (Mary Gordon) to her demise. He next experiences Minnie (Una O'Connor), who escapes in fear. 

Henry's body is come back to his life partner Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson) at his familial mansion home. Minnie lands to sound the caution about the Monster, yet her notice goes unnoticed. Elizabeth, seeing Henry move, acknowledges he is as yet alive. Breast fed back to wellbeing by Elizabeth, Henry has revoked his creation, yet trusts he might be bound to open the mystery of life and interminability. A crazy Elizabeth cries that she sees demise coming, portending the landing of Henry's previous tutor, Doctor Septimus Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger). In his rooms, Pretorius indicates Henry a few homunculi he has made, including a smaller than usual ruler, lord, ecclesiastical overseer, fallen angel, ballet performer, and mermaid. Pretorius wishes to work with Henry to make a mate for the Monster and offers a toast to their endeavor: "To another universe of divine beings and beasts!" Upon driving Henry to support him, Pretorius will grow a fake mind while Henry assembles the parts for the mate. 

The Monster spares a youthful shepherdess (Anne Darling) from suffocating. Her shouts after observing him ready two seekers, who shoot and harm the animal. The seekers raise a horde that sets out in interest. Caught and trussed to a post, the Monster is pulled to a prison and tied. Taken off alone, he breaks his chains, slaughters the gatekeepers and departures into the forested areas. 

That night, the Monster experiences a tramp family and consumes his submit their open air fire. Following the sound of a violin playing "Ave Maria", the Monster experiences an old visually impaired recluse (O. P. Heggie) who says thanks to God for sending him a companion. He trains the beast words like "companion" and "great" and offers a supper with him. Two lost seekers unearth the bungalow and perceive the Monster. He assaults them and incidentally torches the cabin as the seekers lead the loner away. 

Taking shelter from another irate crowd in a sepulcher, the Monster spies Pretorius and his comrades Karl (Dwight Frye) and Ludwig (Ted Billings) tearing open a grave. The partners in crime leave as Pretorius remains to appreciate a light dinner. The Monster approaches Pretorius, and discovers that Pretorius plans to make a mate for him. 

Henry and Elizabeth, presently wedded, are visited by Pretorius. He is prepared for Henry to do his part in their "incomparable cooperation". Henry cannot and Pretorius brings in the Monster who requests Henry's assistance. Henry again cannot and Pretorius orders the Monster out, subtly flagging him to abduct Elizabeth. Pretorius promises her protected return upon Henry's investment. Henry comes back to his pinnacle research facility where regardless of himself he develops energized over his work. In the wake of being guaranteed of Elizabeth's security, Henry finishes the Bride's body. 

A tempest seethes as conclusive arrangements are made to breath life into the Bride. Her gauze wrapped body is raised through the rooftop. Lightning strikes a kite, sending power through the Bride. Henry and Pretorius bring down her and understand their prosperity. "She's alive! Alive!" Henry cries. They evacuate her swathes and help her to stand. "The lady of the hour of Frankenstein!" Doctor Pretorius pronounces. 

The Monster descends the means in the wake of executing Karl on the housetop and sees his mate (Elsa Lanchester). The energized Monster connects with her, asking, "Companion?" The Bride, shouting, rejects him. "She detest me! Like others" the Monster dejectedly says. As Elizabeth races to Henry's side, the Monster frenzies through the research facility. The Monster tells Henry and Elizabeth "Yes! Go! You live!" To Pretorius and the Bride, he says "You remain. We have a place dead." While Henry and Elizabeth escape, the Monster sheds a tear and destroys a switch to trigger the obliteration of the research facility and tower. 

General considered making a continuation of "Frankenstein" as right on time as its 1931 review screenings, following which the film's unique completion was changed to take into consideration Henry Frankenstein's survival. James Whale at first would not immediate "Lady of the hour", trusting he had "crushed the thought dry" on the principal film. Following the accomplishment of Whale's "The Invisible Man", maker Carl Laemmle, Jr. understood that Whale was the main conceivable chief for "Lady of the hour"; Whale exploited the circumstance in influencing the studio to give him a chance to make "One More River". Whale trusted the spin-off would not top the first, so he chose rather to make it a paramount "hoot". As per a studio marketing specialist, Whale and Universal's studio therapist chose "the Monster would have the psychological age of a ten-year old kid and the enthusiastic age of a chap of fifteen". 

Screenwriter Robert Florey composed a treatment entitled "The New Adventures of FrankensteinÂ âThe Monster Lives!", yet it was rejected without remark from the get-go in 1932. General staff author Tom Reed composed a treatment under the title "The Return of Frankenstein", a title held until recording started. Following its acknowledgment in 1933, Reed composed a full content that was submitted to the Hays office for audit. The content passed its survey, however Whale, who by then had been contracted to coordinate, whined that "it stinks to paradise". L. G. Blochman and Philip MacDonald were the following scholars relegated, yet Whale additionally found their work unacceptable. In 1934, Whale set John L. Balderston to take a shot at one more form, and it was he who come back to an occurrence from the novel in which the animal requests a mate. In the novel Frankenstein makes a mate, yet obliterates it without breathing life into it. Balderston additionally made the Mary Shelley preface. Following a while Whale was as yet not happy with Balderston's work and gave the task to dramatist William J. Hurlbut and Edmund Pearson. The last content, joining components of some of these forms, was submitted for Hays office survey in November 1934. Kim Newman reports that Whale intended to make Elizabeth the heart giver for the lady of the hour, however film history specialist Scott MacQueen states that Whale never had such an aim. 

Sources report that Bela Lugosi and Claude Rains were considered, with fluctuating degrees of reality, for the job of Frankenstein's guide, Pretorius; others report that the job was made explicitly for Ernest Thesiger. Due to Mae Clarke's evil wellbeing, Valerie Hobson supplanted her as Henry Frankenstein's adoration intrigue, Elizabeth. Right off the bat underway, Whale chose that a similar on-screen character cast to play the Bride ought to likewise play Mary Shelley in the film's introduction, to speak to how the storyÂ âand repulsiveness in generalÂ âsprings from the clouded side of the creative ability. He considered Brigitte Helm and Phyllis Brooks before settling on Elsa Lanchester. Lanchester, who had went with spouse Charles Laughton to Hollywood, had met with just moderate achievement while Laughton had a solid effect with a few movies including "The Private Life of Henry VIII" (for which he had won an Oscar) and Whale's own "The Old Dark House". Lanchester had returned alone to London when Whale reached her to offer her the double job. Lanchester displayed the Bride's murmuring on the murmuring of swans. She gave herself a sore throat while taping the murmuring succession, which Whale shot from various edges. 

Colin Clive and Boris Karloff repeated their jobs from "Frankenstein" as maker and creation, separately. Hobson reviewed Clive's liquor abuse had exacerbated since shooting the first, however Whale did not recast the job since his "insane quality" was vital for the film. Karloff unequivocally protested the choice to enable the Monster to talk. "Discourse! Idiotic! My contention was that if the beast had any effect or appeal, it was on the grounds that he was inarticulateÂ â this extraordinary, blundering, garbled animal. The minute he talked you may as wellÂ ... play it straight." This choice additionally implied that Karloff couldn't expel his dental plate, so now his cheeks did not have the depressed look of the first film. Whale and the studio therapist chose 44 basic words for the Monster's vocabulary by seeing test papers of ten-year-olds working at the studio. Dwight Frye came back to play the specialist's colleague, Karl, having played the hunchback Fritz in the first. Frye additionally recorded a scene as an anonymous resident and the job of "Nephew Glutz", a man who killed his uncle and accused the demise for the Monster. Boris Karloff is acknowledged basically as KARLOFF, which was Universal's custom amid the tallness of his profession. Elsa Lanchester is credited for Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, yet in a gesture to the prior film, the Monster's lady of the hour is acknowledged just as "?" similarly as Boris Karloff had been in the opening credits of "Frankenstein". 

All inclusive cosmetics craftsman Jack Pierce gave uncommon consideration to the Monster's appearance in this film. He adjusted his 1931 plan to show the delayed consequences of the factory fire, including scars and shortening the Monster's hair. Through the span of shooting, Pierce altered the Monster's cosmetics to demonstrate that the Monster's wounds were recuperating as the film advanced. Penetrate co-made the Bride's cosmetics with solid contribution from Whale, particularly in regards to the Bride's notorious haircut, in view of Nefertiti. Lanchester's hair was given a Marcel wave over a wire casing to accomplish the style. Lanchester detested working with Pierce, who she said "truly felt that he made these individuals, similar to he was a godÂ ... in the first part of the day he'd be wearing white as though he were in emergency clinic to play out a task." To play Mary Shelley, Lanchester wore a white net dress weaved with sequins of butterflies, stars, and moons, which the performer had heard required 17 ladies 12 weeks to make. Lanchester said of her lady of the hour ensemble, "I drank as meager fluid as could reasonably be expected. It was a lot of a difficulty to go to the restroom - each one of those swathes - and being joined by my bureau." 

Kenneth Strickfaden made and kept up the research facility gear. Strickfaden reused some of the whimsically named machines he had made for the first "Frankenstein" for use in "Lady of the hour", including the "Vast Ray Diffuser", and the "Nebularium". A lightning jolt produced by Strickfaden's gear has turned into a stock scene, showing up in any number of movies and TV programs. The man behind the film's exceptional photographic impacts was John P. Fulton, leader of the embellishments office at Universal Studios at the time. Fulton and David S. Horsely made the homunculi through the span of two days by shooting the performing artists in full-measure containers against dark velvet and adjusting them to the viewpoint of the on-set containers. The closer view film plate was rotoscoped and tangled onto the back plate. Minor performing artist Billy Barty is quickly unmistakable from the back in the completed film as a homunculus baby in a high seat, yet Whale cut the newborn child's uncover before the film's discharge. 

Whale met Franz Waxman at a gathering and requested that he score the image. "Nothing will be settled in this image aside from the end devastation scene. Would you compose an uncertain score for it?" asked Whale. Waxman made three particular topics: one for the Monster; one for the Bride; and one for Pretorius. The score closes, at Whale's proposal, with a ground-breaking noisy harmony, planned to pass on that the on-screen blast was powerful to the point that the theater where the film was being screened was influenced by it. Constantin Bakaleinikoff led 22 performers to record the score in a solitary nine-hour session. 

Shooting started on January 2, 1935, with an anticipated spending plan of US$293,750 ($ as of )Â â precisely the financial plan of the originalÂ â and an expected 36-day shooting plan. On the main day, Karloff swam in the water beneath the pulverized windmill wearing an elastic suit under his ensemble. Air got into the suit and extended it like a "disgusting water lilly". Soon thereafter, Karloff broke his hip, requiring a trick twofold. Clive had likewise broken his leg. Shooting was finished on March 7, 1935. The film was ten days over calendar since Whale shut down the image for ten days until Heggie ended up accessible to play the Hermit. With a last expense of $397,023 ($ as of ), "Lady" was more than $100,000 ($ as of ) over spending plan. As initially recorded, Henry kicked the bucket escaping the detonating mansion. Whale re-shot the closure of take into consideration their survival, in spite of the fact that Clive is as yet noticeable on-screen in the falling research facility. Whale finished his polished product, shortening the running time from around 90 to 75 minutes and re-shooting and re-altering the completion, just days before the film's planned debut date. 

"Lady of Frankenstein" was exposed to oversight, both amid generation by the Hays office and following its discharge by nearby and national restriction sheets. Joseph Breen, lead blue pencil for the Hays office, questioned lines of discourse in the initially submitted content in which Henry Frankenstein and his work were contrasted with that of God. He kept on questioning such exchange in amended contents, and to an arranged shot of the Monster racing through a cemetery to a figure of an executed Jesus and endeavoring to "salvage" the figure from the cross. Breen likewise protested the quantity of homicides, both seen and suggested by the content and unequivocally exhorted Whale to diminish the number. The blue pencil's office, after exploring the film in March 1935, required various cuts. Whale consented to erase a grouping in which Dwight Frye's "Nephew Glutz" executes his uncle and accuses the Monster, and shots of Elsa Lanchester as Mary Shelley in which Breen felt a lot of her bosoms were unmistakable. Inquisitively, regardless of his prior complaint, Breen offered no protest to the cruciform symbolism all through the filmÂ â incorporating a scene with the Monster lashed Christ-like to a poleÂ â nor to the introduction of Pretorius as a coded gay. "Lady of the hour of Frankenstein" was affirmed by the Production Code office on April 15, 1935. 

Following its discharge with the Code seal of endorsement, the film was tested by the oversight board in the province of Ohio. Edits in England and China protested the scene in which the Monster looks longingly upon the up 'til now unanimated body of the Bride, refering to worries that it looked like necrophilia. Widespread deliberately pulled back the film from Sweden as a result of the broad cuts requested, and "Lady of the hour" was dismissed out and out by Trinidad, Palestine, and Hungary. One unordinary protest, from Japanese edits, was that the scene in which Pretorius pursues his smaller than normal Henry VIII with tweezers established "making a trick out of a lord". 

"Lady of the hour of Frankenstein" was beneficial for Universal, with a 1943 report demonstrating that the film had by then earned around $2 million ($ in cash) for the studio, a benefit of about $950,000 ($ as of ). The film was fundamentally applauded upon its discharge, albeit a few analysts qualified their conclusions dependent on the film's being in the ghastliness sort. The "New York World-Telegram" called the film "great amusement of its sort". The "New York Post" portrayed it as "a twisted, abhorrent story which, of its sort, is swell". "The Hollywood Reporter" comparably called the film "a delight for the individuals who can welcome it". 

"Assortment" did not all that qualify its survey. "[It is] one of those uncommon cases where none can audit it, or discussion about it, without referencing the cameraman, craftsmanship chief, and score writer in a similar breath as the performing artists and executive." "Assortment" additionally lauded the cast, composing that "Karloff figures out how to contribute the character with certain nuances of feeling that are shockingly genuine and touchingÂ ... Thesiger as Dr Pretorious [is] a malicious portrayal if at any point there was oneÂ ... Lanchester handles two assignments, being first in a preface as creator Mary Shelley and after that the made lady. In last task she awes exceedingly." 

In another unfit audit, "Time" composed that the film had "an essentialness that tries their endeavors completely the equivalent of the first pictureÂ ... Screenwriters Hurlbut and Balderston and Director James Whale have given it the horrifying power legitimate to all great frightfulness pieces, yet have substituted an eccentric sort of unthinking poignancy for the sheer shrewd that was "Frankenstein"." The "Oakland Tribune" agreed it was "a dream created on a somewhat sublime scale, with brilliant stagecraft and fine photographic impacts". While the "Winnipeg Free Press" imagined that the electrical hardware may have been more qualified to Buck Rogers, regardless the commentator applauded the film as "energizing and here and there drearily horrifying", announcing that "All who delighted in "Frankenstein" will respect his "Lady" as a commendable successor." "The New York Times" called Karloff "so mind blowing in the job that every one of the one can say is 'he is the Monster. The "Times" adulated the whole chief cast and Whale's bearing in inferring that "Lady" is "a top notch blood and gore movie", and judiciously recommended that "The Monster ought to turn into an organization, as Charlie Chan." "Lady of the hour" was assigned for one Academy Award, for Best Sound Recording (Gilbert Kurland). 

The film's notoriety has endured and developed since its discharge. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an endorsement rating of 100% dependent on 41 surveys, with a normal rating of 9.1/10. The site's basic accord peruses, "An unpredictable, goofy, in fact great, and unnerving picture, James Whale's "Lady of the hour of Frankenstein" has matured surprisingly well." In 1998, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry, having been esteemed "socially, generally or stylishly noteworthy". Much of the time recognized as James Whale's artful culmination, the film is praised as "the best of all gothic blood and gore flicks". "Time" appraised "Lady of the hour of Frankenstein" in its "Unsurpassed 100 Movies", in which commentators Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel overruled the magazine's unique audit to pronounce the film "one of those uncommon continuations that is interminably better than its source". In 2008, "Lady of the hour" was chosen by "Domain" magazine as one of "The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time". Additionally in 2008, the "Boston Herald" named it the second most prominent blood and gore movie after "Nosferatu". In 2016, James Charisma of "Playboy" positioned the film #7 on a rundown of "15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals". "Excitement Weekly" considers the film better than "Frankenstein". 

Christian symbolism shows up all through the film. Notwithstanding the scenes of the Monster trussed in a cruciform posture and the executed figure of Jesus in the burial ground, the New Testament figure-looking recluse has a cross on the mass of his cabin â which, to Whale's dismay, supervisor Ted Kent made shine amid a become dull â and the Monster expends the Christian holy observances of bread and wine at his "last dinner" with the loner. Loathsomeness researcher David J. Skal recommends that Whale's goal was to make an "immediate examination of Frankenstein's beast to Christ". Film researcher Scott MacQueen, noticing Whale's absence of any religious feelings, question the thought that the Monster is a Christ-figure. Or maybe, the Monster is a "joke of the awesome" since, having been made by Man as opposed to God, it "does not have the celestial flash". In killing the Monster, he says, Whale "drives the group of onlookers' catches" by transforming the focal Christian conviction of the demise of Christ pursued by the restoration. The Monster is raised from the dead first, at that point killed. 

In the decades since its discharge, present day film researchers have noticed the conceivable eccentric perusing of the film. Executive James Whale was transparently gay, and a portion of the on-screen characters in the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were accepted to be gay or androgynous. Despite the fact that James Curtis, Whale's biographer, rejects the idea that Whale would have related to the Monster from a gay point of view, researchers have seen a gay subtext suffused through the film, particularly a camp reasonableness, especially epitomized in the character of Pretorius and his association with Henry. 

Gay film history specialist Vito Russo, in considering Pretorius, holds back before distinguishing the character as gay, rather alluding to him as "sissified", "sissy" itself being Hollywood code for "gay". Pretorius fills in as a "gay Mephistopheles", a figure of enticement and allurement, venturing to such an extreme as to pull Frankenstein far from his lady of the hour on their wedding night to take part in the unnatural demonstration of making non-procreative life. A novelization of the film distributed in England made the suggestion unmistakable, having Pretorius state to Frankenstein Be productive and increase.' Let us comply with the Biblical directive: you obviously, have the decision of normal methods; yet concerning me, I am anxious about the possibility that that there is no course open to me however the logical way." 

The Monster, whose affections for the male loner and the female Bride he talks about with indistinguishable language ("companion") has been perused as explicitly "agitated" and swinger. Sex considers writer Elizabeth Young expresses: "He has no intrinsic understanding that the male-female security he is to fashion with the lady of the hour is thought to be the essential one or that it conveys an alternate sexual valence from his associations with [Pretorius and the hermit]: every single full of feeling relationship are as effectively 'fellowships' as 'relational unions'." Indeed, his association with the loner has been translated as an equivalent sex marriage that hetero society won't endure: "No mistakeÂ â this is a marriage, and a reasonable oneÂ ... Yet, Whale reminds us rapidly that society does not endorse. The monsterÂ â the outsiderÂ â is driven from his scene of local delight by two weapon toting rubes who stumble over this surprising coalition and rapidly, intuitively, continue to decimate it", composes social commentator Gary Morris for "Splendid Lights Film Journal". The production of the Bride scene, Morris proceeds, is "Whale's suggestion to the audienceÂ â his Hollywood supervisors, friends, and everybody watchingÂ â of the loftiness and intensity of the gay maker". 

Movie producer Curtis Harrington, a companion and associate of Whale's, expelled this as "a more youthful faultfinder's assessment. All specialists do work that leaves the oblivious personality and later on you can dissect it and state the imagery may mean something, however craftsmen don't imagine that way and I would wager my life that James Whale could never have had such ideas at the top of the priority list." Specifically in light of the "glory and power" perusing, Harrington expressed, "My conclusion is that is simply unadulterated horse crap. That is a basic translation that has nothing to do with the first motivation." He finishes up, "I figure the nearest you can go to a gay analogy in his movies is to recognize that specific kind of camp funniness." Whale's buddy David Lewis expressed straight that Whale's sexual introduction was "not fitting" to his filmmaking, saying, "Jimmy was as a matter of first importance a craftsman, and his movies speak to crafted by an artistÂ â not a gay craftsman, however a craftsman." 

All inclusive Pictures has tried to redo "Lady of the hour of Frankenstein" on a few events. While the novel "Frankenstein" has been adjusted to film commonly, "Lady of Frankenstein"s nearest change was "The Bride" (1985), featuring Sting, Clancy Brown, and Jennifer Beals. In 1991, the studio looked to change the movie for satellite TV, and Martin Scorsese communicated enthusiasm for coordinating. 

In the primary decade of the 21st century, Universal matched with Imagine Entertainment and contracted Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, who composed the screenplay for "American Splendor", to compose a redo. The screenwriters set the story in contemporary New York. Jacob Estes was additionally included with the venture at one point and composed a draft. In June 2009, Universal and Imagine entered exchanges with chief Neil Burger and his composition accomplice Dirk Wittenborn, and maker Brian Grazer was alloted to direct the improvement of the change. 

In December 2015, "Assortment" detailed that David Koepp will compose the content. In May 2017, Universal Pictures declared their common universe film arrangement of rebooted, advanced translations of their great Universal Monsters titled, Dark Universe. The movie arrangement started with the 2017 movie "The Mummy", and is required to proceed with "Lady of Frankenstein" on February 14, 2019 with Bill Condon coordinating the film, yet Universal and Condon have chosen to delay this motion picture. By October 2017, it was accounted for that pre-generation had started when the imaginative group and studio chose to defer the discharge so as to additionally deal with the content with expectations being to improve the story. "Due date" detailed that Javier Bardem and Angelina Jolie are as yet appended to the motion picture as Frankenstein's beast and the film's hesitant lady of the hour, individually. That month Condon expressed that ought to Jolie choose to leave the undertaking, he would be keen on observing Gal Gadot play the main character. In any case, on November 8, 2017, Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan proceeded onward to different activities, leaving the eventual fate of the "Dim Universe" in uncertainty. 

In January 2018, it was accounted for that Condon was gathering a creation group, comprising of cinematographer Tobias A. Schliessler, creation planner Sarah Greenwood, arranger Carter Burwell, and ensemble fashioner Jacqueline Durran. 

In these movies we see a scene of "Lady" communicate on TV. 

The working title, "Lady of the Atom", and the last title of the film "Lady of the hour of the Monster" from 1955 suggest the prior film "Lady of the hour of Frankenstein".
