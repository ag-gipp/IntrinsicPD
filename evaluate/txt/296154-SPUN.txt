The player may likewise switch into first-individual point of view to take into consideration a 360Â° view utilizing the START catch or right simple stick on the diversion controller. Characters and sprites are proportionate with one another, and the player explores Ashley on a three-dimensional field map. Route is continuously, and regions gotten to by the player are put away in an in-amusement map menu. 

Ashley can run, bounce, and push cartons and 3D squares to explore around snags, adding riddle and platforming components to ongoing interaction. Amid the amusement, the player should once in a while tackle square riddles to propel the story. At the point when the player comes back to a finished square riddle room, a period assault mode called "Advance, or Die!!" starts. Players must achieve the finish of the room in the most limited time conceivable, after which they are positioned. This stage is discretionary and can be killed from the menu. 

In the field map, players may connect with the adversary when they enter Battle Mode, which utilizes a pausable constant battle framework, much like Square's "Parasite Eve" (1998). In Battle Mode, when the player taps the assault catch, a round network shows up around Ashley. Singular body parts inside this circle can be focused on. The fight framework includes the player anchoring distinctive assaults known as Chain Abilities to accomplish vast combos and arrangement harm to the foe.

Adversary assaults and spells bargain more harm if the player has high Risk. The preferred standpoint, be that as it may, is the higher shots for the player to score basic hits and reestablish higher HP.

This throws doubt for Ashley's sake, as Riskbreakers dependably work alone. 

The Crimson Blades, compelled of Cardinal Batistum, are a gathering that is a piece of the Cardinal's Knights of the Cross, responsible for looking for apostates and subduing factions. Romeo Guildenstern, their pioneer, is a devout man, profoundly steadfast to his conviction and thusly safe to the Dark's forces.

In his experiences with Sydney, Ashley is appeared of his past, where his better half Tia and his child Marco are murdered by rebels. Meeting Rosencrantz once more, Ashley is informed that they were not his family, however mixed up targets he slaughtered amid a mission of theirs. Ashley's blame over their demises was controlled by the VKP to transform Ashley into a steadfast Riskbreaker. Ashley reviews his concealed fight aptitudes and encounters "special insight", seeing the improvement of the Crimson Blades, which drives him to the Great Cathedral. 

Sydney had caught Callo before and carried her with them. Callo discovered that Hardin was incredulous of Sydney's arrangements. She starts to build up the forces of "heart-seeing", a type of clairvoyance, as they proceed with their departure more profound into LeÃ¡ Monde. With her forces, she learned of Sydney's goals and Hardin's motivation to join MÃ¼llenkamp and his closeness to Joshua. Sydney left them to prevent the others from propelling; insulting Guildenstern and Samantha, and inciting Ashley to tail him as he plans to offer his forces to Ashley. Ashley was not keen on acquiring the forces of Darkness; seeing that Callo had been caught, his solitary aim is to safeguard her. 

While talking about the Gran Grimoire, a ground-breaking wellspring of enchantment, Guildenstern and Samantha find old Kildean letterings cut all through the city dividers. Rosencrantz uncovers that the city is the Gran Grimoire and its capacity lies at the downtown area: the Grand Cathedral. As Guildenstern leaves for the Grand Cathedral, Rosencrantz looks for Ashley and Sydney. Discovering them, Rosencrantz, certain about his insusceptibility against Darkness, attempts to constrain Sydney to surrender his forces. Rosencrantz likewise ambushes Ashley to demonstrate that he is certainly not an appropriate contender for the forces of Darkness. Sydney won't tune in and slaughters Rosencrantz by utilizing a had statue, leaving Ashley to by and by substantiate himself as his picked successor. 

Guildenstern proceeds to the Great Cathedral in the focal point of the city, driving him to Callo, Hardin and Joshua. Grilling Hardin about a specific "key" known as the Blood-Sin, Guildenstern uncovers his goals in getting the Dark's forces. Sydney lands to transport Hardin and the rest away, abandoning him to Guildenstern. Guildenstern gets the "key" from him and murders Samantha as his penance for the forces of murkiness.
