On the three plays that pursued Weatherford's 37-yard pass, Florida State oversaw just six positive yards, yet this all out was to a great extent invalidated by a five-yard false begin punishment that pushed FSU's offense in reverse. Confronting a fourth down, Florida State mentor Bobby Bowden sent in kicker Gary Cismesia to endeavor a 31-yard field objective.

The Florida State touchback permitted Vick to begin at his 20-yard line for Virginia Tech's second ownership of the amusement. The ownership started no superior to the first, as Virginia Tech submitted a 10-yard holding punishment on the principal play. On resulting plays, nonetheless, the Hokie offense started to move the ball with progress. Vick finished a 12-yard go to wide beneficiary Eddie Royal, and the offense was supported by a 15-yard Florida State punishment, which gave the Hokies a programmed first down. Following the first down, Vick finished the principal enormous Virginia Tech play of the amusement, tossing the ball 35Â yards downfield to Justin Harper, who got it in Florida State an area. Two more plays drove Virginia Tech to the edge of the Florida State red zone, however a punishment and another sack kept the Hokies from propelling the ball further.

A fragmented pass and a scramble for no addition were trailed by a bogus begin punishment and another inadequate pass, and Florida State was compelled to punt. Virginia Tech recouped the ball at its 26-yard line, however neglected to gain by the cautious stop. Marcus Vick tossed two deficient passes and was sacked before Virginia Tech was constrained into a punt. 

Following the punt, the two groups kept on exchanging assets all through the quarter. Barrier commanded, and what couple of huge plays happened were either killed by punishments or ceased by fragmented passes or scrambles for no addition. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech punted the ball twice and turned the ball over on downs once. Florida State punted the ball multiple times and had the ball when time ran out in the quarter. Neither one of the teams figured out how to score, and just twice did either group figure out how to enter into the adversary's region. At halftime, the score stayed tied, 3â 3. 

Since Florida State had gotten the amusement's opening kickoff, Virginia Tech got the ball to start the second half. As in the primary half, be that as it may, the Virginia Tech offense neglected to propel the ball in any important style. Marcus Vick tossed two inadequacies and running back Cedric Humes dealt with a short three-yard dash. Compelled to punt the ball away once more, Virginia Tech set up the amusement's basic play.

Reid's arrival was the primary touchdown of the amusement and the main touchdown in ACC Championship Game history. With 13:46 staying in the second from last quarter, Florida State had taken a 10â 3 lead. 

After the kickoff, the Hokie offense proceeded with the laziness that had portrayed its play in the primary half, as Mike Imoh was ceased for no or little increase on back to back plays before the Hokies were required a five-yard illicit technique punishment. On the following play, Florida State profited by the force it had picked up with Reid's punt-return touchdown as protector Pat Watkins captured Marcus Vick's pass, returning it to the FSU 44-yard line. Drew Weatherford and the Seminole offense, with the diversion's force immovably to support them, squandered no time growing their lead. Weatherford finished a 6-yard pass, at that point a 21-yard one, and was supported by a 15-yard facemask punishment against Virginia Tech. Somewhere inside Virginia Tech domain, the third play of the drive was a 14-yard touchdown surge by Leon Washington.

The scoring drive had taken only three plays and 54Â seconds, and gave Florida State a 17â 3 lead with 10:23 staying in the quarter. 

Their dissatisfaction plainly obvious, the Virginia Tech offense fared no better on their next belonging. Two plays were halted for no addition, and the main positive playâa five-yard go to Eddie Royalâwas nullified by a bogus begin punishment. The Hokies were again compelled to punt the ball away to Florida State, their fifth of the diversion. The punt permitted FSU to begin at their own 46-yard line, and at first, the Seminoles had the capacity to gain by that chance, appearing of the adequacy that portrayed their earlier drive. Lorenzo Booker kept running for 24Â yards on two plays, however thereafter, Drew Weatherford tossed two deficiencies. A bogus begin punishment sponsored up the Seminoles, who were compelled to punt in the wake of neglecting to get the first down. The kick was a brilliant one, and Florida State's extraordinary groups had the capacity to get this show on the road downfield and stop the ball inside the Virginia Tech one-yard line, again harming the Hokie offense. 

In spite of the fact that hampered by the need to work inside his own end zone, Marcus Vick finished a 11-yard go to tight end Jeff King for a first down. The play was the sole positive addition for the VT offense, be that as it may, and Virginia Tech was constrained into its 6th punt of the diversion. The kick was a poor one, and voyaged just 28Â yards before flying outside the field of play. Because of the awful kick, Weatherford had the capacity to begin his offense inside Virginia Tech region, and exploited the circumstance. On the principal play after the punt, Weatherford finished a 41-yard toss downfield to Willie Reid, who pulled in the ball at the Virginia Tech three-yard line to give the Seminoles a first and objective. After a fizzled quarterback sneak, in any case, Florida State was punished 10Â yards for holding and Weatherford was sacked for lost threeÂ yards on the following play. Albeit unfit to cross the objective line for a touchdown, FSU sent in kicker Gary Cismesia for his second field objective endeavor of the day. The kick, a 41-yarder, was great and gave Florida State a 20â 3 lead with 4:23 staying in the second from last quarter. 

Following the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense took the field severely expecting to chop down Florida State's lead so as to permit enough time for a final quarter rebound. This was not to be, be that as it may, as on the 6th play of the drive, wide recipient David Clowney mishandled the ball in the wake of getting a three-yard go from Marcus Vick. The ball was effectively recuperated by Florida State's Broderick Bunkley, subsequently giving Florida State another brilliant opportunity to score from somewhere inside Virginia Tech domain. On the second play after the bobble, quarterback Drew Weatherford associated on a 22-yard strike to Greg Carr to drive inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. A five-yard facemask punishment against Virginia Tech just added to the Hokies' protective issues, and twoÂ plays later, Weatherford topped the drive with a six-yard touchdown go to Chris Davis, extending the Florida State lead to 27â 3 with simply 18Â seconds staying in the quarter. 

Toward the finish of the second from last quarter, any desire for triumph was apparently distant for Virginia Tech. Three speedy plays after the kickoff brought about a first down before time ran out, yet toward the finish of the second from last quarter, Florida State still had a 27â 3 lead. 

Virginia Tech started the final quarter possessing the ball and with a first down, yet trailing by 24Â points and for all intents and purposes out of the diversion. The initial two plays of the final quarter were like what the Tech offense had appeared diversion: a fragmented pass and a scramble for no yards. On the third play, in any case, Florida State was punished 15Â yards for having such a large number of players on the field, and Virginia Tech was granted a programmed first down. The punishment enabled the Hokie offense to proceed with its drive, and Marcus Vick mixed for 16Â yards on the following play, at that point tossed a 28-yard go to wide collector Josh Morgan, who broke free for a touchdown. The score was Virginia Tech's first touchdown of the diversion, and accompanied 13:03 staying in the amusement. Following the touchdown, the Hokies endeavored a two-point transformation, yet Vick's pass missed the mark and the change endeavor fizzled. The score slice the Florida State lead to 27â 9, however this was as yet an extensive edge for the measure of time staying in the amusement. 

Florida State got the post-score kickoff simply expecting to rundown the clock to verify its lead and the success. TwoÂ complete leaves set behind a third-and-two for Drew Weatherford, yet his third-down pass missed the mark, ceasing the clock and driving a Florida State punt. One moment and a half had kept running off the clock, and Virginia Tech recouped the punt at its 22-yard line. On the second play after the punt, Florida State submitted a pass obstruction punishment that gave Virginia Tech 15Â automatic yards and a first down. As in the past drive, the extra shot began the Virginia Tech offense. On the following play, Vick associated with Josh Morgan on a 50-yard passâthe longest hostile play of the diversionâthat drove the Hokies to the Florida State nine-yard line. From that point onward, a Florida State holding punishment gave Virginia Tech a first-and-objective from inside the FSU five-yard line. Marcus Vick mixed fourÂ yards for the touchdown, and what had been a 24-point Seminole lead was currently sliced to 11Â points. The drive had taken quite recently 55Â seconds off the clock, and it gave the idea that Virginia Tech still got an opportunity to make it a nearby amusement. As previously, Virginia Tech endeavored a two-point change, and as previously, it fizzled. With 10:50 staying in the diversion, the score was currently Florida State 27, Virginia Tech 15. 

Florida State started work at its 30-yard line, again expecting to simply rundown the clock to guarantee triumph. As previously, nonetheless, Drew Weatherford got off the ground, tossing a two-yard pass. Two hurrying plays pursued, however were halted for little addition. Florida State again went three-and-out and needed to punt. More than two minutes had been kept running off the clock, and Virginia Tech took over at its own 30-yard line after a seven-yard kick return. In contrast to the two past drives, nonetheless, Virginia Tech had no accomplishment on offense. A 10-yard holding punishment drove the Hokie offense back to begin the drive, and quarterback Marcus Vick was sacked for a misfortune to complete off the Tech ownership. VT was compelled to punt the ball back to Florida State, which took over at its 43-yard line with 6:21 remaining. 

By this point in the diversion, Florida State was completely dedicated to running down the clock and executed three straight surging plays to keep the time running out. Virginia Tech was compelled to utilize two of its timeouts to stop the clock, yet was inevitably effective in constraining a Seminole punt. The kick moved inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line before being brought down, sticking the Hokies somewhere down in their region. The primary play of Tech's drive was right around a fiasco for Virginia Tech, as Marcus Vick bobbled the ball while endeavoring to maintain a strategic distance from a sack. Luckily for the Hokies, the ball was jumped on by Tech's Duane Brown and the drive remained alive. Virginia Tech moved the ball downfield through the air with trouble. Because of the restricted time remaining, Virginia Tech was compelled to depend primarily on passing plays, which halted the clock when fragmented or were finished for a first down. A 14-yard go to Josh Morgan and a 10-yard toss to Cedric Humes moved the Hokies to their 47-yard line. Vick then finished a 19-yard go to Jeff King and Florida State submitted a 15-yard roughing the passer punishment on Marcus Vick, which was attached onto the finish of the play. After the punishment, Virginia Tech's offense was somewhere down in Florida State an area, and two plays later, Marcus Vick kept running into the end zone on a one-yard quarterback scramble. As opposed to endeavor another two-point transformation, the Hokies kicked the additional point, and with 1:44 residual, Virginia Tech had shut the hole to 27â 22. 

In a circumstance with additional time, Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and sought after a cautious stop to give the offense a possibility for a diversion winning drive. With under twoÂ minutes remaining, in any case, and with Virginia Tech having utilized all its timeouts, the main shot for the Hokies was to endeavor a troublesome onside kick. An effective recuperation would give the Hokies another shot on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball, and kicked it advances, bobbing the ball high into the air to make a hop ball circumstance. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recouped the ball, but since the kick had just voyage nineÂ yards before the recuperation, the ball was granted to Florida State. NCAA decides express that an onside kick must go in any event 10Â yards before the kicking group can legitimately contact the ball, and Pace's kick had not ventured to every part of the essential separation. 

Having recuperated the ball, and with Virginia Tech having no remaining timeouts and no real way to stop the clock, Florida State had the capacity to run out the rest of the time in the diversion and secure a 27â 22 triumph. Towards the finish of the amusement, players in each group acted with antagonistic vibe towards one another, and a few got individual foul punishments. The punishments had no impact on the ultimate result of the amusement, and Florida State won the ACC Championship Game and a programmed offer to the 2006 Orange Bowl. 

Because of his execution in driving Florida State to the success, FSU quarterback Drew Weatherford was named the amusement's Most Valuable Player. Weatherford completed the amusement having finished 21Â of his 35Â passes for 225Â yards and oneÂ touchdown. Weatherford would in the end complete the season with 3,180Â passing yards, the most at any point recorded by a first year recruit quarterback in the ACC. On the contrary side of the ball, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick completed the diversion 26Â for 52Â with 335Â yards, oneÂ interception, and oneÂ touchdown. Despite the fact that Vick was marginally preferred factually over Weatherford and the Hokies were all the more measurably effective on offense because of Vick, the Most Valuable Player grant isn't typically given to a player on the losing group. 

Virginia Tech turned the ball over twiceâonce on a mishandle and once on a capture. The two turnovers brought about twoÂ touchdowns for Florida State, and the subsequent 14 points were more noteworthy than Florida State's edge of triumph. The Seminoles did not turn the ball over amid the diversion. The two groups were very punished amid the amusement. Virginia Tech completed with 17Â penalties for 143Â yards, while Florida State was punished 12Â times for 114Â yards. The punishments influenced each group's capacity to change over third downs, as Virginia Tech was just ready to change over 9Â of 20Â third-down endeavors, while Florida State was fruitful on simply 3Â of its 13Â attempts. Notwithstanding trailing for a great part of the diversion and running a pass-overwhelming offense, Virginia Tech commanded the amusement's season of ownership, controlling the ball for over 35Â of the diversion's 60Â minutes. 

Florida State's 27â 22 triumph over Virginia Tech verified it the 2005 ACC Championship and an offer to the Orange Bowl. The triumph additionally had progressively outstretching influences for bowl amusement offers over the Atlantic Coast Conference and enduring repercussions amid the football season that pursued the diversion. 

Florida State (8â 4) earned a BCS billet regardless of a record substandard compared to the next seven BCS groups. Despite that reality, the Seminoles' matchup with Penn State (10â 1) in the 2006 Orange Bowl, where school football's two most dominating mentors, Penn State's 78-year-old Joe Paterno and Florida State's 76-year-old Bobby Bowden, squared off. 

Virginia Tech acknowledged an offer to the 2006Â Gator Bowl, which was likewise played in Jacksonville, though a month later than the ACC Championship Game. The Gator Bowl Committee chose the Hokies over Miami because of Virginia Tech's notoriety for having an extensive fan base that voyaged well. Virginia Tech's determination knock Miami to the 2005 Peach Bowl, while the Virginia Cavaliers were chosen for the Music City Bowl and the Clemson Tigers earned an offer to the Champs Sports Bowl. 

In the off-season following the ACC Championship Game and Florida State's choice by the Orange Bowl, the Orange Bowl board reported it would go into a selective contract with the ACC to concede the victor of the ACC Championship Game a programmed offer to the Orange Bowl except if it was positioned sufficiently high in the Bowl Championship Series standings to play in the BCS National Championship Game. 

Following the ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick raged off the field, declining to converse with columnists. Vick, who got a 15-yard unsportsmanlike lead punishment late in the diversion, likewise earned a few unsportsmanlike direct punishments in the 2006Â Gator Bowl, where post-amusement replays uncovered that he intentionally stepped on the leg of Louisville Cardinals' guarded end Elvis Dumervil. Vick asserted he was sorry to Dumervil after the diversion, however Dumervil expressed that no statement of regret had been made. In the wake of the occurrence, Virginia Tech authorities reported that they would direct an audit of Vick's lead on and off the field. 

On January 6, 2006, only a couple of days after that diversion, Virginia Tech authorities rejected Vick from the Virginia Tech football crew, refering to a December 17 traffic stop in which Vick was refered to for speeding and driving with a repudiated or suspended permit. Vick had concealed the data from the group and the infraction was not found until January. The traffic stop, a prior suspension from the group, and his unsportsmanlike lead amid the 2005 ACC Championship Game and 2006 Gator Bowl were utilized as reason for his expulsion.
