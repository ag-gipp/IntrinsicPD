Dowling joined the Australian unexpected at the surrender of Japan in Tokyo Bay on 2Â September 1945. Following the suspension of threats, "Hobart" moved toward becoming lead of HM Australian Squadron, and Dowling banner skipper and head of staff to Commodore John Collins, the squadron leader. The war had negatively affected Dowling's wellbeing, and he required leave before starting his next arrangement in May 1946 as Director of Ordnance, Torpedoes and Mines at the Navy Office. Back Admiral James Goldrick, in the "Australian Dictionary of Biography", saw that Dowling "was pushed into the most astounding places of the RAN to a great extent because of the substantial losses of World WarÂ II". At the point when John Armstrongâthe main likewise qualified and progressively senior Navy chiefâwas articulated unfit for seagoing obligation, Dowling was allowed to order Australia's first plane carrying warship, , authorized in England on 16Â December 1948. In April the next year, two months after the ship's overdue acknowledgment into administration because of early stage struggles, Dowling set out "Sydney" for Australia with two squadrons of warriors on board.

On 15 June, he joined individual head of staff Lieutenant General Henry Wells and Air Marshal John McCauley, Prime Minister Robert Menzies, and senior government individuals in favoring a draft mandate for the job of the Far East Strategic Reserve (FESR); this made Commonwealth powers accessible for the battle against socialist radicals in Malaya, just as for the security of Malaya and Singapore against outer animosity. The Navy's commitment to the FESR was to be somewhere around two destroyers or frigates on a continuous premise, just as a yearly visit by a plane carrying warship. The destroyers and , as of now in the district on an activity, were promptly dedicated, and Dowling traveled to Singapore to actually report the arrangement and the explanations behind it to the boats' groups. 

Dowling was an early backer for the foundation of an Australian submarine armada; in 1963, after a few false begins, the first of six "Oberon"- class submarines was requested. As a feature of a general Western pattern that saw with alert the expanding ability of the Soviet Navy's surface armada, Dowling additionally attempted to improve the hostile intensity of the Fleet Air Arm. In March 1956, he ventured to such an extreme as proposing buy of atomic weaponry for the RAN's De Havilland Sea Venoms. Amid quite a bit of Dowling's residual time as CNS, looked with the oldness of HMAS "Sydney" and as per its two-transporter strategy, the Navy attempted fruitlessly to gain another and bigger plane carrying warship to expand . Having confidence in the support of generally close ties between the RAN and the Royal Navy, he attempted to facilitate his strategies as CNS with those of Britain's First Sea Lord, Earl Mountbatten.

Different issues confronting the RAN amid Dowling's term as CNS were its assignmentâsince the start of the 1950sâto third place behind the other military regarding Federal spending designations, its substitution by the RAAF as the nation's first line of barrier, and a lack of labor. Dowling himself considered "division from families, absence of houses, over business, high wages and extra time installment in civvie road" as the foundations for the Navy's failure to draw in and hold work force; the Allison Report in 1958 brought about different upgrades to support conditions, which diminished wastage. The RANC had moved to Flinders Naval Depot in 1930, and Dowling was satisfied to have the capacity to direct its arrival to Jervis Bay in 1958, the prior year he moved the workplace of the CNS to Canberra.

On 23Â March he took over from Sir Henry Wells as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC), a job hinting that of the modern Chief of the Defense Force. He was prevailing as CNS by Vice Admiral Henry Burrell. Joyfully astonished by his arrangement as Chairman of COSC, Dowling wanted to change the position to such an extent that it would practice direction specialist over the administration boss, however in this he was to be frustrated. The position's rank continued as before as the leaders of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and was in charge of putting their perspectives on military issues to the Minister for Defense. Different mishaps amid his residency incorporated the Defense Department's choiceârepealed after his termâto disband the Fleet Air Arm, and the Federal government's inability to back him when he reported at a SEATO public interview in March 1961 that Australia was set up to mediate militarily in the second Laotian emergency should it become vital. In September 1959, amid the primary Laotian emergency, the Australian government had approved Dowling to submit "an infantry regiment, a squadron of RAAF warriors, air transport, and two RAN destroyers" to help US and SEATO powers, however no mediation occurred. 

Dowling resigned from the military on 27Â May 1961 and was prevailing as Chairman of COSC via Air Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger. In spite of the fact that quick to verify a conciliatory arrangement, nothing was offered to him and, as a rehearsing Anglican, he rather busied himself with chapel issues in Canberra. In July 1962, the administration gave him obligation regarding sorting out Queen Elizabeth II's forthcoming illustrious visit. In this job he was required to liaise with the state governments to design the Queen's schedule, and to turn into an individual from the regal family unit for the term of the visit, the first run through an Australian visit organizer had been given such close access to a meeting ruler. He was remunerated with arrangement as a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) as of 27Â March 1963, and wound up Australian Secretary to the Queen on 1Â November that year. Dowling was likewise the Australian Red Cross Society's Canberra executive from 1962 to 1967; at the time he assumed control over the chairmanship, Lady Dowling was acting leader of the association, without Lady William Oliver. Roy Dowling kicked the bucket of a heart assault on 15Â April 1969 in Canberra Hospital. He was given a maritime burial service at St John's Church, and incinerated. His better half and five kids endure him.
