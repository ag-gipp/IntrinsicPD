This and different postpones constrained material initially made arrangements for "Soul Reaver" to be rather discharged with later rounds of the arrangement. "Soul Reaver" was commonly generally welcomed by commentators and lauded for its fascinating gothic story and fantastic designs. In any case, the diversion was reprimanded for straightforward and redundant ongoing interaction and a sub-par peak. 

The player controls Raziel, a deformed and spooky vampire. The amusement is typically appeared from a third-individual point of view behind Raziel, however players can pivot the perspective around him. Ongoing interaction depends to a great extent on moving between the material and ghastly planes of presence to advance through regions. In spite of the fact that collaboration with items is constrained in the unearthly domain, this can be favorable, in light of the fact that Raziel can stage through generally obstructed entryways there, and water is meager, enabling him to stroll on lakebeds; be that as it may, squares, entryways, and switches can be controlled just in the physical domain. Numerous riddles depend on the contrasts between the two domains; for instance, stages and condition includes in one domain may change structure to open new ways in the other. Square riddles are likewise normal and require the turn, flipping, and moving of vast squares to advance, regularly with a period limit and keeping in mind that dodging adversaries.

In the ghastly domain, players battle minor adversaries called Sluagh and the spirits of dead vampires who have moved toward becoming apparitions. Each brood of vampire adversaries has one of a kind forces reminiscent of their group chief. Human and ghostly foes can be executed with Raziel's hooks or any weapon, however vampires must be cudgeled into a staggered state and after that annihilated by skewering them, lighting them ablaze, or hurling them into a risk, for example, daylight or water. Whenever executed, adversaries desert spirits that renew Raziel's wellbeing, which consequently diminishes in the material domain and increments in the otherworldly. Ownership of the Soul Reaver sword stops programmed degeneration of wellbeing in the physical domain, yet Raziel loses the sword in a split second in the event that he continues harm and can recover it just by reestablishing his wellbeing to full. 

At first, Raziel can bounce, float utilizing his torn wings, move squares, and get and toss articles and foes. At first unarmed, he battles utilizing his hooks, however can on the other hand use weapons, for example, rocks, lights, lances and staffs, and the Soul Reaver.

Absolution in heavenly fire can change the Soul Reaver into the Fire Reaver, which can set foes ablaze and adds flame to Raziel's supernatural jolts. Players can likewise discover supernatural glyphs that permit Raziel to use otherworldly vitality to assault gatherings of adversaries all the while. These glyphs commonly include vampire shortcomings, for example, daylight, flame, water, or sound, just as augmentations, for example, supernatural power (accessible well before the ordinary supernatural power winds up accessible) and the causing of tremors to briefly paralyze foes. Glyphs are obtained through discovering glyph raised areas, explicit areas in Nosgoth where the aptitudes can be learned, and explaining a riddle before being allowed the otherworldly capacity. Nonetheless, Raziel starts the diversion with access to the 'Move' glyph, conceding the capacity to move between the material and unearthly planes, with no glyph special raised area important. 

"Soul Reaver" happens inside the anecdotal universe of Nosgoth, where the wellbeing of the land is fixing to the nine Pillars of Nosgoth, and every column thus is spoken to by a gatekeeper. Before the occasions of "Soul Reaver", the gatekeepers ended up degenerate, and, after Kain executed eight of them, he found he was the last one. Declining to forfeit himself to reestablish the Pillars, he bound Nosgoth to endless rot and continued to raise his vampire lieutenants, including Raziel, to blockade the land. When of "Soul Reaver"s presentation, the vampires are currently the land's prevailing species and zenith predators, the people have been crushed, and the vampire clans have each asserted a locale of Nosgoth and directed their concentration toward inner issues.

In a demonstration of appearing desire, Kain tears the bones from Raziel's wings and has him tossed into the Lake of the Dead, a huge regular whirlpool; in any case, Raziel is revived as a phantom by The Elder God to turn into his "spirit reaver" and execute Kain, in this manner reestablishing Nosgoth. With The Elder God's direction, Raziel adjusts to his new shape and comes back to Nosgoth. Penetrating a Necropolis possessed by the Melchahim vampires, Raziel discovers his sibling Melchiah, who has degenerated into a brute unfit to continue his very own tissue. After Raziel murders Melchiah and ingests his spirit, he goes up against Kain among the demolished Pillars of Nosgoth in the Sanctuary of the Clans. Kain does not seem shocked to see Raziel, evidently having even been anticipating him, and suggests that he has crushed Raziel's vampire group, which just infuriates Raziel much further. At the point when Raziel starts to censure him, Kain just dispatches a tirade against him before taking note of what has happened to the domain and drawing in him in battle. Kain rapidly overwhelms Raziel and endeavors to hit him down with the Soul Reaver, an incredible sword that retains its exploited people's spirits; in any case, the Reaver breaks when it strikes Raziel, and Kain get away, abnormally fulfilled.

Raziel murders Zephon and utilizations the picked up capacity to penetrate an old tomb. There, Raziel finds pine boxes for individuals from the Sarafan, an over the top request of vampire seekers murdered hundreds of years before Kain's standard. Regrettably, he finds the sepulcher was assigned for him and his siblings; as pitiless incongruity, Kain restored the Sarafan to serve him as his vampire children. Raziel adventures through a mystery section under the sepulcher and finds an overflowed monastery occupied by the Rahabim tribe, whose individuals have changed into creatures of land and water; its pioneer, Rahab, has turned into a merman. Raziel reveals to Rahab what he has found out about their human pasts, however Rahab is unaffected, guaranteeing that Kain "spared" them, and assaults. Raziel massacres Rahab and ingests his spirit, at that point crosses the Lake of the Dead to the surrendered post of his sibling Dumah. The Elder God clarifies that the Dumahim vampires were dissipated after an intrusion of human seekers. Raziel inevitably discovers Dumah shackled to his position of authority with his heart pierced. Raziel resuscitates Dumah and leads him into a goliath heater, consuming him alive and engrossing his spirit. 

A short time later, Raziel finds the Oracle's Cave, where Moebius the Time Streamer once concealed the Chronoplast, a supernatural time machine. Raziel navigates the caverns and discovers Kain in the Chronoplast's control room. Raziel is enraged over what he has realized, and Kain says his activities are advocated because of his being liable to fate, before continuing to advise Raziel that the Sarafan were a long way from the honorable crusaders that Raziel trusts them to be the point at which the last requests to know why he made him, which Raziel will not tune in to. Raziel assaults Kain while the last keeps on modifying the Chronoplast's controls. In spite of the fact that Raziel in the long run picks up favorable position, the Chronoplast actuates, and Kain escapes through a period entrance, coaxing Raziel to pursue. Raziel goes along, overlooking admonitions from The Elder God. As the amusement closes, Raziel rises up out of the timeslip and is welcomed by Moebius, driving into the occasions of "Soul Reaver 2".

Amid plan, the improvement group made bigger territories that could be investigated all the more completely as Raziel gained new powers, keeping away from the "shallow[ness]" of "Blood Omen"s format.

These defers constrained Crystal Dynamics to cut huge diversion material, including extra powers for Raziel, a third fight with Kain, and an extended Glyph framework which would have given essential forces to the Soul Reaver. In a meeting, arrangement chief Amy Hennig expressed that the improvement group split the first, a lot bigger plans in two in the wake of understanding that they had "over-structured the diversion", given the limitations on schedule and information. This choice clarifies "Soul Reaver"s cliffhanger finishing and the presence of initially arranged material in later diversions.
