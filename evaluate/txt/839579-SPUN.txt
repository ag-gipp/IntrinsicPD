Asphalt self-discharged the EP as a 7" vinyl record without anyone else record name Treble Kicker in 1989. The music of "Kill Tracks" was impacted by non mainstream and punk musical crews, for example, Swell Maps and The Fall, and a significant number of the verses were motivated by life in the band's main residence of Stockton, California. 

Albeit just 1000 duplicates of "Kill Tracks" were squeezed, the EP turned into an underground hit. Upon discharge, the EP was fundamentally adulated by freely delivered zines. The EP figured out how to create buzz for Pavement in the UK after a front of the melody "Box Elder" by The Wedding Present got some airplay from the celebrated radio circle racer John Peel. The discharge and relative achievement of "Kill Tracks" was huge to Pavement's resulting marking to Drag City, and later to Matador Records. The band's "Westing (By Musket and Sextant)" (1993) gathered the melodies from the band's three EPs preceding their presentation collection "Inclined and Enchanted": "Kill Tracks", "Pulverization Plot J-7", and "Immaculate Sound Forever". The arrangement enabled those melodies to contact a more extensive gathering of people than the EP's constrained beginning discharge. 

Asphalt was shaped in 1989 in Stockton, California, by Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg. Malkmus and Kannberg had recently performed together in the band Bag O' Bones. Asphalt had its begin playing at open mike evenings at clubs and bars. The melodies the band played amid this time were for the most part covers, in spite of the fact that they likewise performed numerous unique tunes that would later be discharged on "Kill Tracks". Malkmus reviews, "It was quite sensible to have the capacity to make a solitary for $1,000, so we chose to take the plunge. We didn't have any genuine plans since we weren't a genuine band." Two neighborhood studios existed in Stockton, the less expensive and less expertly disapproved of which was Gary Young's Louder Than You Think Studio. The band chose to record at Young's studio because of their profound respect of other nearby punk groups who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities. Kannberg apparently obtained $800 from his dad to record "Kill Tracks". 

"Kill Tracks" was recorded amid a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, portraying the studio and the chronicle procedure, stated, "You go into his home and it's stuff all over, old pooches lying around, huge pot plants all over the place, and Gary discloses to us that he got all his hardware by selling pot! It was us going in and basically simply setting out the tunes with a guide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and after that we'd play drums over the top." Young, however puzzled by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He reviewed, "[Malkmus and Kannberg] come in and they play this odd guitar clamor and it just seems like commotion, with no foundation. My drums were in there so I stated, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'OK.'" Kannberg stated, "We did it actually quick. We most likely gone through one day following and one day blending it." The title of the EP had been chosen before its account, and the pen names. what's more, Spiral Stairs were utilized to credit Malkmus and Kannberg individually. 

The music on "Kill Tracks" was composed totally by Malkmus, and he expressed his effects on the record included Chrome, Swell Maps, and The Fall. The melodies on the EP attracted correlations with any semblance of R.E.M., Pixies, and Sonic Youth by Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Heather Phares of AllMusic. Radio static and commotion are noticeably utilized on the EP, systems which are normal for the lo-fi and clamor pop sorts that Pavement are every now and again connected with. As per Malkmus, "We chose to utilize static as the third instrument. ... It was entirely energizing to be so test." Young played drums on "Box Elder" and "Cost Yeah!", and every now and again extemporized. Malkmus played drums on "Possibly Maybe", while both Malkmus and Kannberg drummed on "She Believes". 

"No doubt about it", the longest melody on the EP at three minutes and 20 seconds, is a case of the effect punk shake had on Pavement. The melody highlights fluff impacts, dreary verses, and no percussion or drums. "Box Elder", an unexpected melody about somebody needing to move to Box Elder, Montana, was considered by Gerard Cosloy to be a case of Malkmus' "straightforward, direct, and shortsighted" expressive style, and highlights more prominent impact from popular music than the remainder of the EP. "Perhaps Maybe" highlights contorted guitars and mixed up vocals, and "Cost Yeah!" has a sound run of the mill of no-nonsense punk. The band's main residence of Stockton motivated the band's verses and sound. Malkmus expressed that "There's something void about Stockton. I needed to pass on that in our music." Malkmus told "Song Maker" in 1992 that "Asphalt was initially a disgraceful exertion by us to accomplish something to get away from the terminal weariness we were encountering in Stockton." 

In the wake of account was finished Kannberg was entrusted with discharging the music himself, as Malkmus had left on a trek to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Kannberg planned the front of the EP and sent duplicates to different autonomous marks, merchants, and zines. He reviewed "I had no clue how to do it. I'd send off these little notes to my most loved marks like SST and Twin Tone and ask, 'How would I do this?'" A delegate from SST prescribed that Kannberg use Erica Records, a Los Angeles 7" producer. Erica Records turned into the maker of "Kill Tracks"; notwithstanding, Kannberg was discontent with the ace chronicle created by the organization: "It sounds like it sounds presentlyâit's only a wreckâyet being poor and not by any means minding I stated, 'Alright, that is cool, in the event that it sounds like thatâ whatever.'" 1000 duplicates of "Kill Tracks" were squeezed, and the initial 50 incorporated a green dinosaur stamp on the name. The EP was disseminated individually Treble Kicker Records in the United States and England, despite the fact that Malkmus went over a duplicate in a record store while visiting Austria. 

"Kill Tracks" found unforeseen consideration after the Leeds, England-based band The Wedding Present secured "Box Elder" all alone 1990 EP, "Brassneck". The Wedding Present's bassist, Keith Gregory, had been acquainted with "Kill Tracks" by future Pavement bassist Mark Ibold while visiting New York City. The Wedding Present spread is not the same as the first in that the line "that I needed to get the fuck out of this town" was changed to "that I needed to get directly out of this town". The "Container Elder" spread got radio airplay from persuasive English plate racer John Peel, which produced attention for both The Wedding Present and Pavement. Neither individual from Pavement knew about the spread until Kannberg was educated of it. Kannberg recollected that "I was somewhat frantic. I had no clue that individuals could do that, so I was altogether insulted." However, his feeling of the spread and its noteworthiness later transformed: "It was cool to the point that some band from the UK needed to cover this darken, awfully recorded tune. At the time I most likely never valued the full degree of how them covering the melody helped Pavement, particularly in the UK, however it truly did, and I'll generally be appreciative to them for that." 

Not long after its discharge, "Kill Tracks" turned into a gatherer's thing. As per an April 1990 Drag City official statement, duplicates were normally sold for $500â $600. Malkmus and Kannberg each kept 100 duplicates of the EP, and Malkmus said "I used to offer them for fifty dollars. When I required cash I'd go in and pitch a couple to the store and they'd sell for a hundred dollars each. I once in a while meet any individual who got it when it initially turned out." Malkmus likewise said that the pair "most likely gave away around one-hundred to companions and groups we later visited with." The tunes on "Kill Tracks" discovered airplay on a few school radio stations, including University of Virginia's WTJU and University of California, Berkeley's KALX.

"Spin"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s audit stated: "a long stream of commotion water is precluded by Pavement. ... What a gathering!" A commentator for "Alternative" commended the band's lo-fi attributes and frame of mind, calling the EP "free and deliberately lo-fi," and saying "how about we trust this Pavement remains broke." "School Music Journal"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> audit was likewise great, taking note of "That is no joke" and "She Believes" as features, and considering the EP a "profound, inebriating breath of custom made music from individuals with tongues in their cheeks and hearts on their sleeves ... the twin motor input and fluff hits right on target with innocent melodic parity, and whether that is regardless of or as a result of the messy, one-take feel is insignificant." 

Youthful's drum execution on "Kill Tracks" in the end prompted him joining Pavement as a full-time part. Youthful delivered the gathering's 1990 EP "Pulverization Plot J-7", however shown threatening vibe toward then-current drummer Jason Fawkes. Fawkes left Pavement in 1991 because of ill will with Malkmus, enabling Young to drum on their third EP, "Immaculate Sound Forever". Youthful drummed on all Pavement discharges from that point on until 1992's "Watery, Domestic", after which he was terminated for his undeniably whimsical conduct and was supplanted with Steve West. Youthful's drumming on "Kill Tracks" was later perceived as an essential defining moment in Pavement's history, and was viewed as "an amazing chance" by C. Harris-Nystrom of the "News and Review". 

Dan Koretzky, author of Drag City, requested 200 duplicates of the EP for the Chicago Reckless Records store he worked for at the time. Koretzky inquired as to whether he would sign to Drag City amid a similar telephone call that he requested the EP. Kannberg communicated hesitance to sign to any name, however Drag City maker and session performer Rian Murphy reviewed that "We asked, they said yes. Lives didn't appear to be hanging in the balance." Chris Lombardi and Gerard Cosloy of Matador Records additionally first knew about Pavement after Kannberg sent a duplicate of "Kill Tracks" to their zine, "Strife". Bullfighter marked Pavement in 1992 for the arrival of their presentation studio collection, "Inclined and Enchanted".
