Emptied to the United Kingdom for treatment, he didn't come back to his unit until October, when he was elevated to major. In November he was again referenced in despatches for "recognized and courageous administrations and commitment to obligation in the field". The ninth Battalion kept on going ahead at the bleeding edge through the most exceedingly bad European winter in 40 years. On 24 February, Wilder-Neligan was preparing his troops for another attack in power, this time on the German position known as "The Maze", south of the town of Le Barque, when it was found that the Germans were pulling back from the bleeding edge. Alongside the remainder of the third Brigade, the ninth Battalion was before long progressing towards the town, striking disengaged pockets of obstruction. After this, the brigade followed up the Germans as they pulled back towards the multi-layered Hindenburg Line of fortresses. In mid-April, portions of the ninth Battalion were in the thick of the battling against a noteworthy German counter-assault at Lagnicourt.

Amid the move to the begin line, the two conveying and "wiping up" organizations of the unit were gotten in an overwhelming and steady German blast, endured critical losses and ended up muddled. More out of control Neligan sent back his aide to re-arrange them, and they got through the German shell shoot to their get together positions. 

Albeit at first expected as the third rush of the detachment assault, the second wave twelfth Battalion had moved to one side because of the German blast, and the tenth viably joined the second wave to its right side. The tenth had additionally pushed ahead to stay away from the substantial flood, and had moved toward becoming intermixed with the main wave framed by the eleventh Battalion.

At the point when the detachment authority was murdered, the South Australians "went frantic" as per Wilder-Neligan, slaughtering as opposed to catching the greater part of the German battalion. At the point when the primary goal was achieved, Wilder-Neligan had his force fill the hole in the line to one side of the twelfth Battalion. When the two conveying and "wiping up" organizations achieved the second target, Wilder-Neligan left them there to dive in. Amid a delay in the fight while his two "storm" organizations were holding on to go ahead to the third target, Wilder-Neligan had uncommonly obtained duplicates of the "Day by day Mirror" and "Day by day Mail" papers conveyed for his men to peruse. With the assistance of the substantial crawling blast, the third goal was immediately taken. Amid the fight, the unit endured 207 losses. On the day following the fight, he was charged by a London paper as "The Eccentric Colonel", because of his conveyance of papers to his holding up troops.

On 30 May, the tenth Battalion directed an effective task to catch a few German posts forward of the line close Merris, enduring 64 losses. In the wake of accomplishing its destinations, the force warded off two German counter-assaults. An advancement utilized by Wilder-Neligan amid this task was a battery of rifle grenadiers framed from cooks and different base camp staff, who gave close help to the attacking troops. The force was complimented by the military corps, division and unit leaders for its work. 

In June, Wilder-Neligan was named a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George for his work as boss of the tenth Battalion from September 1917 to February 1918. On 28 June, he was wiped out with flu yet at the same time on obligation when an open door for "quiet infiltration" of the German channels emerged. Coordinated to direct a showing before Merris, where the tenth Battalion held the bleeding edge, Wilder-Neligan exploited the going with torrent to energize his two line organizations to catch propelled German posts. He strengthened their underlying accomplishment by requesting that the two organizations proceed with their development, and at the same time raised the greater part of his help and hold organizations to help. The development was secured by a smoke torrent set somewhere around channel mortars and rifle projectiles. More out of control Neligan's nearby coordination of a big guns flood behind the German posts helped the legion push considerably further forward. Before the day's over, the tenth Battalion had caught of German line, alongside 35 detainees, six assault rifles and two channel mortars, for the loss of around 50 setbacks. His activity done, Wilder-Neligan then announced wiped out. This time, the force got congrats from the military and armed force corps officers.

Distinctively, all alone activity, Wilder-Neligan drove solid watches forward on his flanks with an end goal to wrap the town. He had made some progress, and trusted that the catch of the town was unavoidable when an overwhelming German torrent plummeted on the force station line. The new divisional authority, Major General William Glasgow, presently wound up mindful of Wilder-Neligan's activity, and, as Wilder-Neligan couldn't ensure correspondence with his flanking watches because of the flood, Glasgow requested the tenth Battalion to pull back. In his report on the activity, Wilder-Neligan noticed that somewhere in the range of 60 and 70 Germans had been slaughtered and four detainees taken, for the loss of two murdered and seven injured. As to task, he announced that, "a definitive withdrawal in dutifulness to the request of the Divisional Commander not the slightest bit moderated its prosperity". 

After seven days, he was allowed the chance to demonstrate the insight of his arrangement to catch Merris. The evening of 29 July, under front of an unequivocally arranged crawling blast that worked its way through Merris and past it, he sent two organizations, totalling around 180 men, on uniting lines of assault from the upper east and southwest of the town. Following an hour of deliberately planned cannons, automatic weapon and channel mortar support, he sent his central station unit into the broke town to "mop-up" any residual obstruction. At its decision, the activity had caught the town, encompassing it with a progression of firmly held posts, and had caught 188 Germans for the loss of 35 setbacks, just four of whom were murdered. Slope expresses that the catch of Merris was "maybe [Wilder-Neligan's] most prominent accomplishment". 

The investigator general of preparing for the British Expeditionary Force depicted the catch of Merris as "the best show at any point done by a contingent in France". More out of control Neligan was granted a bar to his Distinguished Service Order for this "creative and brave activity". The reference read: 

In August, Wilder-Neligan drove his contingent amid the early battling of the Hundred Days Offensive, which started on 8 August 1918 with the Battle of Amiens. Amid the battling for Lihons on 10 August, he brought his legion up into close help utilizing an eccentric technique. He pushed ahead of his unit, conveying a flagging light on his back, utilizing it to transmit requests to his unit to stop or progress. By this technique he brought his force into a situation from which it could bolster his old unit, the ninth, with just a single setback. From his propelled position, he could see that the flank of the ninth had been held up, and he sent his most grounded organization to aid the catch of CrÃ©pey Wood. 

On the next day, 9 August, Wilder-Neligan was set in direction of his very own power comprising regiment and the twelfth Battalion for the catch of Lihons itself. Regardless of overwhelming fog, he demonstrated his reasonable handle of the strategic circumstance when he understood that German counter-assaults were exploiting a hole between the forward troops, and immediately cleared it utilizing supporting troops.

More out of control Neligan's reasonable strategic discernment was joined by persevering endeavoring to guarantee the necessities of his men were met. As indicated by Hill, "over all he was a coordinator, some said the best in the AIF". Bean noticed that he was "an anxious and bold soul", "a rash, thrill seeker officer, yet free of the inconsiderateness with which those characteristics are frequently related", "a gay, wild youthful Englishman, cunning fighter, and definitely a pioneer wherever he was", and an "inconsistent authority". 

He had numerous whimsical propensities, and frequently humiliated his officers through his activities.
