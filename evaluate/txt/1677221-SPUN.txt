Gloucestershire Regiment 

The Gloucestershire Regiment, normally alluded to as the Glosters, was a line infantry regiment of the British Army from 1881 until 1994. It followed its sources to Colonel Gibson's Regiment of Foot brought up in 1694, which later turned into the 28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot. The regiment was framed by the merger of the 28th Regiment with the 61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot. It acquired the one of a kind benefit in the British Army of wearing an identification on the back of its hood just as the front, a respect won by the 28th Regiment when it battled in two positions consecutive at the Battle of Alexandria in 1801. At its development the regiment included two customary, two civilian army and two volunteer contingents, and saw its first activity amid the Second Boer War. 

Prior to the First World War, the regiment's four assistant units were changed over to three Territorial Force contingents and a save brigade, and a further 18 legions were added to the regiment's foundation amid the war. Sixteen brigades of the regiment saw dynamic administration in France and Flanders, Italy, Gallipoli, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia and Salonika, losing an aggregate of 8,100 men executed and winning 72 distinctive fight respects. Four honors of the Victoria Cross (VC) were made to warriors presenting with the regiment. The wartime units were disbanded as the war finished, and just before the Second World War, two of the regional contingents were re-purposed and stopped to have any association with the regiment. On the eve of the war, the staying regional unit was copied, and another five forces were raised on the flare-up of war, however the vast majority of these were disbanded or re-purposed as the war advanced. Four brigades saw dynamic administration under the regiment's hues amid the war. The second and fifth Battalions both battled in the Battle of France and, in the wake of being lost nearly completely amid the Battle of Dunkirk, the re-framed second Battalion arrived at Gold Beach on D-Day and battled in the Allied crusade in North-West Europe. The first Battalion was associated with the retreat from Rangoon amid the Japanese success of Burma, and the tenth Battalion saw dynamic administration in the thrashing of Japanese powers amid the Burma Campaign 1944â 45. 

After the Second World War, the threats just forces were disbanded and the first and second Battalions were amalgamated, leaving the regiment with one standard and one Territorial Army brigade. It accomplished notoriety amid the Korean War when the first Battalion waited for three evenings against overpowering chances amid the Battle of the Imjin River. The stand, depicted by the authority of the United Nations powers in Korea at the time as "the most exceptional case of unit dauntlessness in present day war", kept the encompassing of other United Nations powers, for which the regiment was granted the Presidential Unit Citation and earned the moniker "The Glorious Glosters". Two men presenting with the regiment were granted the VC for their activities in the fight. In the last 50% of the twentieth century, the regiment was decreased to a solitary customary contingent and finished voyages through obligation around the globe, including Germany, Africa, the Caribbean, Central America and the Middle East, just as in Northern Ireland amid The Troubles. Soon after commending its tercentenary in 1994, the regiment, which conveyed more fight respects on its hues than some other regiment of the line, was converged with the Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment to shape the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment. The new regiment acquired the back identification, and when it also was converged in 2007, it passed the convention on to its successor, The Rifles. 

The Gloucestershire Regiment followed its underlying foundations to Colonel Gibson's Regiment of Foot, brought up in 1694 in Portsmouth, which originally observed activity in 1705 amid the War of the Spanish Succession. Having been told by, and in this manner named after, a progression of colonels, the regiment was renamed in 1742 as the 28th Regiment of Foot and battled under this name amid the War of the Austrian Succession. Another forerunner, the 61st Regiment of Foot, was shaped in 1758 when the British Army was extended amid the Seven Years' War. The 61st Regiment picked up its first fight respect a year later amid the attack of Guadeloupe, that year that General Wolfe set himself at the leader of the 28th Regiment on the Plains of Abraham in the catch of Quebec. 

In 1782, the British Army started connecting foot regiments with regions for the motivations behind enlistment. Out of the blue the area of Gloucestershire was related with both the 28th and 61st Regiments, which were renamed as the 28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot and the 61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot. The two regiments started to enroll from the province, and it was in Gloucester in December 1782 that the 61st Regiment was given new hues to supplant those lost amid the Franco-Spanish intrusion of Minorca prior that year. 

In March 1801, the 28th Regiment framed piece of the British expeditionary power that arrived at Aboukir Bay in Egypt to contradict Napoleon's Army of the East. On 21Â March, amid the Battle of Alexandria, French mounted force got through the British lines, framed up behind the regiment, and started to charge. With the men still vigorously drew in to their front, the request was given for the back position to turn about, and standing in this way in two positions consecutive, the regiment effectively held the line. For this activity the 28th Regiment was agreed the novel benefit of wearing the regimental number both on the front and the back of its crown. The 61st Regiment additionally sent to Egypt and, in spite of the fact that arriving past the point where it is possible to have a functioning influence, was, similar to the 28th Regiment, granted the fight respect "Egypt" and the privilege to show the Sphinx on its hues. 

Amid the nineteenth century, moderately uneventful postings at home and abroad were punctuated with times of dynamic administration. The 28th and 61st Regiments both battled in Spain and Portugal amid the Peninsular War. The 28th Regiment additionally partook in the last annihilation of Napoleon; it was lauded by the Duke of Wellington for courage in the Battle of Quatre Bras and saw activity again in the Battle of Waterloo. In the mid-nineteenth century, the two regiments were sent to India, and the 61st Regiment saw dynamic administration amid the Second Anglo-Sikh War and the Indian Mutiny, including "Chillianwallah", "Goojerat", "Punjaub" and "Delhi 1857" to the rundown of fight respects that the Gloucestershire Regiment would before long acquire. The 28th Regiment, whose time in India was shorter and less exciting, was in the mean time sent to the Crimea and included "Alma", "Inkerman" and "Sevastopol" to its inheritance. 

Another string that would be woven into the account of the Gloucestershire Regiment is that of the regular citizen regulated helper powers which upheld the military in the midst of need. In the mid-eighteenth century, region state armies were raised for home protection and as a pool of stores for the ordinary armed force. By 1760, Gloucestershire had raised two regiments of civilian army, and these were sorted out in 1763 as the South Gloucestershire Militia based at Gloucester and the North Gloucestershire Militia at Cirencester. In 1859, region based volunteer rifle corps were raised, prompting the development of the first (City of Bristol) Gloucestershire Rifle Volunteers and the second Gloucestershire Rifle Volunteers. 

In 1872, the Cardwell Reforms started the way toward sorting out the British Army along region lines dependent on two-unit line infantry regiments, a procedure that was finished by the Childers Reforms nine years after the fact. Subsequently, the 28th and 61st Regiments were amalgamated in 1881 to shape the Gloucestershire Regiment, headquartered at Horfield Barracks in Bristol. The changes additionally added the province's helper powers to the regiment's foundation, and at its development it in this way contained two ordinary, two state army and two volunteer brigades: 

The Gloucestershire Regiment acquired from the 28th Regiment the benefit of wearing the back identification. It was a benefit that the second Battalion did not need, yet it was made agreeable to the previous 61st Regiment by supplanting the number 28 with the Sphinx, a fight respect granted to both ancestor regiments. Albeit the two contingents were compelled to surrender their individual confronting hues on their uniformsÂ â yellow for the 28th Regiment and buff for the 61st RegimentÂ â when the administration forced a standard white over all English and Welsh regiments, the Gloucestershire Regiment never acknowledged this change for their regimental hues. The two units held their previous hues until 1929, when a trade off primrose yellow was at last picked and another regimental shading consequently displayed. 

The two forces kept on alluding to themselves by their previous regimental numbers until they were converged in 1948, when the Gloucestershire Regiment turned into a solitary brigade regiment. The first Battalion commended the bicentenary of the regiment at Malta in 1894 and the commemoration of the Battle of Alexandria every year. The second Battalion, then again, held amusements pursued by a supper and a ball on the commemoration of the 61st Regiment's triumph at Chillianwallah on 13 January 1849 when abroad, or on the commemoration of that regiment's triumph at Salamanca on 22 July 1812 when at home. 

The new regiment procured its walk, "The Kinnegad Slashers", and its official epithet, "Slashers", from the 28th Regiment. The name emerged from an occurrence in 1764, when individuals from the regiment supposedly cut off piece of the ear of a Montreal judge who had been badgering fighters positioned in the city after the Seven Years' War. The regiment was likewise here and there alluded to as "The Old Braggs", from Colonel Philip Bragg, who instructed the 28th Regiment when it was still named after its colonels. Two different epithets related with the new regiment were acquired from the 61st Regiment; "The Flowers of Toulouse", from the red garbs of that regiment's numerous dead in the Battle of Toulouse, and "The Silver-Tailed Dandies", from the silver designs on the more extended than-typical coat tails of the 61st Regiment's uniform. 

The Gloucestershire Regiment started life discreetly. The two legions shifted back and forth between postings at home and abroad, for the most part in India, yet their first activity came in 1899 amid the Second Boer War. Conveyed to Ladysmith, the first Battalion was a piece of a section conveyed on 24Â October to cover the withdrawal of a detachment after the Battle of Talana Hill. At the point when the segment experienced harsh criticism close Rietfontein, the contingent was confined and requested forward, yet the request was uncertain and the legion progressed excessively far. The troops were gotten in the open for a few hours before they had the capacity to remove themselves at the expense of five men killed, including the contingent authority, and 58 injured. 

After five days, about 450 men of the first Battalion were a piece of a little power entrusted with catching Nicholson's Nek, a pass some north of Ladysmith, amid the Battle of Ladysmith. The troops moved out the evening of 29Â October with the goal to be in position before the principle fight began, however they left past the point where it is possible to achieve their target before dawn. As they took up an elective position on the close-by Tchrengula Hill the pack-donkeys catapulted, taking the majority of the overwhelming weaponry and ammo with them. The Boers found the invasion at sunrise and encompassed the position, and despite the fact that the British waited for a few hours they were compelled to surrender at 12:30. The regiment lost 38 executed and 115 injured, and the survivors were held as detainees of war (POWs) in Pretoria. 

While the rest of the first Battalion helped in the barrier of Ladysmith (the city was in the end mitigated on 1Â March), the second Battalion sent to South Africa, landing in January 1900.

On 15Â March, the force entered the Boer city of Bloemfontein, where it stayed on army obligations until 1904. The first Battalion, re-joined when its POWs were freed after the catch of Pretoria on 5Â July, was presented in August 1900 on Ceylon, where it stayed until 1903 guarding Boer detainees of war.

They served for a year close by the second Battalion and were supplanted by a second volunteer organization in April 1901. The fourth (Militia) Battalion, in the interim, watched Boer detainees hung on St. Helena. By the war's end the regiment had lost 2 officers and 94 different positions slaughtered, 13 officers and 201 men injured, and experienced 250 passings ailment. The regiment added 4 new fight praises to its hues: "Resistance of Ladysmith"; "Alleviation of Kimberley"; "Paardeberg"; and "South Africa, 1899â 1902"; the remainder of which was additionally granted to the first and second Volunteer Battalions. 

Following the finish of the war in South Africa, the first contingent moved in late 1902 from Ceylon to British India, where it was presented on Lucknow. 

Following the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907Â â piece of the Haldane Reforms which rebuilt the British Army and changed over the civilian army and volunteer legions into the Special Reserve and the Territorial ForceÂ â the fourth (Militia) Battalion was disbanded, and at the episode of the First World War in 1914 the Gloucestershire Regiment involved:

It went energetically on 11Â September, when it effectively struck the Railway Triangle west of Auchy, and saw its keep going activity on 18Â September, when a German assault drove A Company from its forward posts. The contingent was disbanded in June 1919. 

The "Fifth Gloucester Gazette" was a channel diary distributed from the cutting edges by the men of the 1/fifth Battalion. The primary issue showed up on 12Â April 1915 and foreshadowed progressively well known channel diaries, for example, "The Wipers Times". It kept running for 25 issues, the remainder of which showed up in January 1919. After the war it was republished as an assemblage titled "The Fifth Gloucester Gazette an account, genuine and funny, of the Battalion while presenting with the British Expeditionary Force". The paper highlighted jokes, verse, short stories, news and mocking adverts. In October 1916 "The Times Literary Supplement" hailed it as "the most established and most scholarly of the British channel diaries". 

The paper was respected so profoundly due to a limited extent to the endeavors of renowned war writer and establishing supporter F. W. Harvey, who distributed 77 sonnets in it while presenting with the 1/fifth. Five of Harvey's sonnets were incorporated into the 1917 compilation of war verse, "The Muse in Arms", close by lyrics by Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves and Rupert Brooke. The collection additionally highlighted the verse of Lieutenant Cyril WinterbothamÂ â who served in the 1/fifth Battalion and altered the journal until he was slaughtered in real life on 27Â August 1916Â â and Harvey's pre-war companion Ivor Gurney, who served in the 2/fifth Battalion. 

All second-line regional and New Army legions had been disbanded and the regiment came back to its pre-war foundation before the finish of 1919. Near 40,000 men are accepted to have battled with the regiment in the war, of which 8,100 lost their lives, and the regiment was granted 72 diverse fight praises. The standard regiments lost 1,400 men executed, 1,044 of them from the first Battalion, and were granted 39 fight distinctions. The regional contingents lost 2,542 men slaughtered and got 60 fight distinctions, and the New Army units endured 3,954 passings and won 84 fight distinctions. Locally situated save units and the regimental station represented 204 passings. Four honors of the VC were made to men presenting with the regiment amid the war, alongside 47 Distinguished Service Orders (DSO), 188 Distinguished Conduct Medals (DCM), 265 Military Crosses (MC) and 747 Military Medals (MM). A fifth VC was granted to an officer of the regiment appended to another unit. 

After the finish of the First World War, the regiment continued interchange postings home and abroad. The first Battalion finished voyages through obligation in Ireland, where it caught the Irish republican SeÃ¡n Moylan, and Germany, which considered a home posting, and came back to the UK in 1923. Then, the second Battalion was presented on India, with a five-month break in Shanghai at short notice from February 1927 while warring Chinese groups compromised the Shanghai International Settlement. In 1928, the second Battalion came back to the UK and the first Battalion was posted abroad, serving three years in Egypt, a year in Singapore and six years in India before winding up in Burma in 1938. Incited by worries of an Italian attack following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, the second Battalion was sent at short notice to Egypt in January 1936, coming back to the UK in January 1937. The next year, the fifth Battalion turned into the regiment's sole regional unit when the fourth Battalion was changed over to the 66th Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery (RA), and the sixth Battalion changed over to the 44th Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment. On the eve of the Second World War, the Territorial Army (TA), as the Territorial Force had been renamed, was multiplied in size, and the seventh Battalion was made in August 1939 as the second-line copy of the fifth Battalion. 

On the flare-up of the Second World War in 1939, the Gloucestershire Regiment involved: 

The second Battalion sent to France on 2Â October 1939 and was exchanged to the 145th Brigade in the 48th Division in March 1940. This acquired it close by the fifth Battalion the division's 144th Brigade, which had touched base in France on 15Â January 1940. In May 1940, amid the Battle of France, the German leap forward at Sedan hastened a retreat to Dunkirk. The fifth Battalion walked in 83 hours with little nourishment or rest before in the long run getting transport at Tournai where, on 19Â May, the second Battalion lost 194 men killed or missing in only minutes to an airstrike. The regiment increased some rest on 20Â May, when the two legions held positions along the River Escaut (Scheldt) for two days before the British Expeditionary Force continued its retreat. On 25Â May, the second Battalion, having at this point endured 219 losses, turned out to be a piece of Somer Force. This blended gathering of units under the direction of Brigadier Nigel Somerset, as of not long ago the second Battalion boss, invigorated Cassel on the external border around Dunkirk. The Germans tested the town the following day and started striking it on 27Â May. Somer Force waited for two days, in the end endeavoring to pull back compelled on the night of 29Â May, however few made it to Dunkirk. The second Battalion endured 678 setbacks at Cassel, 484 of them POWs. In the interim, the fifth Battalion was given a comparative assignment at the towns of Arneke and Ledringhem, some north-west of Cassel. The force took up positions on 26Â May, and the principal assaults came the following day. By 28Â May, the force had assembled at Ledringhem, where it was encompassed, and it pulled back compelled in the early long stretches of 29Â May. The survivors achieved Bray Dunes before day break the following day and were in this manner removed the shoreline by little ships. The remain at Ledringham had cost the contingent 87 murdered, and when it reassembled in the UK it was 400 in number. 

In March 1942, the first Battalion gave the rearguard to the British retreat from Rangoon amid the Japanese victory of Burma. It saw its first noteworthy activity of the war on 7 and 8Â March at the Taukkyan Roadblock, and for the remainder of the month worked freely to cover the retreat, battling fights at Letpadan on 17Â March and Paungde on 27Â March. In an ensuing fight close Padigong, from Paungde, D Company wound up secluded for 17 hours and needed to battle its way back to the unit at Shwedaung. Meanwhile, the regiment turned out to be a piece of the 63rd Indian Infantry Brigade in the (seventeenth Infantry Division), which needed to battle its approach to and through Shwedaung when Japanese powers penetrated between the rearguard and the principle section. Before the finish of March, the first Battalion had been decreased to 140 all positions, its leader, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Bagot, among the injured. 

In mid-April, the under-quality regiment turned out to be so scattered while securing devastation parties at oil establishments around Yenangyaung and Chauk that when Bagot came back from emergency clinic he was educated the force had stopped to exist. He was all things considered ready to accumulate the remainders, presently numbering 7 officers and 170 different positions, at Shwebo on 27Â April, and the force was in this manner strengthened by a draft of 3 officers and 120 different positions. At the point when the Japanese compromised Monywa, Bagot took order of the considerable number of troops in the territory, which incorporated the first Battalion, to shape Bagot Force. This blended gathering of units battled a deferring activity at Budalin, north of Monywa, on 4Â May before pulling back to Ye-u. The regiment kept on going about as rearguard, crossing the River Chindwin at Kalewa on 9Â May and into India at Tamu toward the month's end. In the meantime, the Japanese stopped activities in Burma. Since the beginning of the retreat from Rangoon on 7Â March the legion had lost 8 officers and 156 different positions slaughtered in real life or passed on of disorder, and a lot progressively injured. The force was refreshed and conveyed back up to quality in India, where it spent the rest of the war, and saw no further activity. 

On its arrival to the UK, the fifth Battalion was conveyed back up to quality and kept an eye on beach front protections in Cornwall. It changed over to an observation job in June 1941, in the long run turning into the 43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment, and from October it stopped to have any connection with the Gloucestershire Regiment. Its copy, the seventh Battalion, was presented on Northern Ireland, however observed no activity and turned into a preparation unit in 1944. With such a large number of its men mulling in POW camps, the second Battalion was remade and served in home protection at different areas around the UK, at long last winding up in 1943 on the Isle of Wight before being allocated to a progressively dynamic job. 

As the UK prepared itself for Operation Sea Lion, the German intend to attack, various home safeguard legions were raised under the regiment's hues. The eighth Battalion was framed from the National Defense Companies and comprised of men excessively old, excessively youthful or unfit for dynamic administration, and the more youthful unexpected from this legion later shaped the 70th Battalion. The ninth and tenth Battalions were likewise raised, the previous serving in Northern Ireland, the last in south Wales and after that Lincolnshire. The eleventh Battalion was made in October 1940 from a re-assignment of the 50th (Holding) Battalion, and 32,000 men in 19 forces of the Home Guard wore the identifications of the regiment. As the risk of attack subsided, a large portion of these home safeguard contingents were disbanded, the eighth and 70th in 1942, the ninth in 1943, and the Home Guard in 1945. In February 1942, the eleventh Battalion stopped to have any association with the regiment when it was changed over to the 118th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment of the Royal Artillery. The tenth Battalion was changed over to defensive layer in 1942 and turned into the 159th Regiment in the Royal Armored Corps, however it held the Glosters' top identifications. It was sent to India in October where, in March 1943, it changed over back to infantry and returned to the regiment's tenth Battalion. 

In 1944, the second Battalion was exchanged to the 56th Independent Infantry Brigade, and at 11:00 on 6Â June, amid the Normandy arrivals, the detachment arrived without occurrence in the second wave at Gold Beach. The brigade saw activity in the Battle of Normandy: at Tilly-sur-Seulles on 11Â June amid Operation Perch; along the Saint-Germain d'Ectot edge on 30Â July amid Operation Bluecoat; and at Thury-Harcourt on 12Â August in the prelude to Operation Tractable. In mid-August, having differently served under the directions of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, the seventh Armored Division and the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, the 56th Brigade went under order of the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, with which it stayed for the remainder of the war. Amid the development to the River Seine, the second Battalion endured 53 losses catching Ãpaignes on 25Â August, and crossed the waterway at Rouen on 2Â September. It led the attack on Le Havre eight days after the fact, and it was the principal British unit to enter the city's fortress, on 12Â September, catching 1,500 detainees and much brew for the misfortune amid the clash of 40 men killed and injured. 

From Le Havre, the second Battalion progressed into Belgium, seeing activity in the bridgehead over the Turnhout-Antwerp Canal, and the Netherlands, where it battled at Stampersgat. The legion achieved Nijmegen in late November, where it spent more than four moderately calm months hindered just by a four-day fight at Zetten in January 1945. The contingent's last huge activity of the war went ahead 12Â April, when it struck over the River Ijssel at Arnhem, after which the remainder of the 56th Brigade went through to catch the town itself. Following the German surrender on 8Â May, the second Battalion entered Germany close OsnabrÃ¼ck. It gave a separation to the British watchman at the Nuremberg preliminaries, and in August it was exchanged to the fifth Guards Brigade positioned in Berlin. Between the Normandy arrivals on 6Â June 1944 and VE Day on 8Â May 1945 the force endured 718 setbacks. Among them was the brigade authority, Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Butterworth, kicked the bucket of wounds got amid the assault at Stampersgat and prevailing by Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Bray. 

On returning to the infantry job, the tenth Battalion was doled out to the 72nd Brigade in the 36th Infantry Division. The division was bound for Burma, and therefore the regiment "having been prepared as infantry, tank troops, and joined activities troops, went straight into wilderness fighting, for which we had no preparation". The Glosters landed on the Arakan Peninsula (present day Rakhine) in February 1944, were a piece of the aid project in the Battle of the Admin Box, and battled in scattered, organization scale activities in the catch of the Mayu passages and Hambone Hill. The division went into save in May and was carried to Myitkyina in July, exchanging toward the Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC) under the American General Joseph Stilwell. It pushed south along the Mandalay railroad and caught Taungni on 9Â August, amid which period the tenth Battalion lost a bigger number of men to disorder than foe activity. Conveyed back up to quality in September, the force was occupied with four days of savage battling at Pinwe in November, losing every one of the officers in both An and C Companies, and everything except one in B Company, before being alleviated on 26Â November. 

The 36th Division proceeded with its development south in January 1945, and the tenth Battalion saw activity in a progression of short fights around Mabein that month. The legion saw its last activity of the war supporting the 26th Indian Brigade assault at Myitson on the River Shweli, amid which D Company was cut off for five days before the remainder of the force had the capacity to connect up with it on 16Â February. Of the 250 or so men in the regiment before the fight, 119 were killed or injured when the Japanese pulled back on 17Â February. Despite the fact that the men had battled well, there were unpleasant recriminations over the direct of the fight between the administrator of the 26th Brigade, Brigadier M. B. Jennings, and the tenth Battalion's leader, Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Butler, which brought about Butler being sacked. Subsequent to achieving Mandalay, the contingent came back to India in May, and was disbanded at Poona in December 1945. 

The regiment accumulated 20 distinctive fight praises and lost 870 men killed in the nine forces that had served under its hues amid the Second World War. Just the two standard contingents stayed with the regiment at the war's end, however the regional fifth Battalion was come back to the hues on 1Â March 1947 and doled out to the 129th Infantry Brigade of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division. That equivalent year, the first Battalion was diminished to a framework and came back from India to the UK, and the second Battalion was presented on Jamaica and separated organizations to Bermuda and British Honduras (cutting edge Belize). It was in Jamaica that, as per the rebuilding of the British Army, the regiment's two units swapped hues and amalgamated to shape the single-legion Gloucestershire Regiment (28th/61st) on 21Â September 1948. 

After its arrival to the UK in 1949, the first Battalion, instructed by Lieutenant-Colonel James Power Carne, was relegated to the 29th Independent Infantry Brigade Group, and on 3Â November 1950, after the flare-up of the Korean War, the contingent landed with the unit in Korea. Toward the start of December, the 29th Brigade gave the rearguard amid the general retreat that pursued the United Nations (UN) rout at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River. On 16Â February, after UN powers propelled a counter-hostile, the GlostersÂ â with help from the 25-pounders of the 45th Field Regiment RA, the mortars of the 170th Heavy Mortar Battery and direct flame from 17 Centurion tanks of the eighth King's Royal Irish HussarsÂ â effectively attacked Hill 327, south of the River Han, for the loss of 10 executed and 29 injured. 

Right off the bat in April, the 29th Brigade, upheld by the 45th Field Regiment RA and under order of the United States (US) third Infantry Division, took up dissipated positions on a front in Line Kansas along the Imjin waterway. The 657 men of the first Battalion's battling part, upheld by C Troop 170th Heavy Mortar Battery RA, were daintily spread on the detachment's left flank in positions set back some from the waterway, guarding a passage close to the town of Choksong. Organization A held Castle (Hill 148) disregarding the passage, D Company was at Hill 182, toward the south-east, and B Company was at Hill 144, toward the east of D Company. Organization C was for possible later use close Hill 314, ignoring regiment home office (HQ) and Support Company at Solma-Ri. The unit's second-in-direction, Major Digby Grist, was with back home office ("F echelon") some behind, on highway Five Yankee (5Y) to Seoul. There was a hole between the Glosters and the first Battalion Royal Northumberland Fusiliers to their right side, and to their left side the twelfth Regiment of the South Korean (ROK) first Infantry Division was away. 

After dusk on 22Â April, the Chinese propelled the Spring Offensive, the primary period of which was intended to wipe out the US third Division, the 29th Brigade and the ROK first Division. Achievement would enable them to assault the US 24th and 25th Divisions in the flank and leave the route open to Seoul. Against the four legions of the 29th Brigade the Chinese had amassed the 63rd Army, containing the 187th, 188th and 189th Divisions; somewhere in the range of 27,000 men in 27 infantry legions. 

At 22:00, a 17-man watch from C Company in position on the stream bank, bolstered by the weapons of the 45th Field Regiment, connected with the main Chinese troops multiple times as they endeavored to cross the passage. The watch pulled back without misfortune when they started to come up short on ammo and the striking troops at long last picked up the contrary bank. Amid the night, the Glosters' forward organizations were assaulted, and by 07:30, A Company, dwarfed six to one, had been constrained from Castle Hill. An endeavor to retake it fizzled, and the organization, presently at not exactly half quality and with all officers executed or injured, fell back to Hill 235. The withdrawal left D Company's position uncovered and, with one of its companies seriously battered in the medium-term battling, it excessively resigned to the slope. Organization B had not been squeezed amid the night, however the withdrawal of D Company to its left side and the Fusiliers on its correct left the organization uncovered, and it fell back to Hill 314, east of C Company. Toward the evening, Major Grist was with the legion HQ amid a break in the battling, having thought of provisions, when news came through of an assault on the F echelon position. He drove back along course 5Y, through a snare and past a gathering of F echelon troops coating the street under Chinese gatekeeper, inevitably achieving the unit HQ. The loss of the F echelon position implied that the legion was presently cut off. 

At 23:00 on 23Â April, the Chinese continued their assault, tossing the crisp 189th Division against the Glosters' B and C Companies around Hill 314. During that time the men of B Company, driven by Major Edgar Harding and dwarfed 18:1, persevered through six attacks, bringing in big guns individually position to separate the remainder of them. Low on ammo and having taken numerous setbacks, the seventh ambush at 08:10 constrained them from their position, and only 20 survivors made it to Hill 235, to which the legion HQ, Support and C Companies had officially pulled back. With the Glosters' position still essential to the honesty of Line Kansas, Carne got orders at 07:00 on 24Â April from the third Division leader, General Soule, to persevere. He was prompted that fortifications, including tanks of the eighth Hussars and Philippine tenth Battalion Combat Team and the troops of the Glosters' own back echelon, were being sent up course 5Y. The protective layer got to inside of the Glosters' situation before being stopped in a trap around 15:00, sentencing the Glosters to one more night alone on Hill 235. 

By the evening of 24Â April, the Glosters, with C Troop 170th Mortar Battery presently battling nearby as infantry, had been decreased to a successful battling power of 400â 450 men. They were low on ammo, however to support them the 45th Field Regiment gave astounding help. Appraisals of the contradicting power go from a regiment (three forces) to a division (three regiments). The Glosters battled during that time of 24â 25Â April, amid which the pinnacle was quickly involved by the Chinese, along these lines undermining the Glosters' entire position on the slope. It was recovered in a counter-assault driven by the aide, Captain Anthony Farrar-Hockley, and the Chinese propelled seven assaults in a single hour trying to take it once more, all without progress. Their strike on the slope was at long last separated after dawn via airstrikes. That morning, with Chinese powers penetrating miles behind the lines, UN powers started to pull back to Line Delta. On Hill 235, the Glosters had next to no ammo, no expectation of help and, with the 45th Field Regiment progressing, no big guns support. Carne got consent to endeavor a breakout at 06:05. He had no real option except to leave the injured, evaluated at somewhere in the range of 100. The survivors split into little gatherings and endeavored to sidestep the Chinese encompassing them to achieve agreeable lines. Only 63 men made it. 

The Glosters' stand had connected an expansive hole the 29th Brigade's front on Line Kansas which would some way or another have left the flanks of the ROK first and US third Divisions helpless. Their quality likewise compromised the back of the Chinese powers as they progressed and prevented them the utilization from claiming courses south for their cannons and donkey trains. General James Van Fleet, administrator of the US Eighth Army, depicted the remain as "the most extraordinary case of unit courage in current war", and in a letter to General Ridgeway, president of UN powers in Korea, he composed that "the loss of 622 officers and men spared ordinarily that number". The 29th Brigade officer, Brigadier Thomas Brodie, initiated the regiment "The Glorious Glosters", a sobriquet that was rehashed in the features of the day, and Hill 235 wound up known as "Gloster Hill", at the foot of which the Gloucester Valley Battle Monument was worked in 1957. 

Different regiments of the 29th Brigade had likewise been occupied with edgy battling, however without a similar size of misfortunes, and altogether the unit endured 1,091 losses. Of the Glosters' 622 setbacks, 56 were executed and 522 were taken prisoner, some of whom had just persevered through the POW camps of Germany and Japan. Carne, himself taken POW and right now a beneficiary of the DSO for his initiative amid the prior fight at Hill 327, was granted the VC and the American Distinguished Service Cross. Lieutenant Philip Curtis, connected from the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, was after death granted the VC for his activities amid the endeavor to retake Castle Hill. Two honors of the DSO were made, to Harding and Farrar-Hockley, and six MCs, two DCMs and ten MMs were likewise granted. Lieutenant Terence Waters, appended from the West Yorkshire Regiment, was after death granted the George Cross for his lead amid imprisonment. The regiment itself, alongside C Troop 170th Heavy Mortar Battery, was granted the Presidential Unit Citation. 

The unit's quality on 26Â April was 119 men, for the most part back echelon troops who had been a piece of the aid venture however not generally engaged with the fight. This figure rose to 217 later in the day as men came back from leave and those rare sorts of people who had figured out how to escape from Hill 235 rejoined. The 29th Brigade was conveyed back up to quality in May, and the regiment came back to the line along the Imjin in September. It was eased in November and came back to a turbulent welcome at Southampton on 20Â December. The POWs were likewise invited back to incredible pomp following their discharge in 1953. The Korean War represented 113 fatalities among the Glosters, 36 of them in bondage. 

While the Korean War proceeded, the regiment was occupied with increasingly stately issues at home. It lined the course of King George VI's memorial service parade on 15Â February 1952, and it was given its first hues at a function in Gloucester on 26Â April, the two standard contingents having held those of their ancestor regiments up to that point. On 2Â June 1953, 400 men from both the first and fifth Battalions participated in the parade at the crowning ordinance of Queen Elizabeth II. Somewhere in the range of 1955 and 1994, the regiment came back to increasingly military obligations, generally watching the contracting British Empire with voyages through obligation in Kenya, Aden, Bahrain, Cyprus, Belize, Gibraltar and the African states of Swaziland, Mauritius, Bechuanaland and Basutoland. The regiment likewise took an interest in the British commitment to NATO in Germany, serving three visits with the British Army of the Rhine and two with the British battalion in Berlin, and somewhere in the range of 1968 and 1991 it finished seven visits in Northern Ireland amid The Troubles, in which it lost five men murdered. 

In March 1967, the first Battalion turned into the sole unit of the Gloucestershire Regiment when, because of a rearrangement of the TA, the fifth Battalion turned into A Company of the Wessex Volunteers in the Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve. The regiment barely maintained a strategic distance from amalgamation with the Royal Hampshire Regiment in 1970, and it praised its tercentenary toward the beginning of March 1994; 300 years since the raising of Gibson's Regiment of Foot. However, at that point, the disintegration of the Soviet Union had incited the administration to rebuild the military. Subsequently, the Gloucestershire Regiment was amalgamated with the Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment to shape the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment. The new regiment kept up the back identification custom, and when it was thus amalgamated in 2007, it passed the convention on to its successor regiment, The Rifles, who wear the back identification with their stately uniform. The Glosters marched once and for all on 26Â March 1994 in Gloucester. The hues, conveying more fight respects than some other regiment of the line, were then walked to the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum, and the regiment pursued the 28th and 61st Regiments of Foot into history. 

Coming up next were granted the Victoria Cross, Britain's most astounding honor for dauntlessness, while presenting with the Gloucestershire Regiment: 

Daniel Burges, an impermanent Lieutenant-Colonel in the Gloucestershire Regiment, was granted the VC amid the First World War while instructing the seventh Battalion South Wales Borderers. 

The accompanying served in the formal position of Colonel of the Regiment:
