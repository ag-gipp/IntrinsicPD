The beginning stage is the town of Far Harbor. The Island, where numerous remarkable animals live, is covered by radioactive haze. Since the animals that live inside the haze are reluctant to go anyplace without it, the town utilizes gadgets called mist condensers to transform the mist into fluid so as to ensure its occupants. 

There are three noteworthy clashing groups present in the extension, all dwelling in discrete territories: the Harbormen of Far Harbor; the synth (manufactured people) state of Acadia; and the Church of the Children of Atom. The Harbormen of Far Harbor are driven by the town chief, Captain Avery, and try to recover The Island from the mist that has progressively determined them out of their homes. The Children of Atom live in an old atomic submarine base called the Nucleus and are driven by High Confessor Tektus. Tektus is an obsessive supporter of the Church of Atom who tries to cripple or decimate the mist condensers. The asylum for the synth province of Acadia is a surrendered research focus at the highest point of The Island; the gathering are driven by a puzzling model synth called DiMA. DiMA is well disposed to both the Harbormen and the Children inasmuch as Acadia stays self-sufficient and disengaged from the remainder of the world. 

Valentine's Detective Agency gets a solicitation for assistance from Kenji and Rei Nakano, a couple living in a remote corner of the Commonwealth: their little girl, Kasumi, has evaporated suddenly and completely or clarification. The Sole Survivor is sent to explore, finds Kasumi had been in contact with Acadia and gets Kenji's pontoon to pursue her. Touching base in the town of Far Harbor, the Sole Survivor finds The Island secured a strained stalemate between the nearby occupants and the Children of Atom. With the guide of a neighborhood seeker and one of the Harbormen named Old Longfellow, the Sole Survivor discovers Kasumi living in Acadia. Kasumi has come to trust that she is a synth, and has looked for asylum in Acadia, despite the fact that she has begun to question the goals of DiMA. At Kasumi's command, the Sole Survivor changes center to exploring DiMA, and step by step learns he has intentionally put away a portion of his recollections on hard drives outside of his body. He has shrouded them inside a PC reenactment in the Children of Atom's base, the Nucleus, yet has developed progressively worried that if the Children get to the recollections, they will have the way to demolish Far Harbor. The Sole Survivor approaches the Children of Atom to recoup DiMA's recollections and discovers that he set up a progression of safeguards to ensure Acadia, and to save the equalization of intensity between Far Harbor and the Children of Atom. These are the entrance codes to an atomic warhead, put away inside the Nucleus, and the way to undermine the mist condensers ensuring Far Harbor. The Sole Survivor likewise finds that DiMA killed Captain Avery and supplanted her with a synth to keep up harmony between Far Harbor and Acadia. 

There are eight conceivable endings. The Sole Survivor is looked with a decision: to wreck Far Harbor, to annihilate the Children of Atom, or to educate the general population of Far Harbor of DiMA's wrongdoing and trigger a quarrel between the Harbormen and Acadia. Should the player explode the warhead, the Harbormen will assume responsibility for the island, while if the player crushes the haze condensers, the Children will wind up prevailing. In the two situations Acadia will be saved, however DiMA will object to the player's activities. Then again, if the player stands up to DiMA over Avery's homicide, Acadia may end up antagonistic. The Sole Survivor can build up a progressively lasting harmony between all gatherings by killing or pursuing endlessly High Confessor Tektus, and permitting DiMA to supplant him with a synth who will receive an increasingly moderate position towards the Harbormen. The Sole Survivor can make the primary groups mindful of Acadia's presence. Assuming this is the case, The Institute, a logical association that made the synths, will send operators to recover the synths, while the Brotherhood of Steel, a semi religious association established in the United States Armed Forces, will dispatch a campaign to eradicate them. The Railroad, a gathering restricted to the presence of The Institute with the point of liberating aware synths, will send an employable to reach Acadia, however the last will dismiss their assistance. 

In the outcome, the Sole Survivor comes back to the Nakano family back in the Commonwealth. Kasumi, contingent upon the player's decisions, may come back with the player character or remain in Acadia.
