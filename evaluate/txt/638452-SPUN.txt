"The Age of Kings" centers around structure towns, gathering assets, making armed forces and at last vanquishing adversaries by pulverizing their units and structures. Players vanquish rival towns and realms as they advance one of 13 civic establishments through four "Ages": the Dark Age, the Feudal Age, the Castle Age (being the High Middle Ages), and the Imperial Age, reminiscent of the Renaissanceâa 1000-year time allotment. Progressing to another Age opens new units, structures, and advancements, yet players should initially fabricate certain structures from their present age and afterward pay an entirety of assets (normally nourishment and gold). 

Non military personnel units, called "townspeople", are utilized to assemble assets; they are either male or femaleâsexual orientation does not influence their capacities. Assets can be utilized to prepare units, develop structures, and research innovations, in addition to other things; for instance, players can examine better reinforcement for infantry units. The amusement offers four sorts of assets: nourishment, wood, gold, and stone. Nourishment is gotten by chasing creatures, gathering berries, collecting domesticated animals, cultivating, and shore angling and angling from pontoons. Wood is assembled by cleaving down trees. Gold is gotten from either gold mines, exchange or gathering relics in a religious community, and stone is gathered from stone mines. Residents require checkpoints, normally safe structures (town focus, mining camp, plant, and timber yard), where they can store assembled assets. 

Every human advancement can buy overhauls that expansion the rate of social event these assets. Players can build a commercial center for exchange; players can exchange wood, stone, and nourishment for gold, and utilize gold to purchase different assets. Market costs change with each exchange. Besides, markets and docks can likewise produce gold by utilizing exchanging trucks or machine gear-pieces which are utilized to visit outside business sectors and ports; when they come back to the player's market/dock, gold is added to the reserve. The measure of gold an exchange unit wins on each excursion is identified with the separation it needed to go to an outside market; progressively gold is earned on longer treks. It is conceivable to exchange with foes' business sectors or docks, yet the player's exchanging units might be assaulted or obliterated by adversary units all the while. Players don't have to continue exchanging physically, as once they select the port or market the exchanging units interminably keep on exchanging. 

There are five battles in "The Age of Kings", containing truly based situations, for example, Genghis Khan's attack of Eurasia, Barbarossa's Crusade, or Saladin's resistance of the Holy Land. In the Joan of Arc and William Wallace crusades, the player can control a unit dependent on its namesake; in others, players take orders from managing spirits illustrative of the military's officer. 

Extra diversion modes are accessible to the player in "The Age of Kings". One mode, irregular guide, produces a guide from one of a few arbitrarily picked guide creating contents, with players beginning in the Dark Age with a Town Center, three locals (or additionally relying upon development), and a scout unit. The diversion can be won through military success, by developing an exceptional structure known as a Wonder and keeping it representing a specific measure of time, or by acquiring control of all relics on the guide for a set measure of time. Deathmatch mode enables players in the first place a lot of assets, making an attention on military predominance, while in the regicide mode every player is given a ruler unit, winning by murdering the majority of the different rulers. 

Each player has a farthest point to the quantity of units they can makeâa populace limitâhowever may not promptly utilize the whole potential populace. The populace limit, which can be topped at anyplace somewhere in the range of 25 and 200 in interims of 25, depends on the quantity of houses, Castles, or Town Centersâthe principle working in a player's townâwhich have been constructed. "The Age of Kings" presented two noteworthy new highlights for unit the executives: the inactive resident catch, which enables players to distinguish locals that have not been allocated an undertaking, and the town chime, which sends each of the a player's townspeople into their Town Center, Castle, or tower for security; units garrisoned inside these three structures, particularly bowmen, increment the structure's capability (towers fire more bolts with units garrisoned inside) including the town focus, which can't fire anything at all without somebody garrisoned there. 

"The Age of Kings" likewise incorporates five kinds of military units: infantry, toxophilite, rangers, attack weaponry, and maritime units. Particular sorts of infantry, bowmen, and mounted force are "counter units" with extraordinary safeguards against different kinds of units. The three human classes of military by and large pursue a stone paper-scissors demonstrate. For instance, infantry are commonly ground-breaking against structures however powerless against rangers, hence the infantry counter unitsâspearmen and pikemenâhave assault rewards against mounted force. 

Every Civilization in "The Age of Kings" has a couple of uncommon units that are select to that Civilization. For example, the Britons approach longbowmen, an arrow based weaponry unit with expanded range. These Civilization-explicit units are commonly progressively ground-breaking, yet at the same time pursue the essential shake paper-scissors display. The priest is an extraordinary sort of military unit that can change over foe units to the player's human progress, and to mend associated units. Priests are additionally used to gather relics. Relics amass gold once held in the player's cloisterâthe more relics are caught, the quicker the gold is aggregated. Gathering all relics on the guide is one technique by which a player can win an irregular guide diversion, contingent upon the triumph setting. When a player has every one of the relics in their cloisters, a clock is appeared all players. On the off chance that a contradicting player does not demolish a religious community holding a relic after the set time, at that point that player wins. 

Players play as one of 13 developments split into four structural stylesâWestern European, Eastern European, Middle Eastern, and East Asianâthat decide building appearance in-amusement. The human advancements have shifting qualities and shortcomings concerning financial aspects, innovation, and fight, and every ha access to at least one extraordinary, ground-breaking "Special Units". Moreover, every human advancement gives an individual group reward in group recreations. To change it up, every human progress has a lot of sound chomps in its local language that are expressed by units when chosen or trained to play out an undertaking.

The most imperative financial structure is the Town Center, where residents are made, a wide range of assets can be put away, a few advances are looked into, and the player can progress to the following Age. The Town Center can fire bolts at foe units inside range if residents or bowmen are garrisoned while enduring an onslaught. Other monetary structures accessible incorporate capacity structures for assets, ranches, docks (the dock may likewise create a few military ships), and houses to help a higher populace. 

Military structures incorporate unit-delivering structures, for example, dormitory, arrow based weaponry ranges, stables, and strongholds, just as protective structures, for example, dividers and towers. Military structures can perform research to improve the capacities of military units, expanding their quality, guarded abilities, or different properties. Palaces are a key hostile and guarded structure as they can construct trebuchets, train the development's "interesting unit/s", and flame a hail of bolts at foe units inside range, with garrisoned units terminating additional bolts. Strongholds must be worked after a player has achieved the Castle Age, in spite of the fact that in some amusement alternatives, players start with an effectively manufactured chÃ¢teau as ahead of schedule as the Dark Age. 

In the wake of progressing to the Imperial Age, players can likewise develop a Wonder, an incredibly costly non-military structure. On numerous interactivity modes, constructing a Wonder triggers a triumph commencementâexcept if it's crushed inside a certain time allotment, the structure player wins. Each progress' Wonder is in the state of a milestone special to that verifiable cultureâthe Temple of Heaven for the Chinese, for instance, or Notre Dame for the Franks.
