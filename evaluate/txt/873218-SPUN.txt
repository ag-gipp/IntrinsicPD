Trescothick was submerged into cricket since the beginning. His dad, Martyn, played two counterparts for Somerset's Second XI and was a decent novice player, showing up for Bristol and District Cricket Association somewhere in the range of 1967 and 1976. They played together in focused Western League matches while his mom, Lin, made the club teas. He was taught at the Sir Bernard Lovell School in Oldland Common close Bristol, where his remarkable scores for the school were remunerated with a Somerset contract in 1993. He was nicknamed "Tresco" and "Banger", the last getting from his eating regimen as a youthful player: 

My eating regimen was hotdogs at that point, in no specific request, frankfurters, chips, wieners, toast, hotdogs, beans, wieners, cheddar, wieners, eggs, and the intermittent wiener.

His vocation total of 1,032 keeps running for England U-19 is second just to John Crawley's 1,058. 

Trescothick was not as effective in local cricket in 1995, in spite of the fact that there were still a few features including an innings of 151 against Northamptonshire (33% of his season's aggregate), and a cap trap, including the wicket of century-creator Adam Gilchrist, for Somerset against Young Australia. Trescothick's England Under-19 structure was as yet brilliant, averaging 74.62 with the bat in six matches. His Under-19 partners would frequently taunt him for wearing an England overcoat after his matches; Trescothick would answer by saying that "it may be the nearest I get to playing for England". 

The accompanying five years were blended for Trescothick. Averaging around 30 runs for each innings, he was regularly scrutinized for an absence of foot development. David Gower portrayed Trescothick's procedure by saying "he doesn't have to move far however needs to move enough. When he is playing great ... he is truly adept at exchanging weight. When he isn't playing great, his feet stall out". Nonetheless, Trescothick was granted the NBC Denis Compton Award for Somerset's most encouraging youthful district player in the 1996 and 1997 seasons. In 1997, Somerset Second XI were set 612 to win by Warwickshire Second XI, and Trescothick scored 322 to bring the Seconds to 605. 

In 1999, Trescothick inspired Glamorgan mentor Duncan Fletcher in a province coordinate at Taunton, by scoring 167 out of a low-scoring match where the following most noteworthy innings was 50. At the point when England opening batsman Nick Knight supported finger damage in 2000, Fletcher, who had been delegated England mentor, approached Trescothick to make his England debut in the NatWest Series against Zimbabwe and the West Indies. Trescothick's normal determination for England implied that he was seldom accessible for household choice somewhere in the range of 2000 and 2006, regularly playing just a couple of matches for Somerset toward the beginning of the period. 

Trescothick took an interest in two England A visits amid the winter of 1999, however his full One Day International introduction came against Zimbabwe at The Oval on 9 July 2000, when he scored 79. He proceeded with his great structure in the competition with a Man of the Match-winning 87 not out against the West Indies at Chester-le-road, storing up 288 keeps running at a normal of 48.00 and taking two wickets against Zimbabwe at Old Trafford. 

Because of his great structure in the NatWest arrangement, Trescothick was given his Test coordinate presentation later that mid year in the third Test against the West Indies at Old Trafford. He showed a quiet demeanor when England lost early wickets, scoring 66 and shaping an organization of 179 with Alec Stewart. Writer Thrasy Petropoulos saw that there was "balance and durability...just as there had been venture and verve to his great begin in the one-day field." He finished the Test arrangement with a normal of 47.50. 

Britain started the 2000â 2001 winter visit with the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy at Nairobi Gymkhana Club. Trescothick did not score very in the competition, and England were thumped out at the quarter-last stage against South Africa. Trescothick was named the Professional Cricketers' Association Player of the Year for his exhibitions for Somerset all through 2000. 

Trescothick's lady global century came against the Sindh Governor's XI in October 2000, amid the primary warm-up match to the Pakistan arrangement. Trescothick achieved his most noteworthy score (71) of the three Test coordinates in the opening innings of the principal Test. He stepped through his sole Examination wicket in the third Test, when Ashley Giles got the Pakistan opener Imran Nazir. 

Trescothick began the Sri Lanka visit with a century against a Sri Lanka 'Colts XI'. He was the top scorer in the two innings of the primary Test with 122 and 57, in spite of the fact that this was eclipsed by Marvan Atapattu's 201 not out in Sri Lanka's innings. Trescothick arrived at the midpoint of 41.33 in the Test arrangement, however just 16.00 in the three resulting ODIs. 

Britain played two Test matches against Pakistan in June 2001. Despite the fact that Trescothick scored 117 in the second Test, it was insufficient for England to win the match. His ODI structure improved toward the beginning of the 2001 NatWest Series against Australia and Pakistan, with scores of 69 and 137 separately. Nonetheless, his arrangement finished with two back to back ducks, and England lost every one of their matches in the competition. 

Despite the fact that Trescothick was England's second most elevated run scorer in the 2001 Ashes arrangement, he showed an inclination to give his wicket away when "well set". Britain lost the arrangement 4â 1, with most of the England batsmen's commitments being eclipsed by Mark Butcher's 173 not out to win the fourth Test. Trescothick's evident failure to make significant scores was again obvious in the 2001â 02 One Day International arrangement in Zimbabwe, where he just passed 50 on one event regardless of scoring reliably. He likewise captained the side without precedent for this arrangement, delegating for the harmed Nasser Hussain. 

Trescothick truly made his mark on the winter voyage through India in 2001. The three-Test arrangement saw him averaging 48.00, with a most noteworthy score of 99. He was England's best batsman in the ODI arrangement, averaging 53.00 with a strike rate of more than 100. He scored a century in the first ODI, despite the fact that England lost by 22 runs. He built up a notoriety for keeping his self-control while the remainder of the group were fizzling; now, none of Trescothick's four global hundreds of years had brought about an England win. He was likewise man-of-the-coordinate in the last ODI, setting up an England triumph, with 95 keeps running from 80 balls. This visit built up Trescothick's notoriety for being a standout amongst England's best batsmen against turn bowling: as indicated by David Gower, he was "making a decision about line and length great". "Indian Cricket" named him one of their five Cricketers of the Year for 2002. The accompanying voyage through New Zealand was less fruitful for Trescothick, just once achieving twofold figures in a poor ODI arrangement, combined with a normal Test coordinate execution. 

Trescothick had been playing admirably in 2002, scoring 161 in the Sri Lankan arrangement and being granted the Player of the Series in the tri-country NatWest Series (counting a century in the last), until his season was stopped when he broke his thumb while handling. He returned for the fourth Test against India, scoring two half-hundreds of years. Trescothick had blended fortunes in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy; he pursued his century in the NatWest last with a man-of-the-coordinate winning 119 against Zimbabwe, yet neglected to score as England lost to India and left the competition. 

In October, Trescothick was one of 11 players granted "focal contracts" by the ECB, which remunerate a player's district for their absence of residential appearances. 

Trescothick was dominated by Michael Vaughan amid the 2002â 03 Ashes arrangement, averaging just 26.10 with a top score of 72 in contrast with Vaughan's normal of 63.30 and three centuries. Trescothick found the middle value of 31.60 crosswise over 10 coordinates in the VB Series, yet England were outflanked by Australia all through the visit. Trescothick neglected to exceed expectations in the 2003 World Cup as England neglected to fit the bill for the thump out stages. In his five matches, Trescothick's top score was 58 against Namibia, with a competition normal of 23.20. 

Trescothick played well against a powerless Zimbabwe side in the two-Test arrangement in Mayâ June 2003, and scored an unbeaten century in the three ODIs against Pakistan averaging more than 100. His structure proceeded in the 2003 NatWest Series, with 114 not out against South Africa. The opening stand with Vikram Solanki of 200 runs was the most noteworthy first-wicket association for England and gave the principal occurrence of both England openers scoring a very long time in similar innings. Trescothick kept up his structure in the South Africa Test coordinates; a vocation best 219 at The Oval finished a fruitful arrangement in which he found the middle value of 60.87. 

In Bangladesh, scores in the nineties against both the President's XI and Bangladesh A were trailed by a century in the main Test, and 60 in the second. He scored one 50 years in the three ODIs, in spite of the fact that England just utilized five batsman in the agreeable triumphs. Britain played inadequately against Sri Lanka, with Trescothick thinking that its difficult to manufacture an expansive innings. He endeavored to assume responsibility for the match with 70 at Colombo, as England attempted to get something from the arrangement, but on the other hand was censured for his poor getting. 

His structure in the visit toward the West Indies in March and April 2004 was blended. After a few low scores in the Test arrangementâTrescothick began with just 20 keeps running from his initial five inningsâhe achieved two half-hundreds of years, yet neglected to make a generous match-winning commitment. This poor visiting structure may have been the beginning of the inconveniences that would lead him out of universal cricket later on. Trescothick stated, "The hardest thing for me has been the pitches. So far nets and the matches have been all things considered surfaces and runs have been hard work...In England you become accustomed to great practice surfaces so the musicality of batting comes quite simple [sic]." However, he bested the England batting midpoints in the 7-coordinate one-day arrangement, with 267 runs incorporating 130 in the fifth ODI and 82 from 57 balls in the seventh. 

Back in England, Trescothick was called upon to chief England after Michael Vaughan continued knee damage. Albeit other England skippers had appeared to endure an absence of batting structure, the additional expert did not influence Trescothick, and he manufactured a decent organization with debutant Andrew Strauss against New Zealand. This understanding created in the second Test with a first-wicket organization of 153; Trescothick proceeded to score 132, his 6th Test century. Trescothick's organizations with Strauss were to average 52.35 in 52 innings. His first century against the West Indies followed in the second Test, and Trescothick turned into the principal player to make a very long time in the two innings of a Test coordinate at Edgbaston, and the ninth England player to score a century in every inning of a Test coordinate. Trescothick was again England's best One Day International batsman in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, scoring 261 keeps running in only four innings, incorporating a century in the last; he additionally took his fourth ODI wicket. 

The 2004â 5 voyage through Zimbabwe made a few players voice their worries about the Robert Mugabe routine, the security issues in the nation, and the standard of the Zimbabwean side. Steve Harmison was the first to blacklist the visit for "political and brandishing reasons", and Flintoff was accounted for to think about taking an ethical stand himself. The England Chairman of Selectors David Graveney denied that the selectors would forget players discontent with visiting Zimbabwe and would put their nonattendances down to damage. Flintoff and Trescothick were, be that as it may, "rested" permitting Kevin Pietersen to make his introduction. 

Trescothick utilized an opportunity to get ready for the accompanying arrangement in South Africa, even took up yoga in endeavor to reinforce his exhibitions abroad. In December 2004, he made 85 not out against a N.F. Oppenheimer XI in South Africa. An organization of 152 with Strauss in the opening Test against South Africa was trailed by an association of 273 in the second, in which they both scored more than 130. This was a record opening association at Durban and England's initial 200 opening stand since Gooch and Mike Atherton in 1991. Prior to this, the contrast between his home and abroad normal was more than 20, and his third abroad century went far to counter this. Concerning his visiting troubles, Trescothick expressed "I wouldn't state I've put it to rest, however I've made a major advance forward to putting it to rest. It's a psychological fight for me, something I need to manage and strive to attempt to comprehend what is unique. He made a further improvement with a considerably bigger score of 180, as England won the fourth Test. Subsequent to batting gradually with Ashley Giles, the fall of Hoggard's wicket soon thereafter prodded Trescothick to begin "releasing savage shots", setting up an impossible triumph with Steve Harmison banding together him. In the matches going before the 2005 Ashes arrangement, England wrapped up two simple triumphs against Bangladesh. Trescothick scored 194 in the main Test, and 151 in the second. He likewise scored 100 not out against Bangladesh in his 100th ODI, outperforming Gooch's record of eight ODI hundreds of years for England. 

Trescothick fared preferable in 2005 over in the past Ashes arrangement, turning into the second most noteworthy run scorer in the arrangement (behind the productive Kevin Pietersen). Amid the third Test, he turned into the quickest player to achieve 5,000 keeps running in Test cricket, and furthermore accomplished the eminent accomplishment of scoring more than 1,000 Test keeps running in a schedule year for the third back to back year: 1,004 out of 2003, 1,003 out of 2004, and 1,323 of every 2005. He additionally had the questionable respect of getting to be both Glenn McGrath's 500th and Shane Warne's 600th Test wicket amid the arrangement. Trescothick was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year for his accomplishments in 2005, and was granted a MBE in the 2006 New Year praises list with the remainder of the English group. 

For the Test arrangement against Pakistan, Trescothick was offered the captaincy afresh because of damage to Vaughan. He was uncertain whether to acknowledge yet understood that as "informal second in command...I trust it was the correct thing to venture up. It is energizing to figure I could be in control for a couple weeks...I know there is an opportunity I perhaps won't be a one-coordinate miracle this time â it could be the entire arrangement, yet being near Michael, I've seen the things it [captaincy] does to you." As it unfolded, Trescothick scored 193 in the principal innings (in spite of the fact that England lost the match), and Vaughan returned for the second Test. Trescothick had considered leaving the visit early when his dad in-law had a genuine mishap, yet remained in Pakistan as individual opener Andrew Strauss returned home to go to the introduction of his first kid. 

Amid England's voyage through India in February 2006, Trescothick suddenly returned home refering to individual reasons. He later accused an infection. 

Trescothick came back to Test cricket in May, scoring 106 against Sri Lanka to turn into the primary Test centurion of the 2006 English season. The century turned out to be the high purpose of Trescothick's Test summer, be that as it may, as he achieved 50 years only once in the ensuing six Tests against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. This keep running of structure was lifted later in the year by two ODI hundreds of years, one each against Ireland and Sri Lanka. In September, he pulled back from the remaining ODIs against Pakistan and approached not to be considered for the prospective ICC Champions Trophy squad in view of a pressure related disease. It was later accepted likely that Trescothick had been experiencing clinical misery, which was likewise the reason for quite a bit of his inconvenience all through 2006. 

Returning by and by to the global field, Trescothick was incorporated into the squad for the 2006â 07 Ashes in Australia, and played in the initial two visit matches against the Prime Minister's XI and New South Wales. On 14 November, following the match against New South Wales, England declared Trescothick was flying home due to a "repeat of a pressure related sickness". Geoffrey Boycott later expressed that despondency among cricketers is once in a while recorded, yet with the current clogged ICC plan, player "burnout" and comparable sicknesses were ending up increasingly typical. 

Trescothick's vulnerability over his place in the England squad drew shifted analysis. Notwithstanding, he likewise gotten help from regarded players, including Somerset skipper Justin Langer, Alec Stewart, Mike Gatting, and Bob Woolmer. 

Trescothick finished some theory about his global profession by declaring that he might want to be considered for a spot in the national side later on. Britain's administration staff kept on supporting him, and named him in the underlying 25-man squad for the 2007 Test arrangement against the West Indies. Having recouped from a twofold hernia task, and substantiating himself fit for the beginning of the area season, Trescothick started his rebound to cricket by scoring 256 from 117 balls in a 50 over match against Devon on 8 April 2007, helping Somerset to 502â 4 off their 50 overs. 

His rebound to the County Championship proceeded with a 44-ball 50 years against Middlesex on 19 April 2007, while in May he hit a profession best 284 against Northamptonshire, despite the fact that Trescothick expressed then that he didn't feel prepared for a universal Test coordinate position. Trescothick pursued this twofold century with a thump of 76 off 35 balls against Northamptonshire, with five fours and seven sixes. 

Discussion over Trescothick's place in the England squad proceeded in the midst of a finish of-arrangement reshuffle in the England batting lineup. This incorporated the dropping of individual opener Strauss from the one-day side, and the ascent of Alastair Cook as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick expressed that he would perceive how he advances before focusing on the universal scene: "obviously I'd love to play for England once more... Plainly, in the event that I need to proceed with my vocation I need to attempt another visit. However, for the present, if and when I return to full wellness and I think I am OK and prepared to play, I'll make myself accessible for England." He included that he was "edgy to play for England once more" yet was holding up until he was "as persuaded as I can be that I am prepared to assume the test of worldwide cricket". 

In July 2007, Trescothick was named in the primer squad for the Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa, with the full squad to be affirmed on 11 August. Notwithstanding, Trescothick hauled himself out of the squad before the last affirmation date, expressing that "[I am] now evident that I should set aside more effort to finish my recuperation". The England selectors affirmed that they stayed for including Trescothick sooner or later, looking "forward to his creation himself accessible again for England when everything looks good". Trescothick, in any case, said that he realizes England can't hang tight for him everlastingly, and on 10 September 2007 he went into his second year without an England contract. 

In the mean time, his great household structure proceeded with a quick 146 and 69 not out amid a four-day coordinate against Northamptonshire, giving Somerset an impossible triumph. A score of 49 from 83 balls followed in the four-day coordinate against Nottinghamshire, and a score of 84 from 79 balls against Durham was trailed by a man-of-the-coordinate winning 124 which saw Somerset elevated to the principal division of the NatWest Pro40. Of his 2007 season, Somerset chief of cricket Brian Rose expressed that Trescothick had made "fantastic advancement". Trescothick kept up productive structure all through the season in spite of foot damage, scoring 1,343 keeps running at a normal of 61.04 to direct Somerset to the Division 2 title. He was granted an advantage year in 2008, after on from effective medical procedure on a harmed metatarsal. He stays firm, in any case, on his choice to avoid the England group for his wellbeing. 

On 15 March 2008, Somerset declared that Trescothick had chosen to haul out of the district's pre-season voyage through the UAE in the wake of enduring a repeat of his condition, driving numerous to theorize that, given this most recent difficulty, it appeared to be expanding improbable that Trescothick would speak to England once more. Somerset's executive of cricket Brian Rose, in any case, expressed that he didn't "see the misfortune as a noteworthy issue" and that Trescothick would most likely play for Somerset in the accompanying season, and "for a long time" after. He could stay away for the indefinite future to universal dimension, be that as it may, and reported his retirement from global cricket on 22 March 2008. He expressed that he had "attempted on various events to make it back to the global stage and it has demonstrated much more troublesome than [he] expected" and rehashed his craving to keep playing household cricket. He later expressed that it was his choice to pull back from Somerset's voyage through Dubai that provoked his choice. 

Accordingly, Angus Fraser expressed: "Clearly, it is miserable to see such a committed, energetic and agreeable man compelled to surrender something that plainly implied such a great amount to him, yet the inward torment that accompanied endeavoring to conquer the psychological sickness that kept him from visiting with England for over two years must be finished. It was doing Trescothick and his family nothing more than trouble by any stretch of the imagination. Speaking to your nation is a wellspring of immense pride, however there are unquestionably progressively vital things throughout everyday life". Fraser likewise expressed: "It was in Pakistan that Marcus Trescothick's psychological instability started to mix and the opener has not played an abroad test since". 

After a fantastic residential season for Somerset, incorporating 184 of every a 40-over match against Gloucestershire (his most elevated List A score), Trescothick discharged his personal history, "Returning to Me", on 1 September 2008, clarifying that he had experienced uneasiness assaults since the age of 10, and that playing household cricket implied that, consistently, he was just ever three hours from his family. He stated, 

The book has been broadly lauded for its genuineness, with Trescothick's challenges drawing examination with Harold Gimblett's comparable emotional well-being issues. In spite of endeavors by Pietersen to lure Trescothick once again into the England set-up, Trescothick affirmed that his choice has been made and that he is putting his wellbeing and family first. In November 2008 "Returning to Me" was named the 2008 William Hill Sports Book of the Year. In April 2009, Trescothick diverted down another solicitation from new England commander Andrew Strauss to consider making himself accessible for England's World Twenty20 Championship battle. 

Trescothick proceeded with his profession with Somerset into 2009, having gotten an advantage year from his region, just as another remain in his name. Amid his advantage year he arrived at the midpoint of 46.59 in the 4-day amusement, including three centuries, and he began 2009 with 52 against Warwickshire. It was additionally reported on 20 April 2009 that Trescothick has turned into a supporter of Anxiety UK, following the disclosures of his account.

He additionally performed well in the one day field, taking Somerset to the last of the Twenty20 title while proceeding to dismiss any proposals of returning for the last Test of the 2009 Ashes arrangement. He completed the season as the main run scorer in the County Championship, scoring 1,817 runs. With the flight of Justin Langer, Trescothick was named as Somerset commander from 2010 onwards. 

Trescothick was likewise named Most Valuable Player by the Professional Cricketers' Association for his 2,934 keeps running in all rivalries in the 2009 season, 1,745 of these in the County Championship. Over the winter he featured in a short film to advance Somerset, appointed by internal venture office Into Somerset. 

With Somerset sprinters up in the English 2009 Twenty20 Cup, Trescothick and his district ventured out to India to share in the Champions League Twenty20 in October. In spite of the fact that both Kieswetter and Hildreth were foreseen as triumphs, it was Trescothick who was portrayed as having "been in shining structure all season" and started the competition under media examination given his past troubles playing on visit. There was much hypothesis with respect to any "repeat of his pressure related disease that initially happened in 2006", as this was to be his first abroad trip since a prematurely ended endeavor in 2008. Trescothick himself reacted to the media by creating an impression to the BBC World Service which read "I know the hazard and I recognize what happens when it turns out badly. In the last couple of times I have endeavored to go on visit it's flopped, so obviously [it is a risk]... How about we attempt and break the convention of what has occurred in the course of the last couple of times... I can just attempt. It's a major challenge for the players and for the club. I must attempt and get it going." Meanwhile, Langer guaranteed the media that Trescothick could destroy out at whatever point he wished to. Somerset, who started the visit without Trescothick as he was arriving later than a large portion of the squad, initiated their warm up with a triumph over the Otago Volts. The opener arrived three days after the fact, sure about his capacity to finish the visit. Somerset started with a nearby triumph against the Deccan Chargers on 10 October, winning from the last ball. Trescothick was rejected for 14 from 12 in his first match outside England since 2006, "in the wake of offering a brief look at his ability" as indicated by ESPNcricinfo. 

Trescothick was unfit to maintain a strategic distance from a repeat of his past troubles when voyaging abroad, in any case, and returned home on 15 October, refering to the equivalent "stress related sickness". Brian Rose, who Trescothick had moved toward at first after Somerset's annihilation by Trinidad and Tobago on 12 October, discharged an announcement to the media expressing "Marcus conceded two or three days back that he wasn't 100% with the goal that's sufficiently reasonable. I think his future will be in local cricket and that may even assist him with this specific type of disease. I thoroughly consider the following a few years you'll see Marcus Trescothick performing magnificently well in province cricket." Michael Vaughan, who had by then resigned from cricket, adulated Trescothick's "bold" choice, as did Vikram Solanki, at that point PCA executive. Writer Andrew Miller required a conclusion to the rising analysis of Trescothick's choice from general society, while Paul Hayward of the "Gatekeeper" additionally disparaged those condemning of the Somerset player's activities. Regardless of returning home, Trescothick kept on avowing his pledge to the club by marking another three-year contract with discretionary fourth year, in December. He was named commander for the 2010 season. 

Trescothick drove Somerset into the 2010 season as commander, and started firmly in the County Championship with a century and four half-hundreds of years from his initial eight diversions, however he battled in the recently shaped Clydesdale Bank 40 with just 95 keeps running from the initial five matches, and in the Friends Provident T20 173 keeps running at 21.62 with a best of 50.

Somerset earned record monetary returns that year, however again bombed in the semi-last and last phases of every single significant challenge. 

Over every one of the three arrangements, Trescothick took 2,518 keeps running for his area. ESPNcricinfo's George Dobell noted in their finish of season round-up that "He keeps on commanding area assaults such that just Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash â of ongoing batsmen â could coordinate. There are times when he makes the bowlers' activity seem outlandish."
