SMS "Schwaben" ("His Majesty's Ship "Swabia"") was the fourth ship of the of pre-man of war ships of the German Imperial Navy. "Schwaben" was worked at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven. She was set down in 1900, and finished in April 1904, at the expense of 21,678,000 imprints. Her sister ships were , and ; they were the primary capital boats worked under the Navy Law of 1898, advocated by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. "Schwaben" was furnished with a principle battery of four firearms and had a top speed of . 

"Schwaben" burned through the majority of her profession as a gunnery preparing ship from 1904 to 1914, however she as often as possible took an interest in the huge scale armada practices amid this period. After the beginning of World War I in August 1914, the ship was activated with her sisters as the IV Battle Squadron. She saw restricted obligation in the North Sea as a watchman send and in the Baltic Sea against Russian powers. The danger from British submarines constrained the ship to pull back from the Baltic in 1916. For the rest of the war, "Schwaben" filled in as a building preparing ship for naval force cadets. She was held by the Reichsmarine after the war and reactivated from 1919 until June 1920, filling in as a terminal ship for F-type minesweepers in the Baltic. The ship was stricken from the naval force list in March 1921 and sold for rejecting in that year. 

After the German "Kaiserliche Marine" (Imperial Navy) requested the four s in 1889, a blend of budgetary requirements, restriction in the "Reichstag" (Imperial Diet), and an absence of a cognizant armada plan deferred the procurement of further warships. The Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt" (Imperial Navy Office), "Vizeadmiral" ("VAdm"â Vice Admiral) Friedrich von Hollmann battled all through the early-and mid-1890s to verify parliamentary endorsement for the initial three s, however in June 1897, Hollmann was supplanted by "Konteradmiral" ("KAdm"â Rear Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz, who immediately proposed and verified endorsement for the principal Naval Law in mid 1898. The law approved the last two boats of the class, just as the five boats of the , the top of the line of ship worked under Tirpitz's residency. The "Wittelsbach"s were extensively like the "Kaiser Friedrich"s, conveying a similar combat hardware yet with an increasingly complete protective layer format. 

"Schwaben" was long generally speaking and had a light emission a draft of forward. The ship was controlled by three 3-chamber vertical triple development motors that drove three screws. Steam was given by six water-cylinder and six barrel shaped coal-terminated boilers. "Schwaben"s powerplant was appraised at , which produced a top speed of . She had a team of 30Â officers and 650Â enlisted men. 

"Schwaben"s combat hardware comprised of a principle battery of four 24Â cm (9.4Â in) SK L/40 weapons in twin firearm turrets, one fore and one toward the back of the focal superstructure. Her auxiliary combat hardware comprised of eighteen 15Â cm (5.9Â inch) SK L/40 and twelve 8.8Â cm (3.45Â in) SK L/30 fast shooting firearms. The deadly implement framework was balanced with six torpedo tubes, all submerged in the body; one was in the bow, one in the stern, and the other four were on the broadside. Her shielded belt was thick in the focal segment that secured her magazines and hardware spaces, and the deck was thick. The fundamental battery turrets had of defensive layer plating. 

"Schwaben"s bottom was laid 15 September 1900, at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, under development number 27. She was requested under the agreement name "G", as another unit for the armada. "Schwaben" was propelled on 19 August 1901; amid the starting service, King Wilhelm II of WÃ¼rttemberg gave a discourse and his better half Queen Charlotte of WÃ¼rttemberg initiated the ship. She was authorized on 13 April 1904, the last ship of her class to enter dynamic administration. The ship's cost totaled 21,678,000 imprints 

There was a disagreement about where "Schwaben" ought to be appointed after her dispatching in April 1904. Chief of naval operations Hans von Koester, the armada authority, needed the ship to be appointed to the dynamic obligation squadron, however Tirpitz needed to utilize the new warship as a preparation vessel, since the Training Squadron just had cruisers and outdated boats. Tirpitz won the discussion, thus "Schwaben" was to supplant the antiquated ironclad frigate in the Training Squadron. There, she was to fill in as a torpedo preparing ship. On 18 May, "Schwaben" withdrew Wilhelmshaven and went through the Skagerrak to the Baltic Sea, touching base in Kiel on 22 May. 

While on ocean preliminaries, she struck an unknown shore off the northern tip of the island of Fehmarn. The effect harmed a length of the ship's body and holed it in a few spots. After fixes were finished, she continued her preliminaries, which endured until the finish of 1904. The preliminaries were hindered by the yearly harvest time moves, amid which "Schwaben" joined the dynamic armada in the North Sea. On 11 January 1905, she was formally allocated to the Training Squadron, yet as a big guns preparing boat to supplant the old vessel . The ship was situated in Sonderburg in the Baltic, alongside the reinforced cruisers and , and a few other preparing ships. She started a yearly daily practice of gunnery preparing in the western Baltic that was hindered just by yearly gunnery drills with the whole High Seas Fleet in October. Amid these armada works out, "Schwaben" was bolstered by the delicate . "Schwaben" additionally went into drydock from the finish of October to the center of December consistently for occasional support. 

"Schwaben" partook in activities in the SwinemÃ¼nde Bay in April and May 1906, and the yearly armada gunnery drills occurred off Helgoland in August. Her yearly update was finished ahead of schedule, in November. In March 1907, "Schwaben" took part in gunnery preparing with the armada. She joined the leader of the Reserve Squadron, the seaside guard dispatch , for moves off the bank of Farther Pomerania in July. The next month, "Schwaben" filled in as the leader of "VAdm" Hugo Zeye for a preparation squadron amid the armada moves in the North Sea. Legitimately after the finish of the armada moves in mid-September, "Schwaben" partook in armada gunnery bores off Helgoland. The year was finished up with an upgrade in the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven. 

In 1908, the preparation ships situated in the Baltic were put under the order of Rear Admiral Hugo von Pohl, who might proceed to direction the High Seas Fleet in 1915 amid World War I. That year pursued a similar example as the earlier year, yet "Schwaben" did not take an interest in the harvest time armada moves. She rather stayed at Sonderburg and Alsen amid the activities. In 1909, after the fall moves, "Schwaben" was doled out as the lead of the Reserve Fleet, again under the direction of Admiral Zeye. Amid her yearly update at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, her firearms were fitted with new engines delivered in Germany to test their dependability over remote fabricated engines. The tests ended up being fruitful. While steaming in the Flensburg Firth on 10â 12 December, she needed to help the preparation send in overwhelming mist. 

In 1910, after the ordinary preparing routine in the principal half of the year, "Schwaben" was allocated to the III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet for the fall moves, which kept going from 19 August to 11 September. She served in this job to supplant the ships and , which had been sold to the Ottoman Empire just before the beginning of the moves. On 14 October, she collaborated with the war vessel and steamed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to Kiel for her yearly update at the Imperial Dockyard there. These fixes kept going until 4 January 1911. "Schwaben" served in the III Battle Squadron amid the harvest time moves again in 1911. By 1911, the eight and es of man of war vessels had entered administration; these boats were appointed to the I Battle Squadron, which uprooted the more current pre-gunboats of the and es to the II and III Battle Squadrons. Thus, "Schwaben" was decommissioned in Wilhelmshaven on 30 December 1911 and alloted to the Reserve Division in the North Sea. She was set back in administration quickly from 9 to 12 May 1912 to move to Kiel. "Schwaben" came back to support again to take part in the harvest time moves from 14 August to 28 September, as the leader of at that point "KAdm" Maximilian von Spee. 

After the episode of World War I in August 1914, "Schwaben" and the remainder of her class were prepared to serve in the IV Battle Squadron, under the direction of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt. After it achieved full battle availability, the Squadron was utilized both as a resistance constrain in the German Bightâtypically positioned in the mouth of the Elbeâand for tasks in the Baltic. Beginning on 3 September, the IV Squadron, helped by the defensively covered cruiser , led a compass into the Baltic. The task kept going until 9 September and neglected to convey Russian maritime units to fight. In May 1915, IV Squadron, including "Schwaben", was exchanged to help the German Army in the Baltic Sea region. "Schwaben" and her sisters were then situated in Kiel. Amid this period, she filled in as the leader of the second direction chief of naval operations of the Squadron, "KAdm" Alberts. 

On 6 May, the IV Squadron ships were entrusted with offering help to the strike on Libau. "Schwaben" and different boats remained off Gotland to block any Russian cruisers that may endeavor to mediate in the arrivals, which the Russians did not endeavor. On 10 May, after the intrusion drive had entered Libau, the British submarines and recognized the IV Squadron, yet were excessively far away to make an assault. The inexorably dynamic British submarines constrained the Germans to utilize more destroyers to secure the capital boats. Thus, "Schwaben" and her sisters were excluded in the German armada that ambushed the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, because of the shortage of escorts. On 29 August, "KapitÃ¤n zur See" (Captain at Sea) Walter Engelhardt supplanted Alberts on board "Schwaben". She was then utilized as a watchman dispatch in Libau, beginning on 24 September. On 10â 11 November, "Schwaben", her sisters and , and "Prinz Heinrich" left Libau, headed for Kiel. 

By late 1915, the expanding danger from British submarines in the Baltic persuaded the German naval force to pull back the older "Wittelsbach"- class ships from dynamic administration. On 20 November "Schwaben" steamed to Wilhelmshaven, where she substituted as a preparation dispatch for designers, a job she held for the rest of the war. After the Battle of Jutland on 31 MayÂ â 1 June, in which "Schwaben" did not participate, Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper, the leader of the German battlecruiser squadron, sent his four enduring battlecruisers to dock for fixes. Cooler made "Schwaben", which was positioned in Wilhelmshaven, his brief order dispatch while his power was being fixed. In 1916, "Schwaben" was incompletely incapacitated; the four 24Â cm firearms were expelled, her battery of 15Â cm weapons was diminished to six weapons, and just four 8.8Â cm firearms were left on board. 

The ship was quickly held by the Reichsmarine after the war, and was reactivated for administration on 1 August 1919. As indicated by Articles 182 and 193 of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was obliged to keep adequate vessels in commission to clear mines from extensive regions in the North and Baltic Seas. "Schwaben" was thusly changed over into a terminal ship for F-type minesweepers to help with meeting Germany's bargain commitments, which involved evacuation of her residual weaponry and development of stages to hold the minesweepers. She was relegated to the sixth Baltic Minesweeping Half-Flotilla, however this administration did not keep going long, as the minesweeping work was finished by 19 June 1920. The old ship was stricken from the maritime register on 8 March 1921. She was sold for 3,090,000Â marks and separated for scrap that year in Kiel-Nordmole.
