Burnett had drawn some analysis, as he performed ineffectively in his last appearance before the World Series, a begin in GameÂ 5 of the ALCS in which he permitted six keeps running more than six innings. Nonetheless, Burnett had recently been effective on brief rest, running 4â 0 with a 2.33 ERA in four profession begins on brief rest before this amusement. Some trusted Girardi settled on a three-man revolution since he had constrained choices for a fourth beginning pitcher, either Gaudin or Joba Chamberlain, who had been conflicting as starters in the normal season and had been moved into the warm up area for the postseason. 

The matchup of closers, Mariano Rivera and Brad Lidge, additionally drew consideration. Rivera and Lidge were the main closers who had not blown a spare amid the 2009 postseason, though closers on other postseason groups blew 11 spares in the 24 postseason diversions before the World Series in 2009. Both had performed well amid the postseason, however Lidge had posted a 7.21 ERA amid the 2009 ordinary season, as opposed to Rivera's 1.76. Lidge's 2009 numbers were as a distinct difference to the past season (41 out of 41 spare chances, a 1.95 ERA, and 92 strikeouts in 62 recreations).
