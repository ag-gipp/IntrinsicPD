Neferirkare Kakai 

Neferirkare Kakai (referred to in Greek as NefercherÃªs, ÎÎµÏÎµÏÏÎ­ÏÎ·Ï) was an antiquated Egyptian pharaoh, the third lord of the Fifth Dynasty. Neferirkare, the oldest child of Sahure with his associate Meretnebty, was known as Ranefer A preceding he went to the honored position. He acquiesced the day after his dad's demise and ruled for eight to eleven years, at some point in the right on time to mid-25th century BCE. He was himself all around likely prevailing by his oldest child, conceived of his ruler Khentkaus II, the sovereign Ranefer B who might accept the position of authority as lord Neferefre. Neferirkare fathered another pharaoh, Nyuserre Ini, who took the royal position after Neferefre's short rule and the concise guideline of the ineffectively known Shepseskare. 

Neferirkare was recognized by his counterparts as a sort and considerate ruler, interceding for his retainers after an incident. His standard saw a development in the quantity of organization and ministry authorities, who utilized their extended riches to fabricate structurally progressively advanced mastabas, where they recorded their accounts out of the blue. Neferirkare was the last pharaoh to essentially adjust the standard imperial titulary, isolating the nomen or original name, from the prenomen or position of royalty name. From his rule onwards, the previous was written in a cartouche gone before by the "Child of Ra" sobriquet. His standard saw proceeding with exchange relations with Nubia toward the south and conceivably with Byblos on the Levantine coast toward the north. 

Neferirkare began a pyramid for himself in the imperial necropolis of Abusir, called "Ba-Neferirkare" signifying "Neferirkare is a Ba". It was at first intended to be a stage pyramid, a structure which had not been utilized since the times of the Third Dynasty around 120 years sooner. This arrangement was adjusted to change the landmark into a genuine pyramid, the biggest in Abusir, which was never finished attributable to the demise of the lord. What's more, Neferirkare constructed a sanctuary to the sun god Ra called "Setibre", that is "Site of the core of Ra". Antiquated sources express that it was the biggest one worked amid the Fifth Dynasty however as of the mid 21st century it has not yet been found. 

After his demise, Neferirkare profited by a funerary clique occurring in his morgue sanctuary, which had been finished by his child Nyuserre Ini. This clique appears to have vanished toward the finish of the Old Kingdom time frame, in spite of the fact that it may have been restored amid the Twelfth Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom, though in an exceptionally restricted structure. More likely than not, it was additionally around this time the tale of the Papyrus Westcar was first composed, a story where Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare are said to be siblings, the children of Ra with a lady Rededjet. 

Neferirkare is all around bore witness to in sources contemporaneous with his rule. Past his pyramid complex, he is referenced in the tomb of a considerable lot of his peers, for example, his vizier Washptah, the subject Rawer and the minister Akhethetep. Neferirkare likewise shows up in the about contemporaneous Giza composing board, a short rundown gathering six rulers from various lines dating to the later Fifth or mid Sixth Dynasty. The composition board was revealed in the tomb of a high official named Mesdjerw, who may have created it for his utilization in existence in the wake of death. 

Neferirkare is bore witness to in two antiquated Egyptian ruler records, both dating to the New Kingdom. The soonest of these is the Abydos King List composed amid the rule of Seti I (fl. 1290â 1279 BCE). There, Neferirkare's nomen "Kakai" involves the 28th section, in the middle of those of Sahure and Neferefre. Amid the consequent rule of Ramses II (fl. 1279â 1213 BCE), Neferirkare's prenomen was recorded on the 27th section of the Saqqara Tablet, yet this time as a successor of Sahure and ancestor of Shepseskare. 

Neferirkare was additionally given a section on the Turin standard, an archive dating to the rule of Ramses II too. Neferirkare's entrance is ordinarily accepted to be on the third section nineteenth column; lamentably this line has been lost in an extensive lacuna influencing the papyrus and neither his rule length nor his successor can be found out from the enduring pieces. The Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has moreover suggested that the Turin standard makes another line begin with this section and in this manner that Neferirkare would be its author. The division of the Turin standard rundown of rulers into traditions is an as of now discussed. The Egyptologist JaromÃ­r MÃ¡lek for instance observes the divisions between gatherings of rulers happening in the group as checking exchanges of illustrious home instead of the ascent and fall of regal administrations as this term is as of now comprehended, a use which just started in the Egyptian setting with the third century BCE work of the minister Manetho. Additionally, the Egyptologist Stephan Seidlmeyer, considers the break in the Turin Canon toward the finish of the Eighth Dynasty to speak to the movement of the imperial living arrangement from Memphis to Herakleopolis. The Egyptologist John Baines holds sees that are nearer to Verner's, trusting that the group was separated into administrations with sums for the time slipped by given toward the finish of each, however just couple of such divisions have endure. Correspondingly, Professor John Van Seters sees the breaks in the group as divisions between traditions, however interestingly, states that the foundation for these divisions stays obscure. He theorizes that the example of lines may have been taken from the nine celestial lords of the Greater and Lesser Enneads. The Egyptologist Ian Shaw trusts that the Turin Canon gives some believability to Manetho's division of traditions, yet considers the ruler records to be a type of precursor venerate and not an authentic record. 

This entire dangerous could be mooted in another of Verner's theories, where he recommended that Neferirkare's entrance may have been situated on the twentieth line as opposed to the nineteenth as is typically accepted. This would acknowledge Neferirkare for a long time of rule, and would make Sahure the line originator in the theory that the standard records such occasions. Archeological confirmations have set up that the changes from Userkaf to Sahure and from Sahure to Neferirkare were fatherâ child advances, with the goal that neither Sahure nor Neferirkare can be line organizers in the cutting edge feeling of the term. 

Neferirkare was referenced in the "Aegyptiaca", a background marked by Egypt written in the third century BCE amid the rule of Ptolemy II (283â 246 BCE) by Manetho. No duplicates of the Aegyptiaca have made due right up 'til the present time and it is currently known just through later works by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. The Byzantine researcher George Syncellus reports that Africanus relates that the "Aegyptiaca" referenced the progression "SephrÃªs â NefercherÃªs â SisirÃªs" for the early Fifth Dynasty. SephrÃªs, NefercherÃªs and SisirÃªs are accepted to be the hellenized shapes for Sahure, Neferirkare and Shepseskare, separately. Along these lines, Manetho's remaking of the Fifth Dynasty is in concurrence with the Saqqara tablet. In Africanus' embodiment of the "Aegyptiaca", NefercherÃªs is accounted for to have ruled for a long time. 

Until 2005, the character of Neferirkare's folks was dubious. A few Egyptologists, including Nicolas Grimal, William C. Hayes, Hartwig AltenmÃ¼ller, Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton, saw him as a child of Userkaf and Khentkaus I, and a sibling to his antecedent Sahure. The fundamental force behind this hypothesis was the Papyrus Westcar, an Ancient Egyptian story portraying the ascent of the Fifth Dynasty. In it, a conjurer forecasts Khufu the future destruction of his heredity as three siblings, the initial three rulers of the Fifth Dynasty, will be conceived of the god Ra and a lady named Rededjet. Egyptologists, for example, Verner have looked to recognize a chronicled truth in this record, suggesting that Sahure and Neferirkare were kin conceived of ruler Khentkaus I. 

In 2005, unearthings of the interstate paving the way to Sahure's pyramid yielded new alleviation parts which demonstrated undeniably that pharaoh Sahure and his partner, ruler Meretnebty, were Neferirkare's folks. In reality, these reliefsâfound by Verner and Tarek El Awadyâdelineate Sahure and Meretnebty together with their two children Ranefer and Netjerirenre. While the two children are given the title of "ruler's oldest child", perhaps demonstrating that they were twins, Ranefer is appeared at Sahure and furthermore given the title of "boss lector-cleric", which may mirror that he was brought into the world first and in this manner given higher positions. Since Ranefer is known to have been the name of Neferirkare before he took the honored position, as demonstrated by reliefs from the funeral home sanctuary of Sahure (see underneath), presumably subsists as to Neferirkare's filiation. Nothing more is known on Netjerirenre, a perception which drove Verner and El-Awady to guess that he could have endeavored to catch the position of royalty at the surprising demise of Neferirkare's child and successor Neferefre, who passed on in his mid twenties following two years on the royal position. In this assumed theory, he would be the vaporous Shepseskare. At long last, a similar help just as another record a further four children of Sahure, Khakare, Horemsaf, Raemsaf and Nebankhre however the personality of their mom is obscure, with the goal that they are in this way in any event relatives to Neferirkare. 

As of the mid 21st century, the main known ruler of Neferirkare is Khentkaus II. This is because of the situation of her pyramid beside that of Neferirkare as was typical for the partner of a ruler, just as her title of "lord's better half" and a few reliefs speaking to them two together. Neferirkare could have had something like one other life partner, as recommended by the nearness of a little pyramid by that of Khentkaus, yet this remaining parts theoretical. 

Neferirkare and his partner Khentkaus II were, no doubt, the guardians of sovereign Ranefer B, the future pharaoh Neferefre. 

This relationship is affirmed by a help on a limestone section found in a house in the town close Abusir portraying Neferirkare and his significant other Khentkaus with "the ruler's oldest child Ranefer", a name indistinguishable with certain variations of Neferefre's own. This demonstrates, similarly with respect to Neferirkare, Ranefer was Neferefre's name when he was still just a crown ruler, that is, before his promotion to the position of authority. 

Neferirkare and Khentkaus II had somewhere around one other youngster together, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. Undoubtedly, Neferirkare's partner Khentkaus II is known to have been Nyuserre's mom, since unearthings of her funeral home sanctuary yielded a fragmentary help demonstrating her confronting Nyuserre and his family. Astoundingly, on this help both Khentkaus and Nyuserre show up on a similar scale, a perception which might be associated with Khentkaus' upgraded status amid Nyuserre's rule, as he tried to legitimize his standard after the sudden passing of Neferefre and the conceivable test by Shepseskare. Additional proof for the filiation of Nyuserre are the area of his pyramid beside that of Neferirkare, just as his reuse for his very own valley sanctuary of materials from Neferikare's incomplete developments. 

One more child of Neferirkare and Khentkhaus has been proposed, presumably more youthful than both Neferefre and Nyuserre: Iryenre, a sovereign "iry-pat" whose relationship is recommended by the way that his funerary faction was related with that of his mom, both having occurred in the sanctuary of Khentkaus II. 

At last, Neferirkare and Khentkaus II may likewise be the guardians of ruler Khentkaus III, whose tomb was found in Abusir in 2015. For sure, in light of the area and general date for her tomb, just as her titles of "ruler's better half" and "lord's mom", Khentkaus III was more likely than not Neferefre's associate and the mother of either Menkauhor Kaiu or Shepseskare. 

Manetho's "Aegyptiaca" doles out Neferirkare a rule of 20 years, yet the archeological proof currently proposes this is an overestimate. To start with, the harmed Palermo Stone jam "the time of the fifth steers tally" for Neferirkare's time on the position of authority. The cows check was an essential occasion gone for assessing the measure of expenses to be collected on the populace. By the rule of Neferirkare, this included tallying cows, bulls and little domesticated animals. This occasion is accepted to have been biennial amid the Old Kingdom time frame, that is happening once at regular intervals, implying that Neferirkare ruled no less than ten years. Given the state of the Palermo stone, this record must relate to his last year or be near it, with the goal that he governed close to eleven years. This is additionally substantiated by two cursive engravings left by bricklayers on stone squares from the pyramids of Khentkaus II and Neferirkare, the two of which likewise date to Neferirkare's fifth dairy cattle check, its most noteworthy known regnal year. At last, Verner has called attention to that a 20-year-long rule would be hard to accommodate with the incomplete condition of his pyramid in Abusir. 

Past his development of a pyramid and sun sanctuary, little is known about Neferirkare's exercises amid his time on the royal position. A few occasions dating to his first and only long periods of rule are recorded on the enduring parts of the Palermo stone, a regal chronicle covering the period from the beginning of the rule of Menes of the First Dynasty until around the season of Neferirkare's standard. As per the Palermo stone, the future pharaoh Neferirkare, at that point called ruler Ranefer, climbed the position of authority the day after his dad Sahure's passing, which happened on the 28th day of the ninth month. 

The chronicle at that point records that in his first year as ruler, Neferirkare conceded land to the rural homes serving the factions of the Ennead, the Souls of Pe and Nekhen and the divine forces of Keraha. To Ra and Hathor, he devoted an offering table furnished with 210 day by day contributions, and requested the development of two store rooms and the work of new wards in the host sanctuary. 

Neferirkare likewise told "the molding and opening of the mouth of an electrum statue of [the god] Ihy, escorting [it] to the "mrt"- house of prayer of Snefru of the "nht"- hallowed place of Hathor". Later in his rule, in the time of the fifth cows check, Neferirkare had a bronze statue of himself raised and set up four barques for Ra and Horus in and around his sun sanctuary, two of which were of copper. The Souls of Pe and Nekhen and Wadjet got electrum blessings, while Ptah was given terrains. 

The way that the Palermo stone ends around Neferirkare's standard drove a few researchers, for example, Grimal, to recommend that they may have been incorporated amid his rule. 

Barely any particular authoritative moves made by Neferirkare are known. One announcement of his recorded on a limestone section was unearthed in 1903 in Abydos and is presently in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. The pronouncement exempts staff having a place with a sanctuary of Khenti-Amentiu from undertaking obligatory work in interminability, under punishment of relinquishment of all property and opportunity and be compelled to till the ground or in a stone quarry. This announcement in a roundabout way recommends that tax assessment and necessary work was forced on everyone when in doubt. 

All the more for the most part, Neferirkare's rule saw the development of the Egyptian organization and brotherhood, which amassed more power than in prior rules, despite the fact that the ruler remained a living god. Specifically the places of viziers and administrator of the campaign, that is the most elevated workplaces, were opened to individuals from outside the illustrious family. 

Related to this pattern, the mastabas of high authorities began to turn out to be increasingly intricate, with, for instance, houses of prayer including different rooms, and from the mid to late Fifth Dynasty, wide passageway porticoes with segments and family tomb buildings. It is additionally as of now that these authorities began to record personal histories on the dividers of their tombs. 

The rule of Neferirkare Kakai saw the last essential change to the titulary of pharaohs. He was the soonest pharaoh to isolate the "nswt-bjtj" ("King of Upper and Lower Egypt") and "S3-RË" ("Son of Ra") appellations of the imperial titulary. He connected these two sobriquets with two extraordinary, autonomous names: the prenomen and nomen, individually. The prenomen or position of authority name, taken by the new lord as he rose the honored position, was written in a cartouche following the honey bee and sedge signs for "nswt-bjtj". From Neferirkare's time onwards, the nomen, or original name, was additionally written in cartouche methodicallly gone before by the notice of "Child of Ra", a sobriquet which had seen little use in going before times. 

There is little proof for military activity amid Neferirkare's rule. William C. Hayes suggested that a couple of fragmentary limestone statues of bowing and bound detainees of war found in his funeral home sanctuary conceivably bear witness to correctional strikes in Libya toward the west or the Sinai and Canaan toward the east amid his rule. The workmanship history specialist William Stevenson Smith remarked that such statues were standard components of the enhancement of regal sanctuaries and mastabas, proposing that they may not be quickly identified with real military battles. Comparative statues and little wooden figures of bowing hostages were found in the morgue buildings of Neferefre, Djedkare Isesi, Unas, Teti, Pepi I and Pepi II just as in the tomb of vizier Senedjemib Mehi. 

Exchange relations with Nubia are the main ones bore witness to amid Neferirkare's rule. The archeological proof for this are seal impressions and ostracon bearing his name revealed in the stronghold of Buhen, on the second waterfall of the Nile. Contacts with Byblos on the Levantine coast may likewise have occurred amid Neferirkare's standard, as proposed by a solitary alabaster bowl engraved with his name uncovered there. 

Neferirkare's rule was surprising for the critical number of enduring contemporary records which portray him as a sort and delicate ruler. Whenever Rawer, an old aristocrat and illustrious squire, was inadvertently contacted by the ruler's mace amid a religious serviceâa perilous circumstance which could have made this authority be killed promptly or exiled from court since the pharaoh was seen as a living god in Old Kingdom folkloreâNeferirkare immediately absolved Rawer and told that no damage ought to jump out at the last for the occurrence. As Rawer appreciatively states in an engraving from his Giza tomb: 

Also, Neferirkare gave the Priest of Ptah Ptahshepses the uncommon respect of kissing his feet as opposed to the ground before him. At long last, when the vizier Washptah endured a stroke while going to court, the ruler immediately called the royal residence's central specialists to treat his withering vizier. At the point when Weshptah kicked the bucket, Neferirkare was purportedly forlorn and resigned to his own quarters to grieve the loss of his companion. The ruler at that point requested the cleaning of Weshptah's body in his essence and requested a coal black casket made for the perished vizier. Weshptah was covered with extraordinary enrichments and ceremonies obligingness of Neferirkare. The records of the ruler's activities are engraved in Weshptah's tomb itself and stress Neferirkare's humankind towards his subjects. 

The Pyramid of Neferirkare Kakai, referred to the Ancient Egyptians as "Ba-Neferirkare" and differently interpreted as "Neferirkare is a Ba" or "Neferirkare takes structure", is situated in the illustrious necropolis of Abusir. It is the biggest one worked amid the Fifth Dynasty, equalling generally the span of the Pyramid of Menkaure. 

The pyramid development involved three phases: first constructed were six stages of rubble, their holding dividers made of privately quarried limestone demonstrating that the landmark was initially wanted to be a stage pyramid, a strange plan for the time which had not been utilized since the Third Dynasty, somewhere in the range of 120 years sooner. Now the pyramid, had it been finished, would have come to . This arrangement was then adjusted by a second development organize with the expansion of filling between the means intended to change the landmark into a genuine pyramid. At a later stage, the laborers developed the pyramid further, including a support of brick work and smooth packaging stones of red rock. This work was never completed, even after the works executed by Nyuserre. 

With a square base of sides, the pyramid would have achieved high had it been finished. Today it is in remnants inferable from broad stone burglarizing. The passage to the pyramid's substructures was situated on its north side. There, a dropping passageway with a peak rooftop made of limestone shafts drove into an entombment chamber. No bits of the stone casket of the ruler were found there. 

The pyramid of Neferirkare is encompassed by littler pyramids and tombs which appear to shape a building unit, the graveyard of his nearby family. This outfit was intended to be come to from the Nile through an interstate and a valley sanctuary close to the waterway. At the demise of Neferirkare, just the establishments of both had been laid and Nyuserre later redirected the incomplete thoroughfare to his own pyramid. 

The funeral home sanctuary was a long way from completed at the passing of Neferirkare yet it was finished later, by his children Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini utilizing shoddy mudbricks and wood as opposed to stone. A huge store of regulatory papyri, known as the Abusir papyri, was revealed there by illicit diggers in 1893 and therefore by Borchardt in 1903. Further papyri were additionally revealed in the mid-seventies amid a University of Prague Egyptological Institute removal. The nearness of this store is because of the impossible to miss verifiable conditions of the mid-Fifth Dynasty. 

As both Neferirkare and his beneficiary Neferefre kicked the bucket before their pyramid edifices could be done, Nyuserre changed their arranged format, occupying the interstate prompting Neferirkare's pyramid to his own. This implied Neferefre's and Neferirkare's morgue buildings turned out to be to some degree disengaged on the Abusir level, their ministers hence needed to live beside the sanctuary premises in temporary residences, and they put away the regulatory records nearby. Interestingly, the records of different sanctuaries were kept in the pyramid town near Sahure's or Nyuserre's pyramid, where the ebb and flow dimension of ground water implies any papyrus has since a long time ago vanished. 

The Abusir papyri record a few subtleties relating to Neferirkare's morgue sanctuary. Its focal sanctuary housed a specialty with five statues of the lord. The focal one is portrayed in the papyri just like a portrayal of the lord as Osiris, while the first and last ones delineated him as the ruler of Upper and Lower Egypt, individually. The sanctuary likewise involved store-spaces for the contributions, where various stone vesselsâpresently brokenâhad been saved. At long last the papyri show that of the four water crafts incorporated into the funeral home intricate, two were covered toward the north and south of the pyramid, one of which was uncovered by Verner. 

Amid the Late Period of antiquated Egypt (664â 332 BCE) the morgue sanctuary of Neferirkare was utilized as an auxiliary burial ground. A headstone made of yellow calcite was found by Borchardt bearing an Aramaic engraving perusing "Having a place with Nesneu, child of Tapakhnum". Another engraving in Aramaic found on a limestone square and dating to the fifth century BCE peruses "Mannukinaan child of Sewa". 

Neferirkare is known from old sources to have assembled a sanctuary to the sun god Ra, which is yet to be recognized archeologically. It was designated "Setibre", signifying "Site of the core of Ra", and was, as per contemporary sources, the biggest one worked amid the Fifth Dynasty. It is conceivable that the sanctuary was just worked out of mudbricks, with an arranged fulfillment in stone which had not begun when Neferirkare kicked the bucket. For this situation, it would quickly have transformed into remains that would be extremely hard to situate for archeologists. Then again, the Egyptologist Rainer Stadelmann has recommended that the "Setibre" just as the sun sanctuaries of Sahure and Userkaf were one and the equivalent known structure, that credited to Userkaf in Abusir. 

Of all the sun sanctuaries worked amid the Fifth Dynasty, the "Setibre" is the one most ordinarily refered to in antiquated sources. Because of this, a few subtleties of its format are known: it had an extensive focal pillar, a special stepped area and store-rooms, a fixed barque room lodging two vessels and a "corridor of the 'Sed celebration. Religious celebrations did unquestionably occur in sun sanctuaries, as is bore witness to by the Abusir papyri. On account of the "Setibre", the celebration of the "Night of Ra" is explicitly said to have occurred there. This was a celebration worried about Ra's voyage amid the night and associated with the thoughts of restoration and resurrection that were integral to sun sanctuaries. 

The sanctuary assumed an imperative job in the dispersion of sustenance contributions which were conveyed ordinarily from that point to the funeral home sanctuary of the ruler. This voyage was made by pontoon, showing that the "Setibre" was not nearby Neferirkare's pyramid. This additionally underscores the needy position of the ruler as for Ra, as contributions were made to the sun god and after that to the expired lord. 

The Egyptologist Werner Kaiser proposed, in light of an investigation of the development of the symbolic representation determinative for "sun sanctuary", that Neferirkare finished the sun sanctuary of Userkafâreferred to in Ancient Egyptian as "Nekhenre"â at some point around the fifth steers check of his rule. This conclusion is shared by the Egyptologists and archeologists Ogden Goelet, Mark Lehner and Herbert Ricke. In this theory, Neferirkare would have given the "Nekhenre" with its fantastic monolith of limestone and red rock. 

Verner and the Egyptologist Paule Posener-KriÃ©ger have called attention to two troubles with the speculation. Right off the bat, it would suggest a long intermission between the two periods of development of Userkaf's sanctuary: about 25 years between the erection of the sanctuary and that of its monolith. Furthermore, they see that both the pyramid and sun sanctuary of Neferirkare were incomplete at his passing, bringing up the issue concerning why the lord would have given extraordinary exertion on a landmark of Userkaf when his own still required significant attempts to be finished. Rather, Verner recommends that it was Sahure who completed the "Nekhenre". 

Similarly as with different pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty, Neferirkare was the object of a funerary clique after his passing. Barrel seals having a place with clerics and priestesses serving in this religion bear witness to his reality amid the Old Kingdom time frame. 

For instance, a dark steatite seal, presently in the Metropolitan Museum bears the engraving "Votary of Hathor and priestess of the great god Neferirkare, cherished of the divine beings". A portion of these authorities had jobs in the factions of a few lords, just as in their sun sanctuaries. 

Contributions for the funerary clique of expired rulers were given by devoted farming domains set up amid the lord's rule. A couple of these are known for Neferirkare, including "The bequest of Kakai (named) the "i3gt" of Kakai", "Solid is the intensity of Kakai", "The ranches of Kakai", "Nekhbet wants that Kakai lives", "Neferirkare is adored of the ennead" and "The house of the Ba of Neferirkare". 

Hints of the proceeded with presence of the funerary clique of Neferirkare past the Old Kingdom time frame are meager. A couple of statues having a place with a certain Sekhemhotep were revealed in Giza, one of which is recorded with the standard Ancient Egyptian offering recipe pursued by "of the sanctuary of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Neferirkare, valid for voice". The statues, which date to the mid twelfth Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom time frame are the main archeological confirmations that Neferirkare's funerary religion still existed or had been resuscitated around Abusir at the time, though in a constrained structure.
