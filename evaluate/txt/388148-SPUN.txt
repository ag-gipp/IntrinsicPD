Marie Lloyd 

Matilda Alice Victoria Wood (12 February 1870Â â 7 October 1922), expertly known as Marie Lloyd ; was an English music lobby vocalist, entertainer and melodic theater performing artist. She was best known for her exhibitions of tunes, for example, "The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery", "My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)" and "Gracious Mr Porter What Shall I Do". She got both analysis and commendation for her utilization of insinuation and two sided saying amid her exhibitions, yet delighted in a long and prosperous vocation, amid which she was tenderly called the "Ruler of the Music Hall". 

Conceived in London, she was displayed by her dad at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton. In 1884, she made her expert dÃ©but as Bella Delmere; she changed her stage name to Marie Lloyd the next year. In 1885, she had accomplishment with her melody "The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery", and she every now and again bested the bill at esteemed performance centers in London's West End. In 1891, she was enrolled by the manager Augustus Harris to show up in that year's fabulous Theater Royal, Drury Lane Christmas emulate "Humpty Dumpty". She featured in a further two creations at the theater, "Little Bo Peep" (1892) and "Robinson Crusoe" (1893). By the mid-1890s, Lloyd was in successive debate with Britain's performance center blue pencils due to the suggestive substance of her melodies. 

Somewhere in the range of 1894 and 1900, she turned into a universal achievement when she visited France, America, Australia and Belgium with her performance music corridor act. In 1907, she helped different entertainers amid the music lobby war and partook in shows outside theaters, challenging for better pay and conditions for entertainers. Amid the First World War, just the same as most other music lobby craftsmen, she upheld enlistment into the outfitted administrations to help the war exertion, visiting emergency clinics and modern organizations to help support confidence. In 1915, she played out her solitary wartime melody "Now You've Got Your Khaki On", which turned into a most loved among cutting edge troops. 

Lloyd had a tempestuous private life that was regularly the subject of press consideration: she was hitched multiple times, separated from twice, and much of the time ended up giving court declaration against two of her spouses who had physically mishandled her. In later life, she was still sought after at music corridors and had a late accomplishment in 1919 with her execution of "My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)", which wound up a standout amongst her most prominent tunes. Secretly, she experienced episodes of sick wellbeing and progressed toward becoming liquor needy, the two of which forced limitations on her performing vocation by the 1920s. In 1922, she gave her last execution at the Alhambra Theater, London, amid which she turned out to be sick in front of an audience. She passed on a couple of days after the fact at 52 years old. 

Lloyd was conceived on 12 February 1870 in Hoxton, London. Her dad, John Wood (1847â 1940), was a fake bloom arranger and server; her mom, Matilda Mary Caroline "nÃ©e" Archer (1849â 1931), was a dressmaker and outfit fashioner. Lloyd was the oldest of nine kids and ended up referred to inside the family hover as Tilley. The Wood family were decent, persevering, and monetarily agreeable. Lloyd frequently took profession exhortation from her mom, whose impact was solid in the family. Lloyd went to a school in Bath Street, London, yet despised formal instruction and frequently played truant; with both her folks working, she embraced a maternal job over her kin, keeping them engaged, spotless and very much thought about. Alongside her sister Alice, she organized occasions in which the Wood youngsters performed at the family home. Lloyd delighted in engaging her family and chose to shape a minstrel demonstration in 1879 called the Fairy Bell troupe, including her kin. 

Lloyd and the troupe made their dÃ©but at a mission in Nile Street, Hoxton, in 1880 and pursued this with an appearance at the Blue Ribbon Gospel Temperance Mission later that year. Costumed by Matilda, they visited neighborhood doss-houses in East London, where they performed balance melodies, showing individuals the threats of liquor misuse. Anxious to flaunt his little girl's ability, John verified her unpaid work as a table vocalist at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton, where he filled in as a server. Among the melodies she performed there was "My Soldier Laddie". Together with her exhibitions at the Eagle, Lloyd quickly added to the family pay by making children's boots, and, later, twisted quills for cap making. She was fruitless at both and was sacked from the last subsequent to being found moving on the tables by the foreman. She returned home that night and announced that she needed a perpetual profession on the stage. Albeit cheerful to make them perform in her extra time, her folks at first restricted the possibility of her showing up on the stage full-time. She reviewed that when her folks "saw that they couldn't kick their protests as high as [she] could kick [her] legs, they all around reasonably reached the resolution to give things a chance to take their course and said 'Favor you my kid, do what you like'." 

On 9 May 1885, at 15 years old, Lloyd made her expert solo stage dÃ©but at the Grecian music corridor (in indistinguishable premises from the Eagle Tavern), under the name "Matilda Wood". She performed "In the Good Old Days" and "My Soldier Laddie", which demonstrated fruitful, and earned her a booking at the Sir John Falstaff music lobby in Old Street where she sang a progression of sentimental numbers. Not long after this, she picked the stage name Bella Delmere and showed up in front of an audience in ensembles structured by her mom. Her exhibitions were a triumph, in spite of her singing other craftsmen's tunes without their consent, a training which brought her a risk of a directive from one of the first entertainers. Updates on her demonstration voyaged; that October, she showed up at the Collins music corridor in Islington in an uncommon exhibition to praise the theater's renovation, the first occasion when she had showed up outside Hoxton, and after two months, she was locked in at the Hammersmith Temple of Varieties and the Middlesex Music Hall in Drury Lane. On 3 February 1886, she showed up at the lofty Sebright Music Hall in Bethnal Green, where she met George Ware, a productive writer of music corridor melodies. Product turned into her operator and, following half a month, she started performing tunes obtained from little-known arrangers. As her notoriety developed, Ware proposed that she change her name. "Marie" was picked for its "rich" and "marginally French" sound, and "Lloyd" was taken from a release of "Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper". 

Lloyd built up her new name on 22 June 1886, with an appearance at the Falstaff Music Hall, where she pulled in wide notice for the tune "The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery" (which was at first composed for Nelly Power by Lloyd's operator George Ware). By 1887, her execution of the tune had turned out to be popular to the point that she was sought after in London's West End, including the Oxford Music Hall, where she exceeded expectations at skirt moving. George Belmont, the Falstaff's owner, verified her a commitment at the Star Palace of Varieties in Bermondsey. She before long started making her very own outfits, an expertise she gained from her mom, and one she utilized for the remainder of her vocation. She attempted a month-long voyage through Ireland toward the beginning of 1886, acquiring Â£10 every week after which she came back to East London to perform at, among others, the Sebright Music Hall, Bethnal Green. On 23 October, "The Era" called her "an entirely little soubrette who hits the dance floor with incredible dash and vitality." 

Before the finish of 1886, Lloyd was playing a few lobbies per night and earned Â£100 every week. She was currently ready to bear the cost of new tunes from set up music lobby arrangers and journalists, including "Harry's a Soldier", "She Has a Sailor for a Lover", and "Goodness Jeremiah, Don't you Go to Sea". By 1887, Lloyd started to show an expertise for off the cuff, and to pick up a notoriety for her off the cuff exhibitions. It was amid this period that she initially sang "Whacky-Wack" and "When you Wink the Other Eye", a melody which presented her renowned wink at the crowd. Not at all like her West End groups of onlookers who making the most of her coarse humor, her "blue" exhibitions did not awe gatherings of people in the East End. 

While showing up at the Foresters music corridor in Mile End, she met and started dating Percy Charles Courtenay, a ticket tout from Streatham, London. The romance was brief, and the couple wedded on 12 November 1887 at St John the Baptist, Hoxton. In May 1888, Lloyd brought forth a little girl, Marie (1888â 1967). The marriage was for the most part miserable, and Courtenay was detested by Lloyd's family and companions. After a short time, Courtenay wound up dependent on liquor and betting, and became desirous of his significant other's dear fellowship with the 13-year-old on-screen character Bella Burge, to whom Lloyd had leased a room in the conjugal house. He additionally ended up irate at the various gatherings Lloyd facilitated for individual individuals from the music lobby calling including Gus Elen, Dan Leno and Eugene Stratton. 

In October 1888, Lloyd came back from maternity leave and joined practices for the 1888â 89 emulate "The Magic Dragon of the Demon Dell; or, The Search for the Mystic Thyme", in which she was given a role as Princess Kristina. The generation, which was arranged between Boxing Day and February at the Britannia theater in Hoxton, gave her the security of working near and dear for a two-month time span. The commitment additionally gave her truly necessary experience of playing to a major group of onlookers. The next year, she showed up at increasingly Bohemian settings including the Empire and the Alhambra theaters, the Trocadero Palace of Varieties, and the Royal Standard playhouse. In 1889, she brought forth a stillborn kid, which further harmed her marriage. 

By the beginning of the 1890s, Lloyd had developed a fruitful list of melodies, which notwithstanding "What's That For, Eh?", about a young lady who solicits her folks the significance from different ordinary family unit objects. Her biographer and theater student of history W. J. MacQueen-Pope portrayed the melody as being "blue" and believed that it said a lot about her notoriety on account of her "superb wink, and that unexpected, amazing grin, and the gesture of the head." Similar-styled tunes pursued; "She'd Never had her Ticket Punched Before", recounted to the narrative of a youthful, gullible lady making a trip to London all alone via train. This was trailed by "The Wrong Man Never Let a Chance pass By"; "We Don't Want to Fight, But, by Jingo, If we Do"; "Gracious You Wink the Other Eye" and "Twiggy Vous"â a tune which won her much achievement and expanded her notoriety abroad. After a night's exhibition at the Oxford music lobby, a French well-wisher mentioned a discussion and to meet Lloyd behind the stage. Flanked by Courtenay, she showed up at the stage entryway, where Courtenay undermined the man with savagery as both had turned out to be suspicious of his enthusiasm for her. She took a risk and welcomed the man into her changing area, where he distinguished himself as an individual from the French government. He affirmed to her that "Twiggy Vous" was "most prevalent in Paris"; she was charmed at the news. Toward the year's end, Lloyd came back to London where she showed up in the Christmas emulate "Cinderella" in Peckham nearby her sister Alice. 

Somewhere in the range of 1891 and 1893, Lloyd was selected by the manager Augustus Harris to show up close by Dan Leno in the tremendous and prominent Theater Royal, Drury Lane Christmas emulates. While eating with Harris in 1891 to talk about his offer, Lloyd played bashful, intentionally befuddling the performance center with the lesser referred to setting the Old Mo so as not to seem aware of Drury Lane's effective notoriety; she contrasted its structure with that of a jail. Covertly, she was excited with the offer, for which she would get Â£100 every week. The emulate seasons kept going from Boxing Day to March and were exceedingly worthwhile, yet Lloyd discovered working from a content prohibitive. Her first job was Princess Allfair in "Humpty Dumpty; or, The Yellow Dwarf and the Fair One", which she rejected as being "Grisly dreadful, eh?" She got blended audits for her opening execution. "The Times" depicted her as being "fun loving in signal, agile in appearance, yet not solid in voice." Despite the frail begin (which Lloyd accused on nerves), the emulate got gleaming surveys from the dramatic press. The "London Entr'acte" imagined that she "delivere[d] her content sharply, and sings and hits the dance floor with soul as well." She was noted for her gymnastic moving in front of an audience, and had the capacity to show handstands, tumbles and high kicks. As a kid, the essayist Compton Mackenzie was taken to the show's premiere night and conceded that he was "incredibly astounded that any young lady ought to have the fearlessness to let the world see her drawers as unquestionably as Marie Lloyd." 

Lloyd's biographer Midge Gillies characterizes 1891 just like the year that she authoritatively "made it" on account of an index of hit melodies and real achievement in the corridors and emulate. When she showed up at the Oxford music lobby in June, the gathering of people cheered so noisily for her arrival that the accompanying demonstration couldn't be heard; "The Era" called her "the most loved of great importance". Amid the late spring months, she visited North England, including Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester. At the last she remained an additional six evenings because of famous interest, which made her drop an excursion to Paris. The 1892 emulate was "Little Bo Peep; or, Little Red Riding Hood and Hop O' My Thumb", in which she played Little Red Riding Hood. The creation was five hours in length and finished with the show's harlequinade. Amid one scene, her improvisational aptitudes caused some outrage when she got up to implore, however rather went after a chamber pot. The trick irritated Harris, who requested her not to do it again or hazard quick rejection. Max Beerbohm, who was in a later gathering of people, said "Isn't Marie Lloyd enchanting and sweet in the emulate? I consider little other than her." On 12 January 1892, Lloyd and Courtenay fought unsteadily in her Drury Lane changing area after a night's act of "Little Bo-Peep". Courtenay pulled an embellishing sword off the divider and took steps to cut her throat; she got away from the stay with minor wounds and revealed the episode to the Bow Street police headquarters. In mid 1893, she made a trip to Wolverhampton where she featured as Flossie in another ineffective piece called "The A.B.C Girl; or, Flossie the Frivolous", which, as per MacQueen-Pope, "finished the Queen of Comedy's profession as a performing artist". 

Lloyd made her American stage dÃ©but in 1893, showing up at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in New York. She sang "Gracious You Wink the Other Eye", a lot to the joy of her American groups of onlookers. Different numbers were "After the Pantomime" and "You Should Go to France and See the Ladies Dance", which both expected her to wear provocative ensembles. Her exhibitions satisfied the theater owners, who gave her an old fashioned tea and espresso administration. Updates on her prosperity achieved home, and the "London Entr'acte" announced that "Miss Marie Lloyd made the greatest hit at any point known at Koster and Bial's assortment lobby, New York." 

Upon her arrival to London, Lloyd presented "Tune in With the Right Ear", which was a planned follow-up to "Gracious You Wink the Other Eye". Not long after her arrival, she cruised to France, to take up a commitment in Paris. Her biographer Daniel Farson suspected that she got "more prominent praise than whatever other English comedienne who had gone before her". She changed the verses to a portion of her best-known melodies for her French group of onlookers and retitled them, "The Naughty Continong"; "Twiggy Vous"; "I'm Just Back from Paris" and "The Coster Honeymoon in Paris". At Christmas in 1893, she came back to London to respect her last Drury Lane duty, featuring as Polly Perkins in "Robinson Crusoe". The part enabled her to play out "The Barmaid" and "The Naughty Continong" and saw her play out a mazurka with Leno. Conversing with a companion years after the fact about her Drury Lane commitment, she conceded that she was "the proudest little lady on the planet". 

In May 1894, Courtenay pursued Lloyd to the Empire, Leicester Square, where she was performing, and endeavored to hitter her with a stick, yelling: "I will gouge your eyes out and ruin you!" His ambush missed Lloyd, however struck Burge in the face. Because of the occurrence, Lloyd was sacked from the Empire inspired by a paranoid fear of a backlash. Lloyd left the conjugal home, moving to 73 Carleton Road, Tufnell Park and effectively connected for a controlling warrant, which kept Courtenay from reaching her. Half a month later, Lloyd started an issue with the music corridor vocalist Alec Hurley, which brought about Courtenay starting separation procedures in 1894 on the grounds of her infidelity. That year, together with a short voyage through the English territories, Lloyd ventured out to New York with Hurley, where she showed up at the Imperial Theater, remaining for two months. On her arrival to England, she showed up in the Liverpool Christmas emulate as the essential kid in "Lovely Bo-Peep, Little Boy Blue, and the Merry Old Woman who lived in a Shoe". Her execution was commended by the press, who called her "wonderfully simple, effortless and placid." 

By 1895, Lloyd's scandalous melodies were getting continuous analysis from theater analysts and compelling women's activists. Accordingly, she frequently experienced opposition from severe theater control which hounded the remainder of her profession. The essayist and women's activist Laura Ormiston Chant, who was an individual from the Social Purity Alliance, loathed the ribaldry of music lobby exhibitions, and imagined that the settings were appealing to whores. Her crusade convinced the London County Council to erect expansive screens around the promenade at the Empire Theater in Leicester Square, as a major aspect of the authorizing conditions. The screens were disliked and dissenters, among them the youthful Winston Churchill, later pulled them down. That November at the Tivoli theater, Lloyd performed "Johnny Jones", a tune about a young lady who is shown the unavoidable issues facing everyone by her best male companion. The melody, in spite of the fact that not expressively vulgar, was viewed as hostile to a great extent in view of the way in which Lloyd sang it, including winks and signals, and making a conspiratorial association with her gathering of people. Social reformers refered to "Johnny Jones" as being hostile, however less so contrasted with different melodies of the day. Upon the expiry of a music lobby's excitements permit, the Licensing Committee endeavored to utilize the expressive substance of music corridor tunes as proof against a recharging. Therefore, Lloyd was called to play out a portion of her melodies before a gathering board. She sang "Gracious! Mr Porter" (created for her by George Le Brunn), "A Little of What You Fancy" and "She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas", which she retitled "I Sits Amongst the Cabbages and Leeks" after some dissent. The numbers were sung so that the board of trustees had no motivation to discover anything awry. Feeling disappointed at the chamber's impedance, she at that point rendered Alfred Tennyson's illustration room anthem "Come into the Garden, Maud" and showed scoffs and pushes, to outline every allusion. The board were left dazed at the execution, yet Lloyd contended a while later that the impoliteness was "all in the psyche". 

Notwithstanding their contradicting sees on music lobby diversion, Lloyd and Chant had comparable political perspectives, and were wrongly accepted by the press to be foes. A monitor who gave an account of one of Lloyd's exhibitions at the Oxford music lobby believed that her melodious substance was fine yet her knowing gestures, looks, grins and the suggestiveness in her winks to the gathering of people recommended something else. The confinements forced on the music corridors were, at this point starting to influence exchange, and many were undermined with conclusion. To stay away from social distress, Hackney chamber rejected the permitting confinements on 7 October 1896. In 1896, Lloyd cruised to South Africa with her girl, who showed up as meager Maudie Courtenay on a similar bill as her mom. Lloyd went to the consideration of Barney Barnato, a British business person who was in charge of mining precious stone and gold. Barnato showered endowments on her trying to charm her, yet his endeavors were ineffective; by and by, the two remained companions until his passing in 1897. The visit was a triumph for Lloyd, and her tunes wound up mainstream among her South African group of onlookers. She performed "Wink the Other Eye", "Twiggy-Vous", "Hi, Hello, Hello", "Whacky, Whacky, Whack!", "Keep Off the Grass", and "Gracious! Mr Porter". Feeling fulfilled at the achievement she had accomplished, Lloyd came back to London once the two-month visit had finished. 

The next year, Lloyd ventured out to New York where she re-showed up at Koster and Bial's Music Hall. Her first melody was about a young lady who needed trust in finding a suitor. The ensemble, "Not for the absolute best man that at any point got into a couple of pants", demonstrated silly; "The Era" saw that the line "stimulated the group of onlookers enormously". Following this, she played out a melody about a French house cleaner who seemed guiltless and petite at first sight, however turned out not to be so. "The Era" depicted the character as being "not all that coy as she looked, for she trusted to her reviewers that she 'knew a great deal about those dubious easily overlooked details they don't show a young lady at school'." Many different melodies pursued and were all heartily gotten. At the finish of every execution, she got endowments from the group of onlookers including bundles and flower structures. "The Era" remarked that "Miss Lloyd's sharp character work, her flexibility and unflagging undertakings to please were remunerated with merited achievement". After the visit, Lloyd came back to London, and moved to Hampstead with Hurley. That Christmas, she showed up in emulate, this time at the Crown Theater in Peckham in a generation of "Dick Whittington" in which she assumed the title job. In it, she sang "A Little Bit Off the Top", which MacQueen-Pope portrays as being "one of the emulate tunes of the year". "The Music Hall and Theater Review" was similarly complimentary, saying: "Splendid Repertory, Charming Dresses, A Unique Personality!" During the Christmas time of 1898â 9, Lloyd came back to the Crown where she took her advantage, amid which she showed up in "Dick Whittington". The excitement finished with a tune from Vesta Victoria, and a short piece called "The Squeaker", featuring Joe Elvin. 

In February 1900, Lloyd was the subject of another advantage execution at the Crown Theater in Peckham. Kate Carney, Vesta Tilley and Joe Elvin were among the star turns who performed before the principle piece, "Cinderella", which featured Lloyd, her sister Alice, Kittee Rayburn and Jennie Rubie. That year, in spite of the fact that her separation was not yet settled, Lloyd went to live with Hurley in Southampton Row, London. Hurley, a set up vocalist of coster tunes, routinely showed up on a similar bill as Lloyd; his quiet nature was a complexity to the injurious identity of Courtenay. Lloyd and Hurley set sail for a voyage through Australia in 1901, opening at Harry Rickards Opera House in Melbourne on 18 May with their own variant of "The Lambeth Walk". After the fruitful two-month visit, Lloyd and Hurley came back to London where she showed up in the main revue of her profession. Entitled "The Revue", it was composed by Charles Raymond and Phillip Yorke with verses by Roland Carse and music by Maurice Jacobi. It was arranged at the Tivoli theater, in festivity of the Coronation of King Edward VII. Lloyd and Courtenay's separation ended up supreme on 22 May 1905, and she wedded Hurley on 27 October 1906. Hurley, albeit delighted with his before accomplishment in Australia, started feeling sidelined by his significant other's fame. MacQueen-Pope recommended that "[Hurley] was a star who had hitched a planet. As of now the seeds of calamity were being sown." 

Soon after her marriage to Hurley, Lloyd went to Bournemouth to recover from depletion. Inside days she was back performing in London music corridors. From the beginning of the new century, music lobby artistes and theater directors had been in argument about working conditions, a decrease in pay and livens, and an expanded number of matinÃ©e exhibitions. The main huge fracture was a 1906 strike, started by the Variety Artistes' Federation. The next year, the Music Hall War started, which saw the Federation battle for more opportunity and better working conditions for the benefit of music-corridor entertainers. Albeit well sufficiently known to direction her very own charges, Lloyd bolstered the strike, went about as a picket for the strikers and offered liberally to the strike support. To raise spirits, she frequently performed on picket lines and partook in a gathering pledges act at the Scala Theater. Amid one exhibit, she remembered somebody endeavoring to enter and yelled, "Let her through, young ladies, she'll close the music corridor quicker than we can." The artist was Belle Elmore, later killed by her significant other, Dr. Crippen. The question finished later that year with a goals comprehensively positive to the entertainers. In 1909, Lloyd showed up at the Gaiety Theater in Dundee where a faultfinder for "The Courier" noticed "Her brilliant grin and captivating nearness has a lot to do with her prevalence, while her tunes are of the infectious style, maybe not what a Dundee group of onlookers knows about, yet at the same time entertaining and of an appealing style." 

Notwithstanding their conjugal issues, Lloyd went on an American visit with Hurley in 1908. She was anxious to level with the achievement of her sister Alice, who had turned out to be prevalent in the nation a couple of years already. By 1910, Marie's association with Hurley had finished, due to some degree to her unlimited gatherings and her creating fellowship with the racer Bernard Dillon, champ of the 1910 Derby. Lloyd and the youthful sportsman started an open and energetic issue. Out of the blue, her private life overshadowed her expert vocation. She was only from time to time referenced in the showy press in 1910, and when she performed, it was not to the best of her capacities. The author Arnold Bennett, who saw her dramatic at the Tivoli Theater in 1909, conceded that he "couldn't see the amazing shrewdness of the indecency of Marie Lloyd" and blamed her tunes for being "varieties of a similar subject of sexual insidiousness." As with Courtenay years already, the bashful and resigning Dillon was thinking that its difficult to adjust to Lloyd's intricate and amiable way of life. Dillon's prosperity on the racecourse was fleeting. In 1911, he was removed from the Jockey Club for getting Â£660 to wager without anyone else steeds to win. Dillon's ponies lost, and he wound up owing debtors to coaches. He wound up desirous of Lloyd's effective life in the spotlight. Wretchedness prompted drink and heftiness, and he began to mishandle her. Hurley, in the interim, had started separate from procedures, the strain of which made him drink intensely, which thus completed his dramatic vocation. Lloyd left the conjugal home in Hampstead and moved to Golders Green with Dillon, a move which MacQueen-Pope portrays as being "the most exceedingly awful thing she at any point did." 

Another show in London in 1912 exhibited the best of music lobby's ability. The Royal Command Performance occurred at the Palace Theater in London, which was overseen by Alfred Butt. The show was sorted out by Oswald Stoll, an Australian manager who dealt with a string of West End and commonplace theaters. Stoll, in spite of the fact that a devotee of Lloyd's, disdained the indecency of her demonstration and supported an arrival to an all the more family-accommodating air inside the music corridor. Along these lines, and her investment in the prior music corridor war, Stoll left her out of the line-up. He put an advert in "The Era" upon the arrival of the execution cautioning that "Coarseness and indecency and so forth are not allowedÂ ... this hint is rendered important just by a couple of specialists". In striking back, Lloyd arranged her own show at the London Pavilion, publicizing that "all of her exhibitions was a direction act by request of the British open". She performed "One Thing Leads to Another", "Gracious Mr Porter", and "The Boy I Love Is up in the Gallery" and was hailed as "the Queen of Comedy" by faultfinders. That year, she went to Devon where she showed up at the Exeter Hippodrome to much achievement. "The Devon and Exeter Gazette", revealed that Lloyd's execution of "Each Movement Tells a Tale", was "altogether delighted in" by the gathering of people and "[received] round after round of commendation". The paper likewise adulated her presentation of a "Cockney young lady's special night in Paris", which was met by "thunders of chuckling". 

In 1913, Lloyd was reserved by the Orpheum Syndicate to show up at the New York Palace Theater. She and Dillon set sail on the RMS "Olympic" under the name Mr and Mrs Dillon and were met at the American port by her sister Alice, who had dwelled in the nation for a long time. Upon landing, Lloyd and Dillon were declined section when the experts discovered that they were not hitched, as they had guaranteed while applying for passage visas. They were kept and compromised with expelling on the grounds of good turpitude and were sent to Ellis Island while an enquiry occurred. Dillon was charged under the White Slave Act with endeavoring to take into the nation a lady who was not his significant other, and Lloyd was accused of being an inactive operator. After a long enquiry, a surety of $300 each, and a forced condition that they were to live separated while in America, the couple were permitted to remain until March 1914. Alice later expressed that "the outrage of the consequent experience [while in custody] went to Marie's heart in a way she never endure. She couldn't stand to discuss that dreadful twenty-four hours." 

Notwithstanding the issues, the visit was a triumph, and Lloyd performed to pressed auditoriums all through America. Her demonstration highlighted the melodies "The Tiddly Wink", "I'd Like to Live in Paris All the Time (The Coster Girl in Paris)", and "The Aviator". The numbers were well known, halfway because of the Americanisation of every melody's verses. On an individual dimension, Lloyd's time in America was hopeless and was exacerbated by the expanding residential maltreatment she got from Dillon. The ambushes made her miss a few key exhibitions, which incensed the theater administrator, Edward Albee, who compromised her with a break of agreement activity. She guaranteed that sickness made it troublesome for her to perform and dissented at her charging position. The dramatic press were not persuaded. The "New York Telegraph" theorized "In vaudeville circles her local relations are believed to be at the base of her assaults of air." Back in England, Hurley had kicked the bucket of pleurisy and pneumonia on 6 December 1913. Lloyd heard the news while showing up in Chicago and sent a wreath with a note saying "until we meet once more". She was accounted for in "The Morning Telegraph" as saying: "With all due regard to the dead, I can merrily say that is the best bit of news I've heard in numerous years, for it implies that Bernard Dillon and I will wed when this unfortunate year closes." Lloyd wedded Dillon on 21 February 1914, the service occurring at the British Consulate in Portland, Oregon. At the point when the visit completed, Lloyd remarked, "[I will] always remember the embarrassment to which I have been oppressed and I will never sing in America again, regardless of how high the pay advertised." 

Lloyd and Dillon came back to England in June 1914. Lloyd began a commonplace voyage through Liverpool, Aldershot, Southend, Birmingham and Margate, and completed the mid year season at the London Hippodrome. She sang "The Coster Honeymoon in Paris" and "Who Paid the Rent for Mrs Rip Van Winkle?", the last of which had been gotten especially well with her American crowds. Inside a fortnight, Britain was at war, which tossed the music-lobby world into chaos. The environment in London's music corridors had turned energetic, and theater owners frequently held philanthropy occasions and advantages to help the war exertion. Lloyd had her impact and every now and again visited clinics, including the Ulster Volunteer Force Hospital in Belfast, where she cooperated with injured servicemen. She likewise visited weapons processing plants to help support open assurance, yet got no official acknowledgment for her work. Amid 1914, she scored a hit with "A Little of What you Fancy", which pundits thought caught her life superbly up until that point. The tune is about a moderately aged lady who urges the more youthful age to have fun, instead of enjoying life's fervor herself. Amid the version, Lloyd delineates a youthful couple who snuggle and kiss on a railroad carriage, while she kicks back and reviews recollections of her doing likewise in years passed by. 

In January 1915, Lloyd showed up at the Crystal Palace where she engaged more than ten thousand troops. Toward the finish of that year, she played out her solitary war tune, "Presently You've Got your Khaki On", formed for her by Charles Collins and Fred W. Leigh, about a lady who found the military uniform provocative and believed that wearing it made the normal pot-bellied refined man resemble a muscle-conditioned fighter. Lloyd's sibling John showed up with her dramatic dressed as a trooper and described the tune. Following this, she sang the officially settled melodies "On the off chance that You Want to Get On in Revue", which delineated a young lady who offered sexual favors to advance her showy vocation, and "The Three Ages of Woman", which investigated men from a lady's point of view. She only from time to time visited amid the war, yet quickly performed in Northampton, Watford and Nottingham in 1916. Before that year's over, she had endured a mental meltdown which she accused on her boisterous remaining burden and a postponed response to Hurley's demise. Amid the war years, Lloyd's open picture had weakened. Her biographer Midge Gillies suspected that Lloyd's rough association with Dillon and expert reprimands in open had left the artist feeling like "somebody's mom, as opposed to their sweetheart." 

In July 1916, Dillon was recruited into the military, yet detested the order of regimental life. He connected for exclusion on the grounds he needed to take care of his folks and four siblings, however his case was rejected. In a later fizzled endeavor, he attempted to persuade armed force authorities that he was too hefty to even consider carrying out military obligations. On the uncommon events when Dillon was permitted home on leave, he would regularly enjoy drinking sessions. One night, Lloyd's companion Bella Burge got a thump at the front way to locate a crazy Lloyd canvassed in blood and wounds. At the point when requested to clarify what had caused her wounds, she expressed that she had gotten Dillon in bed with another lady and had a standoff with her significant other. By 1917, Dillon's drinking had turned out to be more awful. That June, two constables were called to Lloyd and Dillon's home in Golders Green after Dillon submitted a plastered strike on his significant other. Police went into the house and discovered Lloyd and her servant cringing underneath a table. Dillon defied the constables and ambushed one of them, which brought about him being prosecuted, fined and condemned to a month's hard work. Lloyd started drinking to get away from the injury of her household misuse. That year, she was procuring Â£470 every week performing in music lobbies and showing up. By 1918, she had turned out to be mainstream with the British-based American officers, yet had neglected to catch the spirits of their English partners, and started feeling sidelined by her companions; Vesta Tilley had driven a fruitful enrollment crash into the administrations, and other music lobby entertainers had been respected by eminence. The next year, she performed maybe her best known melody, "My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)", which was composed for her by Fred W. Leigh and Charles Collins. The tune portrays a mother escaping her home to maintain a strategic distance from the lease man. The verses mirrored the hardships of regular workers life in London toward the start of the twentieth century, and allowed her to outfit the character in an exhausted dress and dark straw boater, while conveying a birdcage. 

In July 1919, Lloyd was again left off the cast rundown for the Royal Variety Performance, which paid tribute to the demonstrations who helped fund-raise and lift confidence amid the war years. She was crushed at the reprimand and developed unpleasant towards her adversaries who had been recognized. Her biographer Midge Gillies contrasted Lloyd with a "gifted old auntie who must be permitted to have her turn at the piano despite the fact that all everybody truly needs is jazz or go to the Picture Palace". She visited Cardiff in 1919, and in 1920 she was winning Â£11,000 per year. In spite of the high income, she was maintaining an unsustainable lifestyle, with a neglectful propensity to burn through cash. She was well known for her liberality, however was unfit to separate between those in need and the individuals who basically misused her consideration. Her unrestrained tastes, a gathering of writs from disappointed theater administrators, a powerlessness to set aside some cash, and liberal hand-outs to loved ones, brought about extreme cash inconveniences amid the last long periods of her life. 

In 1920, Lloyd showed up twice at Hendon Magistrates Court and gave proof of the maltreatment she had experienced Dillon. Before long subsequently, she isolated from him and, accordingly, ended up discouraged. At the point when asked by examiners how often Dillon had ambushed her since Christmas 1919, Lloyd answered "I can't let you know, there were such a large number of [occasions]. It has occurred for a considerable length of time, on numerous occasions, dependably when he is tanked." By now, she was ending up progressively untrustworthy in front of an audience; she showed up at a performance center in Cardiff for a minor six minutes before being stolen away by stage hands. Amid the execution, she appeared to be bewildered and confounded, and she unearthed the stage. She was aware of her feeble exhibitions and regularly cried between shows. Virginia Woolf was among the group of onlookers at the Bedford Music Hall on 8 April 1921 and portrayed Lloyd as "A mass of defilement â long front teeth â a crapulous method for saying 'want', but then a conceived craftsman â hardly ready to walk, waddling, matured, unblushing." 

In April 1922, Lloyd crumbled in her changing area in the wake of singing "The Cosmopolitan Girl" at the Gateshead Empire in Cardiff. Her specialist analyzed weariness, and she came back to the phase in August. Her voice ended up powerless, and she decreased her demonstration to an a lot shorter running time. Her biographer Naomi Jacob believed that Lloyd was "developing old, and [she] was resolved to show herself to her open as she truly wasÂ ... an old, dark confronted, tired lady". On 12 August 1921, Lloyd neglected to appear for an appearance at the London Palladium, picking rather to remain at home and keep in touch with her will. 

In mid 1922, Lloyd moved in with her sister Daisy to set aside extra cash. On 4 October, against her specialist's recommendation, she showed up at the Empire Music Hall in Edmonton, North London, where she sang "I'm One of the Ruins That Cromwell Knocked About a Bit". Her execution was frail, and she was flimsy on her feet, in the long run falling over in front of an audience. Her sporadic and brief execution demonstrated comical for the crowd, who believed that it was all piece of the demonstration. After three days, while showing up at the Alhambra Theater, she became sick in front of an audience and was discovered later in her changing area disabled with torment, griping of stomach issues. She returned home later that night, where she kicked the bucket of heart and kidney disappointment three days after the fact, matured 52. In excess of 50,000 individuals went to her burial service at Hampstead Cemetery on 12Â October 1922. Lloyd was destitute at the season of her passing and her home, which was worth Â£7,334, satisfied obligations that she and Dillon had caused throughout the years. 

Writing in "The Dial" magazine the next month, T.S. Eliot guaranteed: "Among [the] modest number of music-corridor entertainers, whose names are commonplace to what is known as the lower class, Marie Lloyd had far the most grounded hang on well known warmth." Her biographer and companion MacQueen-Pope believed that Lloyd was "going downhill of her own volition. The objection was serious, some may call it tragedy, maybe a less nostalgic conclusion is thwarted expectation." The impersonator Charles Austin paid tribute by saying "I have lost an old buddy, and the open has lost its central stage top pick, one who can never be supplanted."
