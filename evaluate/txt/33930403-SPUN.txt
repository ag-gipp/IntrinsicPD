The player controls the New Kid as he investigates the anecdotal Colorado town of South Park. The player can unreservedly move around the town albeit a few zones stay blocked off until explicit focuses in the story are come to.

Each class has explicit capacities; shield and weapons are not constrained by class, enabling a Mage to concentrate on scuffle assaults like a Fighter. 

The New Kid and his partners have an assortment of skirmish, ran, and enchantment assaults. Experience focuses remunerated for finishing undertakings and winning fights enable the New Kid to step up, opening new capacities and redesigns, for example, expanding the quantity of adversaries an assault hits or the measure of harm caused. Enchantment is spoken to by the characters' capacity to flatulate; diverse farts are utilized to achieve explicit undertakings. For instance, the "Container A-Spell" enables the player to toss a fart to collaborate with an inaccessible item, the "Nagasaki" crushes bars, and the "Subtle Squeaker" can be tossed to make a sound that occupies foes.

Every unique assault costs a set measure of "Intensity Points" or "PP" (articulated peepee) to actuate. Just a single gathering part can join the player in fight. Certain characters, for example, Tuong Lu Kim, Mr Hankey, Jesus, and Mr. Slave can be called amid fight to convey an amazing assault equipped for vanquishing a few foes at the same time; Jesus splashes harming gunfire, while Mr. Slave presses an adversary into his rectum, driving his partners off. 

One help thing can be utilized each turn, including things that reestablish wellbeing or give advantageous status impacts that improve the character's capacities. Weapons and defensive layer can be improved utilizing discretionary "tie ons, for example, counterfeit vampire teeth, bubble gum, or a Jewpacabra hook. These things can make adversaries drain and lose wellbeing, debilitate foe shield, help player wellbeing or take wellbeing from rivals, and appall enemies to make them "netted out" and cause them to upchuck. Moreover, the "tie ons" can set rivals ablaze, shock them, or stop them. A few adversaries are resistant to at least one of these impacts. Foes can divert certain assaults totally; those in a riposte position will redirect any skirmish assault, requiring the utilization of extended weapons, while those in reflect position will avoid went weapons. 

The player is urged to investigate the more extensive amusement world to discover Chinpokomon toys or new companions who are added to the character's Facebook page.

Unfit to vanquish Nazi Zombie Princess Kenny, Cartman advises Douchebag to disrupt their hallowed norm by flatulating on Kenny's balls, which he does. The subsequent blast massacres Kenny and fixes the town of the Nazi Zombie infection. In the epilog as South Park is reconstructed, the gathering recovers the Stick of Truth; they choose its capacity is unreasonably extraordinary for any individual to hold and toss it into Stark's Pond. 

Improvement of "South Park: The Stick of Truth" took four years, starting in 2009 when "South Park" co-makers Trey Parker and Matt Stone reached Obsidian Entertainment to examine their craving to make a "South Park" diversion. Parker, a fanatic of Obsidian recreations, including "" (2010), needed to make a pretending diversion, a kind which he and Stone had delighted in since their childhoods. Parker and Stone demanded that the diversion must imitate the show's visual style. Parker's unique idea was for a "South Park" form of the 2011 pretending dream amusement "", and he assessed the primary content he delivered to be 500 pages in length. The South Park Digital Studios group energized an idea of the amusement's opening scene to demonstrate what they needed to achieve with Obsidian as far as appearance and ongoing interaction mechanics. While the arrangement had enlivened a few authorized amusements, for example, "South Park" (1998) and "South Park Rally" (1999), Parker and Stone were not associated with these recreations' advancement and later condemned the titles' quality. Negative response to those recreations made the pair defensive of their property and prompted their more prominent contribution on "The Stick of Truth"; they denied a few solicitations to permit the arrangement for new pursuits. 

Stone and Parker worked intimately with Obsidian on the task, at times having a few hour gatherings more than four back to back days. They worked with Obsidian until about fourteen days before the amusement was sent. Their inclusion reached out past innovative info; their organization at first financed the amusement, trusting that a diversion dependent on the disputable TV program would battle to get budgetary help from distributers without them setting limitations on the substance to make it progressively attractive. The underlying financing was proposed to enable Obsidian to grow enough of the amusement to demonstrate an increasingly total idea to potential distributers. In December 2011, THQ declared that they would work with Obsidian on "South Park: The Game", as it was then known. This organization formed into a distributing course of action after "South Park" proprietor Viacom, having become careful about computer games, cut its subsidizing. Obsidian knew when it marked with THQ that the last was encountering monetary challenges. 

In March 2012, Microsoft dropped Obsidian's up and coming Xbox One anticipate codenamed "North Carolina" following seven months of improvement, bringing about the cutback of somewhere in the range of 20 and 30 workers, including individuals from the "Stick of Truth" group. In May 2012, the diversion's last title was reported. In December 2012, THQ petitioned for part 11 liquidation in the wake of enduring a few item discharge disappointments. "The Stick of Truth" stayed on timetable as THQ attempted to utilize the chapter 11 period to rebuild and restore its business to benefit, yet the organization neglected to discover a purchaser and a Delaware court requested that THQ was worth more if its advantages were sold independently. 

The rights to "The Stick of Truth" were sold in late December 2012; Obsidian was not made mindful of the deal until the bartering was reported. South Park Digital Studios documented a protest to the closeout, expressing that THQ did not have the expert to sell the distributing rights and that THQ had been allowed elite utilization of explicit "South Park" trademarks and copyrights. South Park Digital likewise contended that regardless of whether the rights were sold, THQ would in any case owe them and that they held the alternative of recovering all components of the amusement and "South Park" related manifestations. THQ mentioned that the court overrule South Park Digital, expressing that their rights were restrictive and in this manner transferable. On January 24, 2013, the United States liquidation court endorsed the closeout of THQ's benefits, including "The Stick of Truth". 

The rights were purchased by Ubisoft for . Inside three weeks they had chosen that the amusement required noteworthy changes, pushing its discharge go back by a half year to March 2014. Parker and Stone, with contribution from a Ubisoft inventive specialist, inferred that their unique vision would take excessively long and would be too exorbitant to even think about producing. In a 2014 meeting, Obsidian pioneer Feargus Urquhart said he couldn't remark on changes that were made after Ubisoft's contribution. "South Park: The Stick of Truth" was formally discharged to assembling on February 12, 2014. Following its discharge, Stone said that the work associated with making the amusement was substantially more than he and Parker had foreseen. He stated, "I'll [admit] to the way that we retooled stuff that we didn't care for and we chipped away at the amusement longer than other individuals would've preferred us to". 

Amid early dialogs with Obsidian, Parker and Stone were determined that the diversion ought to reliably reproduce the show's remarkable 2D-style visuals, which depend on pattern liveliness. Obsidian gave verifications of idea that they could accomplish the "South Park" look; Stone and Parker were happy with this. The show is energized utilizing Autodesk Maya, yet Obsidian created the diversion resources and activitys in Adobe Flash. "Skyrim" was the amusement's underlying impact and further motivation originated from the 1994 pretending diversion "Terrestrial". Parker and Stone said that the mixed 2D/3D visuals of "Paper Mario" and the quiet hero Link from "The Legend of Zelda" arrangement likewise given motivation to the structure. The characters' outfits and classes are taken from the 2002 "South Park" scene "The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers". Obsidian made different dream styled things, defensive layer, and weapons however Parker and Stone guided them to "make it crappier" to make the feeling that the kids had found or made the items themselves; weapons comprised of golf clubs, hammers, suction container bolts and wooden swords, while wraparounds, broiler glove gloves, and towels worn as capes filled in as dress. "South Park" studios furnished Obsidian with access to the show's full chronicle of workmanship resources, enabling Obsidian to incorporate beforehand unused thoughts, for example, disposed of Chinpokomon plans. Performing artists from the show gave voice work, and Obsidian was offered access to "South Park"s sound assets, including audio effects, music, and the show's author Jamie Dunlap. 

Portraying the composition of a parody content for an amusement in which lines of exchange might be heard more than once and jokes could seem dated, Stone stated: 

We compose jokes, and the jokes are interesting. With a diversion, the fourth, fifth, 6th, 80th, 100 millionth time you've seen that joke it ends up not entertaining, at that point you lose confidence in it, and afterward you question it, and you go round this passionate circleÂ ...Â We've constantly loved new prepared stuff somewhat better in any case, with a computer game, it doesn't work that way. In any case, the diversion isn't only a gathering of amusing "South Park" scenes, ideally it's more than that. 

Like the show, "The Stick of Truth" parodies political and social issues including premature birth, race relations, butt-centric tests, illicit drug use, sex, extraordinary viciousness, and destitution. Inventive advisor Jordan Thomas stated, "The manner in which we took a gander at [humor] was if this minute was a hot catch for the group of onlookers, should we exacerbate it, on the grounds that [Stone and Parker] love to push limits and their default reaction was unquestionably not to withdraw, however the extremely sound offset was, would we be able to make it funnierand the appropriate response was frequently yes". 

The diversion experienced a few changes amid its advancement. While the last amusement highlights four playable character types (Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Jew), an early form included five playable classes: Paladin, Wizard, Rogue, Adventurer, and Jew. The last was portrayed as a hybrid of a Monk and a Paladin, that is "high hazard, high reward" and most grounded when nearest to death. The amusement had included different foes and areas, including vampire kids who were battled in a burial ground and church, radicals, a mission to recuperate Cartman's doll from the Ginger youngsters, and manager battles against an extensive, winged beast, and big name Paris Hiltonher primary assault being known as the "vag impact". The Crab People had a bigger job and imparted a peaceful area to the Underpants Gnomesonly one Crab Person shows up in the last gameand Mr Hankey and his family lived in a vast, Christmas-themed town which turned into a little house in the town's sewers. Urquhart later said that when improvement started, computer games were less ensured by the right to speak freely laws than other media, confining the substance that could be incorporated into "The Stick of Truth". While under THQ's distributing bargain, the engineers arranged that the Xbox 360 variant would bolster the comfort's info gadget, Kinect, empowering players to give characters voice directions, insult adversaries, and affront Cartmanto which the character would react. Selective Xbox 360 downloadable substance (DLC) including the "Mysterion Superhero" pack and "Great Times with Weapons" packs each highlighting an extraordinary weapon, outfit, and unique assault, and three story-based crusade extensions was reported. These highlights were absent in the Ubisoft discharge.

It was discharged on March 6 in Australia and on March 7 in Europe. The amusement had been planned for discharge on March 5, 2013, however this was deferred two months by then-distributer THQ. After THQ declared financial insolvency in January 2013, Ubisoft obtained the rights to distribute the amusement and did not indicate a discharge date. By May 2013, Ubisoft had affirmed that it would be discharged that year after it was precluded from their up and coming diversions discharge plan. On September 26, 2013, Ubisoft reported that "The Stick of Truth" would be discharged in December 2013, however in October 2013 the diversion's discharge was again deferred until March 2014. The diversion was planned for discharge on March 6, 2014 in Germany and Austria, yet it was postponed after the limited rendition of the amusement was found to contain Nazi references. Nearby the Steam variant of the diversion, "The Stick of Truth" got an advanced download discharge for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on June 13, 2016.

An independent physical and computerized download was discharged on for February 13, 2018, for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A Nintendo Switch form, accessible as a computerized download, was discharged on September 25, 2018.

Extra substance incorporated the "Super Samurai Spaceman" pack containing three outfits; the Superhero ensemble gives a buff toward the beginning of fight, the Samurai ensemble gives a buff on vanquishing an adversary, and the Spaceman outfit gives a cautious shield. 

In November and December 2013, the "South Park" TV arrangement included "The day after Thanksgiving" set of three of episodes"Black Friday", "A Song of Ass and Fire", and "Titties and Dragons"which was an account prequel to the diversion and highlighted the characters destroying outfits and acting jobs like those in the amusement. The scenes caricaturized the diversion's long improvement; in "The day after Thanksgiving" Cartman advises Kyle not to "pre-request an amusement that a few butt nuggets in California haven't got done with making yet", alluding to California-based Obsidian, while "Titties and Dragons" finishes up with a commercial reporting the diversion's discharge date joined by Butters pronouncing his distrust. Talking about "The day after Thanksgiving", IGN said that it "felt like a sneak look" of the diversion and if nothing else, was "great advertising" in light of the amusement's various postponements. 

In the blink of an eye before the amusement's discharge, Ubisoft declared that it would deliberately edit seven scenes, considering it a "showcase choice made by Ubisoft EMEA" and not a reaction to include from blue pencils. PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 renditions were influenced in European regions, the Middle East, Africa, and Russia, while the Microsoft Windows form stayed uncensored. The oversight influenced all configurations in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Germany, Austria, and Taiwan. The North American discharge was the main form that was uncensored on all configurations.

A representative for the European computer game substance rating framework Pan European Game Information (PEGI) affirmed that the uncensored adaptation had been submitted and endorsed for discharge with a 18 rating, which means the diversion would be worthy for individuals more than eighteen years old. Ubisoft resubmitted the blue-penciled adaptation without contribution from PEGI; this variant was passed with a 18-rating. 

The scenes Ubisoft evacuated delineate butt-centric examining by outsiders and the player-character playing out a premature birth. In their place, the diversion shows a still picture of a statue grasping its face, with an unequivocal portrayal of occasions delineated in the scene. In Australia, similar scenes were evacuated in light of the fact that the Australian Classification Board would not rate the amusement for discharge because of the delineation of sexual violencespecifically the kid player-character being exposed to butt-centric examining and the intelligent fetus removal scene. Like the European form, these scenes were supplanted with a placeholder card with a clarification of what was expelled on a foundation picture of a koala crying. 

Talking about the circumstance, Stone said he had been told changes were required for the diversion to be discharged and that he and Parker embedded the placeholder pictures so the restriction would not be covered up. He considered the control a twofold standard that the pair opposed, and said he felt it didn't destroy the amusement and the cards enabled them to taunt the changes. A post-discharge client made diversion adjustment was discharged for the Microsoft Windows form that crippled the control. 

"South Park: The Stick of Truth" got positive audits from faultfinders. Conglomerating survey site Metacritic gives a score of 85 out of 100 from 48 commentators for the Microsoft Windows adaptation, 85 out of 100 from 31 pundits for the PlayStation 3 form, and 82 out of 100 from 33 faultfinders for the Xbox 360 rendition.

Destructoid said that the capacity to stroll around the definite town gave a feeling of wonderment like investigating The Simpsons main residence in "". The visual interpretation was featured as a huge part of the diversion's prosperity, seeming undefined from a scene of the show and giving a reliable tasteful that stayed loyal to the arrangement while being unique to gaming. A few analysts said that the craftsmanship style was incidentally hindering, clouding items and prompts, and that redundant utilization of activitys became stale through the span of the diversion. "PC and Video Games" said that Obsidian had constructed a diversion world that appeared as if it had dependably existed.

Joystiq expressed that barrier was more fascinating than offense since it depended on time-touchy responses to innovative foe assaults, for example, Al Gore giving an introduction. Destructoid said there are excessively few forces accessible for offense for the amusement to stay intriguing for long. GameSpot discovered battle was excessively simple and ailing in test in light of a wealth of enhancement things, for example, wellbeing packs that were discovered more every now and again than they were utilized, and amazing capacities that immediately quelled rivals. Others dissented, expressing that the assortment offered in battle, for example, character capacities, partners, weapons, reinforcement, and updates, guaranteed it generally felt fun. The impacts of the improvements were now and then viewed as confounding, and commonly depending on basically preparing the most elevated amount thing accessible. Joystiq said the unique characters that can be brought amid fight were outrageous as far as power and excitement esteem. 

IGN said that the distinction between character classes, for example, Thief and Jew were disappointingly insignificant, offering little assortment or motivator to replay as another class. IGN additionally said a few missions and side journeys were dreary, and were raised by their setting instead of their quality, while the analyst thought the ecological riddles were a cunning choice for dodging battle and were sufficiently uncommon to be charming when accessible. In any case, GameSpot said the riddles felt scripted and straightforward. Commentators said that a large number of the interactivity capacities and controls were inadequately clarified, making them hard to enact; others were condemning of inordinate stacking times after entering new areas and moderate menus, for example, the Facebook board.
