Alan Shepard 

Back Admiral Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr. (November 18, 1923 â July 21, 1998) was an American space traveler, maritime pilot, aircraft tester, and representative. In 1961 he turned into the main American to go into space, and in 1971 he strolled on the Moon. 

An alum of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Shepard saw activity with the surface naval force amid World War II. He turned into a maritime pilot in 1946, and an aircraft tester in 1950. He was chosen as one of the first NASA Mercury Seven space explorers in 1959, and in May 1961 he made the main kept an eye on Project Mercury flight, MR-3, in a shuttle he named "Opportunity 7". His specialty entered space, yet was not fit for accomplishing circle. He turned into the second individual, and the main American, to go into space, and the principal space explorer to physically control the introduction of his specialty. In the last phases of Project Mercury, Shepard was booked to steer the Mercury-Atlas 10 (MA-10), which was arranged as a three-day mission. He named Mercury Spacecraft 15B "Opportunity 7 II" out of appreciation for his first rocket, however the mission was dropped. 

Shepard was assigned as the officer of the main kept an eye on Project Gemini mission, however was grounded in 1963 because of MÃ©niÃ¨re's infection, an inward ear sickness that caused scenes of extraordinary wooziness and queasiness. This was precisely remedied in 1969, and in 1971, Shepard told the Apollo 14 mission, directing the Apollo Lunar Module "Antares" to the most exact arriving of the Apollo missions. At age 47, he turned into the fifth, the most seasoned, and the soonest conceived individual to stroll on the Moon, and the just a single of the Mercury Seven space explorers to do as such. Amid the mission, he hit two golf balls on the lunar surface. He was Chief of the Astronaut Office from November 1963 to July 1969 (the estimated time of his establishing), and from June 1971 until his retirement from the United States Navy and NASA on August 1, 1974. He was elevated to raise naval commander on August 25, 1971, the main space explorer to achieve that position. 

Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr. was conceived on November 18, 1923, in Derry, New Hampshire, to Alan B. Shepard Sr. what's more, Pauline Renza Shepard (). He had a more youthful sister, Pauline, who was known as Polly. He was one of numerous celebrated relatives of "Mayflower" traveler Richard Warren. His dad, Alan B. Shepard Sr., known as Bart, worked in the Derry National Bank, claimed by Shepard's granddad. Alan Sr. joined the National Guard in 1915 and served in France with the American Expeditionary Force amid World War I. He stayed in the National Guard between the wars, and was reviewed to dynamic obligation amid World War II, ascending to the position of lieutenant colonel. 

Shepard went to Adams School in Derry, where his scholastic execution awed his educators; he avoided the 6th level, and continued to center school at Oak Street School in Derry, where he skirted the eighth level. In 1936, he went to the Pinkerton Academy, a tuition based school in Derry that his dad had visited and where his granddad had been a trustee. He finished years 9 to 12 there. Intrigued by flight, he made a model plane club at the Academy, and his Christmas present in 1938 was a trip in a Douglas DC-3. The next year he started cycling to Manchester Airfield, where he would do random temp jobs in return for the incidental ride in a plane or casual flying exercise. 

Shepard moved on from Pinkerton Academy in 1940. Since World War II was at that point seething in Europe, his dad needed him to join the Army. Shepard picked the Navy. He effectively passed the selection test to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1940, however at sixteen was too youthful to even think about entering that year. The Navy sent him to the Admiral Farragut Academy, a private academy for the Naval Academy, from which he graduated with the class of 1941. Tests managed at Farragut demonstrated an IQ of 145, yet his evaluations were unremarkable. 

At Annapolis, Shepard appreciated oceanic games. He was a sharp and focused mariner, winning a few races, including a regatta held by the Annapolis Yacht Club. He figured out how to cruise every one of the kinds of pontoons the foundation claimed, up to and including , a yacht. He additionally took an interest in swimming, and paddled with the eight. Amid his Christmas break in 1942, he went to Principia College to be with his sister, who was unfit to return home inferable from wartime travel confinements. There he met Louise Brewer, whose guardians were beneficiaries on the du Pont family home, and, as Renza Shepard, were ardent Christian Scientists. Inferable from the war, the typical four-year course at Annapolis was stopped by a year, and he graduated and was charged as an ensign on June 6, 1944, positioned 463rd in his class of 915. The next month he turned out to be covertly connected with to Louise. In 1944 he got a Bachelor of Science at the United States Naval Academy. 

Following a month of study hall guidance in flight, Shepard was presented on a destroyer, , in August 1944; it was US Navy approach that avionics hopefuls should initially have some administration adrift. At the time the destroyer was conveyed on dynamic administration in the Pacific Ocean. Shepard went along with it when it came back to the maritime base at Ulithi on October 30. After only two days adrift "Cogswell" helped salvage 172 mariners from the cruiser , which had been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, at that point escorted the injured ship back to Ulithi. The ship was struck by Typhoon Cobra in December 1944, a tempest in which three different destroyers went down, and fought kamikazes in the intrusion of Lingayen Gulf in January 1945. 

"Cogswell" came back to the United States for an upgrade in February 1945. Shepard was given three weeks' leave, in which time he and Louise chose to wed. The service occurred on March 3, 1945, in St. Stephen's Lutheran Church in Wilmington, Delaware. His dad, Bart, filled in as his best man. The love birds had just a concise time together before Shepard rejoined "Cogswell" at the Long Beach Navy Yard on April 5, 1945. After the war, they had two youngsters, the two little girls: Laura, conceived in 1947, and Julie, conceived in 1951. Following the demise of Louise's sister in 1956, they raised her five-year-old niece, Judith Williamsâwhom they renamed Alice to stay away from disarray with Julieâas their own, despite the fact that they never received her. They inevitably had six grandkids. 

On Shepard's second journey with "Cogswell", he was designated a gunnery officer, in charge of the 20Â mm and 40Â mm antiaircraft weapons on the ship's bow. They drew in kamikazes in the Battle of Okinawa, where the ship served in the risky job of a radar picket. The activity of the radar pickets was to caution the armada of approaching kamikazes, but since they were regularly the primary boats located by approaching Japanese air ship, they were likewise the no doubt ships to be assaulted. "Cogswell" played out this obligation from May 27, 1945, until June 26, when it rejoined Task Force 38. The ship likewise took part in the Allied maritime bombardments of Japan, and was available in Tokyo Bay for the Surrender of Japan in September 1945. Shepard came back to the United States soon thereafter. 

In November 1945, Shepard touched base at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas, where he started essential flight preparing on January 7, 1946. He was a normal understudy, and for a period confronted being "bilged" (dropped) from flight preparing and reassigned to the surface naval force. To compensate for this, he took private exercises at a nearby regular citizen flying schoolâsomething the Navy disapproved ofâwinning a common pilot's permit. His flying abilities continuously improved, and by mid 1947 his educators evaluated him better than expected. He was sent to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida for cutting edge preparing. His last test was six ideal arrivals on the transporter . The next day, he got his maritime pilot wings, which his dad stuck on his chest. 

Shepard was doled out to Fighter Squadron 42 (VF-42), flying the Vought F4U Corsair. The squadron was ostensibly founded on the plane carrying warship , however the ship was being upgraded at the time Shepard arrived, and meanwhile the squadron was based at Naval Air Station Norfolk in Virginia. He left on his first journey, of the Caribbean, on "Franklin D. Roosevelt" with VF-42 of every 1948. The vast majority of the pilots were, similar to Shepard, on their first task. The individuals who were not were allowed the chance to fit the bill for night arrivals on a bearer, a risky move, particularly in a Corsair, which needed to bank strongly on methodology. Shepard figured out how to convince his squadron administrator to enable him to qualify too. After quickly coming back to Norfolk, the transporter set out on a nine-month voyage through the Mediterranean Sea. He earned a notoriety for cutting loose and pursuing ladies. He likewise initiated a custom of, at whatever point he could, calling Louise at 17:00 (her time) every day. 

Typically ocean obligation exchanged with times of obligation aground. In 1950, Shepard was chosen to go to the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. As an aircraft tester he led high-height tests to get data about the light and air masses at various elevations over North America; bearer reasonableness accreditation of the McDonnell F2H Banshee; tries different things with the Navy's new in-flight refueling framework; and trial of the calculated flight deck. He barely abstained from being court-martialed by the station leader, Rear Admiral Alfred M. Pride, subsequent to circling the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and making low ignores the shoreline at Ocean City, Maryland, and the base; however Shepard's bosses, John Hyland and Robert M. Senior, mediated on his sake. 

Shepard's next task was to VF-193, a night contender squadron flying the Banshee, that was based at Naval Air Station Moffett Field, California. The squadron was a piece of Commander James D. "Dance Dog" Ramage's Air Group 19. Maritime pilots with involvement in fly airplane were still moderately uncommon, and Ramage explicitly mentioned Shepard's task on the exhortation of Elder, who told VF-193's sister squadron, VF-191. Ramage made Shepard his very own wingman, a choice that would spare Ramage's life in 1954, when his oxygen framework fizzled and Shepard talked him through an arrival. As squadron activities officer, Shepard's most imperative assignment was bestowing his insight into flying planes to his kindred pilots to keep them alive. He served two visits on the plane carrying warship in the western Pacific. It set out on a battle visit off Korea in 1953, amid the Korean War, yet the Korean Armistice Agreement finished the battling in July 1953, and Shepard did not see battle. 

Back Admiral John P. Whitney mentioned Shepard's administrations as a confidant, however Shepard needed to fly. Accordingly, at Shepard's solicitation, Ramage addressed the chief of naval operations for his sake, and Shepard was rather sent back to Patuxent. He flight tried the McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, Douglas F4D Skyray and Grumman F-11 Tiger. The Vought F7U Cutlass would in general go into a rearranged turn amid a snap roll. This was not uncommon; numerous air ship did this, yet typically if the pilot let go of the stick the flying machine would address itself. When he endeavored this in the F7U, Shepard discovered this was not the situation. He was unfit to break out of the turn and was compelled to discharge. In 1957, he was venture aircraft tester on the Douglas F5D Skylancer. Shepard disliked the plane, and gave it an ominous report. The Navy dropped orders for it, purchasing the F8U. He additionally recorded a horrible report on the F11F after a nerve racking occurrence in which the motor flopped on him amid a rapid jump. Luckily, he figured out how to restart the motor. 

Shepard was an educator at the Test Pilot School, and after that entered the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island. He graduated in 1957, and moved toward becoming as Aircraft Readiness Officer on the staff of the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet. At this point he had logged over 3,600 hours of flying time, incorporating 1,700 hours in planes. 

On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union propelled Sputnik 1, the main counterfeit satellite. This broke American trust in its mechanical predominance, making an influx of uneasiness known as the Sputnik emergency. Among his reactions, President Dwight D. Eisenhower propelled the Space Race. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was built up on October 1, 1958, as a non military personnel office to create space innovation. One of its first activities was freely declared on December 17, 1958. This was Project Mercury, which planned to dispatch a man into Earth circle, return him securely to the Earth, and assess his capacities in space. 

NASA got consent from Eisenhower to select its first space travelers from the positions of military aircraft testers. The administration records of 508 alumni of aircraft tester schools were acquired from the United States Department of Defense. From these, 110 were discovered that coordinated the base guidelines: the hopefuls must be more youthful than 40, have a four year college education or proportionate and to be or less. While these were not all carefully authorized, the tallness necessity was firm, attributable to the span of the Project Mercury rocket. The 110 were then part into three gatherings, with the most encouraging in the primary gathering. 

The main gathering of 35, which included Shepard, amassed at the Pentagon on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were invited by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, while the United States Air Force officers were tended to by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Thomas D. White. Both vowed their help to the Space Program, and guaranteed that the vocations of volunteers would not be antagonistically influenced. NASA authorities at that point advised them on Project Mercury. They yielded that it would be an unsafe endeavor, yet accentuated that it was of extraordinary national significance. That night, Shepard talked about the day's occasions with individual maritime pilots Jim Lovell, Pete Conrad and Wally Schirra, every one of whom would inevitably move toward becoming space explorers. They were worried about their professions, however chose to volunteer. 

The instructions procedure was rehashed with a second gathering of 34 hopefuls every week later. Of the 69, six were observed to be over as far as possible, 15 were dispensed with for different reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 applicants. Since this was more than anticipated, NASA chose not to mess with the rest of the 41 competitors, as 32 hopefuls appeared a more than sufficient number from which to choose 12 space travelers as arranged. The level of intrigue likewise shown that far less would drop out amid preparing than foreseen, which would bring about preparing space explorers who might not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was in this way chosen to cut the quantity of space travelers chose to only six. At that point came a difficult arrangement of physical and mental tests at the Lovelace Clinic and the Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory. Just a single hopeful, Lovell, was disposed of on restorative grounds at this stage, and the finding was later observed to be in blunder; thirteen others were prescribed with reservations. The chief of the NASA Space Task Group, Robert R. Gilruth, got himself unfit to choose just six from the staying eighteen, and at last seven were picked. 

Shepard was educated of his choice on April 1, 1959. After two days he made a trip to Boston with Louise for the wedding of his cousin Anne, and had the capacity to break the news to his folks and sister. The personalities of the seven were declared at a public interview at Dolley Madison House in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959: Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton. The size of the test in front of them was clarified half a month later, the evening of May 18, 1959, when the seven space explorers assembled at Cape Canaveral to watch their first rocket dispatch, of a SM-65D Atlas, which was like the one that was to convey them into space. A couple of minutes after liftoff, it tremendously detonated, illuminating the night sky. The space explorers were shocked. Shepard swung to Glenn and stated: "Well, I'm happy they got that off the beaten path." 

Looked with extraordinary challenge from different space explorers, especially John Glenn, Shepard quit smoking and embraced Glenn's propensity for taking a morning run, in spite of the fact that he went poorly far as to surrender the mixed drinks or the philandering. On January 19, 1961, Robert R. Gilruth, the chief of NASA's Space Task Group, educated the seven space travelers that Shepard had been decided for the main American kept an eye on mission into space. Shepard later reviewed Louise's reaction when he revealed to her that she had her arms around the man who might be the main man in space: "Who let a Russian in here?" During preparing he flew 120 mimicked flights. Despite the fact that his flight was initially booked for April 26, 1960, it was delayed a few times by spontaneous preliminary work, at first to December 5, 1960, at that point mid-January 1961, March 6, 1961, April 25, 1961, May 2, 1961, lastly to May 5, 1961. On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin turned into the main individual in space, and the first to circle the Earth. It was another body hit to American pride. At the point when Shepard heard the news he pummeled his clench hand down on a table so hard a NASA open connection officer dreaded he may have broken it. 

On May 5, 1961, Shepard directed the Mercury-Redstone 3 mission and turned into the second individual, and the principal American, to go into space. He named his shuttle, Mercury Spacecraft 7, "Opportunity 7". It was propelled on a Redstone rocket. As per Gene Kranz in his book "Disappointment Is Not an Option", "When journalists got some information about as he sat on the Redstone rocket, hanging tight for liftoff, he had answered, 'The way that all aspects of this ship was worked by the most minimal bidder.'". 

Not at all like Gagarin's 108-minute orbital trip in a Vostok rocket multiple times the measure of "Opportunity 7", Shepard remained on a suborbital direction for the 15-minute flight, which achieved an elevation of , and after that tumbled to a splashdown down the Atlantic Missile Range. In contrast to Gagarin, whose flight was carefully programmed, Shepard had some control of "Opportunity 7", rocket frame of mind specifically. Shepard's dispatch was seen live on TV by millions. 

One thing that was not seen at the time by the open was Shepard's pre-dispatch "crisis". Since the whole voyage was just expected to take fifteen minutes, Shepard's suit did not have any arrangement for end of substantial squanders. Subsequent to being tied into the case's seat, dispatch defers kept him in that suit for eight hours; Shepard's perseverance gave out before dispatch, and he was compelled to purge his bladder into the suit, which shorted out the medicinal sensors connected to it to follow the space traveler's condition in flight. After Shepard's flight, NASA brought in the space suit's maker, B. F. Goodrich, and when of John Glenn's Mercury-Atlas 6 orbital flight the next year, a fluid waste gathering highlight had been incorporated with the suit. 

After a sensational Atlantic Ocean recuperation, Commander Shepard saw that he "...Â didn't generally feel the flight was a triumph until the recuperation had been effectively finished. It's not the fall that harms; it's the unexpected stop." Splashdown happened with an effect tantamount to getting a fly air ship on a plane carrying warship. A recuperation helicopter touched base following a couple of minutes, and the container was lifted incompletely out of the water to enable Shepard to leave by the principle bring forth. He pressed out of the entryway and into a sling lift, and was maneuvered into the helicopter, which flew both the space traveler and shuttle to the plane carrying warship . The entire recuperation process took only eleven minutes. Shepard was commended as a national saint, respected with ticker-tape marches in Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and got the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President John F. Kennedy. He was likewise granted the Distinguished Flying Cross. 

Shepard filled in as case communicator (CAPCOM) for Glenn's Mercury-Atlas 6 orbital flight, which he had likewise been considered for, and Carpenter's Mercury-Atlas 7. He was the reinforcement pilot for Cooper for the Mercury-Atlas 9 mission, almost supplanting Cooper after Cooper flew low over the NASA organization working at Cape Canaveral in a F-106. In the last phases of Project Mercury, Shepard was booked to steer the Mercury-Atlas 10 (MA-10), which was arranged as a three-day mission. He named Mercury Spacecraft 15B "Opportunity 7 II" to pay tribute to his first rocket, and had the name painted on it, yet on June 12, 1963, NASA Administrator James E. Webb declared that Mercury had achieved every one of its objectives and no more missions would be flown. Shepard went the extent that creation an individual intrigue to President Kennedy, yet without much of any result. 

Task Gemini pursued on from Project Mercury, taking its name from the way that it conveyed two men rather than only one. After the Mercury-Atlas 10 mission was dropped, Shepard was assigned as the authority of the principal kept an eye on Gemini mission, with Thomas P. Stafford picked as his pilot. In late 1963, Shepard started to encounter scenes of outrageous wooziness and queasiness, joined by a noisy, thumping clamor in the left ear. He attempted to keep it mystery, expecting that he would lose his flight status, however knew that if a scene happened noticeable all around or in space it could be deadly. Following a scene amid an address in Houston, where he had as of late moved from Virginia Beach, Virginia, Shepard was compelled to admit his infirmity to Slayton, who was presently Director of Flight Operations, and look for assistance from NASA's specialists. 

The specialists analyzed MÃ©niÃ¨re's malady, a condition in which liquid weight develops in the internal ear. This disorder causes the crescent trenches and movement indicators to turn out to be amazingly delicate, bringing about bewilderment, dazedness, and queasiness. There was no known fix, however in around 20 percent of cases the condition left without anyone else. They recommended diuretics trying to empty the liquid out of the ear. They likewise analyzed glaucoma. A X-beam found a protuberance on his thyroid, and on January 17, 1964, specialists at Hermann Hospital made an entry point on his throat and expelled 20 percent of his thyroid. The condition made Shepard be expelled from flight status. Grissom and John Young flew Gemini 3. 

Shepard was assigned Chief of the Astronaut Office in November 1963. He in this manner wound up in charge of NASA space traveler preparing. This included the advancement of fitting preparing programs for all space explorers and the booking of preparing of individual space travelers for explicit missions and jobs. He gave and facilitated space explorer contribution to mission arranging and the plan of shuttle and other gear to be utilized by space travelers on space missions. He likewise was on the determination board for the NASA Astronaut Group 5 out of 1966. He invested quite a bit of his energy putting resources into banks, wildcatting, and land. He turned out to be part proprietor and VP of Baytown National Bank and would invest hours on the telephone in his NASA office directing it. He likewise purchased an organization in a farm in Weatherford, Texas, that raised ponies and steers. Amid this period, his secretary had a few head shot photos taken of Shepard, presented with different looks all over. She would post these on the way to his private office, with a sign which said "State of mind of the Day". Guests could then take a gander at the photograph to choose whether it was a decent time to converse with him. Tom Wolfe portrayed Shepard's double identities as "Smilin' Al" and the "Frosty Commander". "Inside his storage", Wolfe stated, "he kept Smilin' Al of the Cape!" 

In 1968, Stafford ceased by Shepard's office and revealed to him that an otologist in Los Angeles had built up a solution for MÃ©niÃ¨re's malady. Shepard traveled to Los Angeles, where he met with Dr. William F. House. House proposed to open Shepard's mastoid bone and make a little gap in the endolymphatic sac. A little cylinder was embedded to deplete abundance liquid. The medical procedure was led in mid 1969 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles, where Shepard checked in under the alias Victor Poulos. The medical procedure was effective, and he was reestablished to full flight status on May 7, 1969. 

Shepard and Slayton put Shepard down to direction the following accessible Moon mission, which was Apollo 13 of every 1970. Under ordinary conditions, this task would have gone to Cooper, as the reinforcement authority of Apollo 10, however Cooper was cleared aside. A new kid on the block, Stuart Roosa, was assigned the Command Module Pilot. Shepard requested Jim McDivitt as his Lunar Module Pilot, yet McDivitt, who had just instructed the Apollo 9 mission, scoffed at the prospect, contending that Shepard did not have adequate Apollo preparing to direction a Moon mission. A new kid on the block, Edgar Mitchell, was assigned the Lunar Module Pilot. 

At the point when Slayton presented the proposed group assignments to NASA central command, George Mueller turned them down because the team was excessively unpracticed. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, who had been the reinforcement authority for Apollo 11, and was slated to order Apollo 14, if his group would fly Apollo 13. He consented to do as such, and Shepard's unpracticed group was allocated to Apollo 14. 

Neither Shepard nor Lovell expected there would be much contrast between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, yet Apollo 13 turned out badly. An oxygen tank blast caused the Moon arrival to be prematurely ended and about brought about the loss of the team. It turned into a joke among Shepard and Lovell, who might offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they found one another. The disappointment of Apollo 13 postponed Apollo 14 until 1971 with the goal that changes could be made to the shuttle. The objective of the Apollo 14 mission was changed to the Fra Mauro development, the expected goal of Apollo 13. 

Shepard made his second space trip as Commander of Apollo 14 from January 31 to February 9, 1971. It was America's third fruitful lunar landing mission. Shepard directed the Lunar Module "Antares" to the most exact arriving of the whole Apollo program. He turned into the fifth and, at 47 years old, the most seasoned man to stroll on the Moon, and the just a single of the Mercury Seven space travelers to do as such. 

This was the main mission to communicate broad shading TV inclusion from the lunar surface, utilizing the Westinghouse Lunar Color Camera. (A similar shading camera display was utilized on Apollo 12 and gave around 30 minutes of shading broadcasting before it was incidentally pointed at the Sun, finishing its convenience.) While on the Moon, Shepard utilized a Wilson six-iron head joined to a lunar example scoop handle to drive golf balls. Regardless of thick gloves and a hardened spacesuit, which constrained him to swing the club with one hand, Shepard struck two golf balls, driving the second, as he playfully put it, "miles and miles and miles". 

For this mission Shepard was granted the NASA Distinguished Service Medal and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. His reference read: 

Following Apollo 14, Shepard came back to his situation as Chief of the Astronaut Office in June 1971. In July 1971 President Richard Nixon designated him as a representative to the 26th United Nations General Assembly, a situation in which he served from September to December 1971. He was elevated to raise chief of naval operations by Nixon on August 26, 1971, the principal space traveler to achieve this position, despite the fact that McDivitt had recently been elevated to brigadier general in the Air Force. He resigned from both NASA and the Navy on July 31, 1974. 

Shepard was dedicated to his kids. Habitually Julie, Laura and Alice were the main space travelers' youngsters at NASA occasions. He instructed them to ski and took them skiing in Colorado. He once leased a little plane to fly them and their companions from Texas to a mid year camp in Maine. He hovered over his six grandkids also. After Apollo 14 he started to invest more energy with Louise, and began taking her with him on excursions to the Paris Air Show each other year, and to Asia. Louise heard bits of gossip about his issues. The production of Tom Wolfe's 1979 book "The Right Stuff" made them open information, however she never stood up to him about it, nor did she ever ponder abandoning him. 

After Shepard left NASA, he served on the sheets of numerous enterprises. He likewise filled in as leader of his umbrella organization for a few business ventures, Seven Fourteen Enterprises, Inc. (named for his two flights, "Opportunity 7" and Apollo 14). He made a fortune in banking and land. He was an individual of the American Astronautical Society and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, an individual from Rotary, Kiwanis, the Mayflower Society, the Order of the Cincinnati, and the American Fighter Aces, a privileged individual from the Board of Directors for the Houston School for Deaf Children, and an executive of the National Space Institute and the Los Angeles Ear Research Institute. Together with the other enduring Mercury space travelers, and Betty Grissom, Gus Grissom's widow, in 1984 Shepard established the Mercury Seven Foundation, which fund-raises to give school grants to science and designing understudies. It was renamed the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation in 1995. Shepard was chosen its first president and director, positions he held until October 1997, when he was prevailing by previous space explorer Jim Lovell. 

In 1994, he distributed a book with two writers, Jay Barbree and Howard Benedict, called "". Individual Mercury space explorer Deke Slayton is additionally named as a creator. The book incorporated a composite photo demonstrating Shepard hitting a golf ball on the Moon. There are no still pictures of this occasion; the main record is TV film. The book was transformed into a TV miniseries in 1994. 

Shepard was determined to have leukemia in 1996 and kicked the bucket from inconveniences of the illness in Pebble Beach, California, on July 21, 1998. He was the second space explorer who had strolled on the Moon to bite the dust, Jim Irwin being the first, in 1991. Shepard's widow Louise made plans to incinerate his remaining parts and dissipate the powder, however she kicked the bucket from a heart assault on August 25, 1998, at 17:00, the time at which he had dependably called her. They had been hitched for a long time. The family chose to incinerate them both, and their fiery debris were dissipated together by a Navy helicopter over Stillwater Cove, before their Pebble Beach home. 

Shepard was granted the Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Jimmy Carter on October 1, 1978. He additionally got the Golden Plate Award for Science and Exploration in 1981; the Langley Gold Medal on May 5, 1964; the John J. Montgomery Award in 1963; the Lambert trophy; the SETP Iven C. Kincheloe Award; the Cabot Award; the Collier Trophy; and the City of New York Gold Medal for 1971. He was granted an Honorary degrees of Master of Arts from Dartmouth College in 1962, D.Sc. from Miami University in 1971, and Doctorate of Humanities from Franklin Pierce College in 1972. He was drafted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1977, the International Space Hall of Fame in 1981, and the U.S. Space traveler Hall of Fame on May 11, 1990. 

The Navy named a supply deliver, , for him in 2006. The McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center in Concord, New Hampshire, is named after Shepard and Christa McAuliffe. Interstate 93 in New Hampshire, from the Massachusetts outskirt to Hooksett, is assigned the Alan B. Shepard Highway, and in Hampton, Virginia, a street is named Commander Shepard Boulevard in his respect. The place where he grew up of Derry has the epithet Space Town out of appreciation for his profession as a space traveler. Following a demonstration of Congress, the mail station in Derry was assigned the Alan B. Shepard Jr. Mail station Building. Alan Shepard Park in Cocoa Beach, Florida, a shoreline side park south of Cape Canaveral, is named in his respect. The City of Virginia Beach renamed its conference hall, with its basic geodesic vault, the "Alan B. Shepard Convention Center". The structure was later renamed the "Alan B. Shepard Civic Center", and was demolished in 1994. At the season of the "Opportunity 7" dispatch, Shepard lived in Virginia Beach.
