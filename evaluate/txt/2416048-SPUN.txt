She at first rejected the idea to play Eve Russell, however she was more than once reached by NBC about the job more than a while before her operator persuaded her to try out for "Interests"' throwing chief Jackie Briskey.

Ross depicted "Interests" as the inverse of "Ryan's Hope"; "Interests", she felt, was "the spring of a cleanser musical drama" due to the cast and team's fervor about future storylines, while "Ryan's Hope" was "the winter of one" because of the dread of retraction. 

Sheraton Kalouria, senior VP of NBC's daytime programming, said that the show's racially differing troupe, as spoken to by the African American Russells and the Hispanic Lopez-Fitzgeralds, exemplified "genuinely partially blind narrating". Ross trusted that Eve was not characterized by way of life as an African American: "In the event that they needed to make my character some other ethnicity they wouldn't need to change a thing about her... She's only an individual." The performing artist refered to the show's racial assorted variety as an essential explanation behind her appreciation for the job. She expressed that she felt "huge help from NBC and "Interests" that the dark characters and additionally Hispanic characters are largely fundamental pieces of the story".

The cleanser musical show's authentic site expressed that Eve was the "delightful and empathetic town specialist" who was getting a charge out of an effective profession; she was depicted as an altruist by John Berlau of The Atlas Society. Ross at first observed the character as simple to play, calling her "everybody's closest companion, and the town specialist, and an extraordinary mother". The performer had an increasingly troublesome time when Eve started carrying on in ethically sketchy approaches to ensure mysteries about her past. She felt that the adjustment in Eve's character made the job testing on a passionate dimension, contrasting the involvement with "getting a correctional facility sentence and you're relied upon to oblige it with no clarification" or "the divine beings upsetting someone with no reason yet to disturb them". At the point when requested to depict Eve in three words, Ross reacted that she was an "inconsistency inside a puzzle". Playing Eve, she stated, was "as though someone came and disclosed to you that your dearest companion is doing evil things". Ross valued Eve's portrayal as a person who was not depicted as totally fortunate or unfortunate and had honorable characteristics just as shortcomings. She later associated Eve's disgrace of her previous existence with Julian and failure to reveal to her family to Lavinia Kingsley's disappointments about her childhood in the 2002 parody film "The Banger Sisters". 

In a meeting with The Atlas Society, Ross related that her way to deal with Eve was roused by Ayn Rand's objectivist logic. She said that Eve was "continually ready to make penances, and there's dependably someone willing, as Ayn Rand stated, to take any penances you may be happy to make." She contrasted Eve with Catherine Halsey in Rand's 1943 novel, "The Fountainhead", especially around the center of the novel, before Catherine "was totally pulverized". Ross portrayed Eve as "a benevolent creature", and accentuated that her character was particular from her very own self-distinguishing proof as an independent.

The performer explored books on sociopaths and mental cases to help her methodology Eve's longing to shroud her past at any expense. Amid the shooting procedure, she kept a journal to enable her better to see how to approach future scenes. Ross additionally utilized the 2001 novel "Concealed Passions: Secrets from the Diaries of Tabitha Lenox" to advise her translation of Eve's past. She communicated shock that Eve's association with Julian was "a genuine short romance" that diverted the character from "the guiltless young lady to the lady on the Studio 54 move floor engaging in sexual relations". In the wake of modifying her view of Eve's past, Ross played the character's plunge into medications and prostitution as "progressively quick, wild[,] and indiscreet" and "exceptionally untamed and over the top".

Ross portrayed Eve's association with Julian Crane as a legitimate portrayal of an interracial couple. She felt Eve was composed as a completely acknowledged individual with her very own story, as opposed to as a "mobile, living philosophical proclamation" about race relations. Ross adulated "the general population who laid the basis for [her]" and enabled characters to be played other than "in a minstrel-like manner", like Ellen DeGeneres making ready for "Will and Grace". Ross and Amelia Marshall, who played Eve's receptive sister Liz Sanbourne, trusted that the relationship underlined a distinction in social classes instead of races. At first, Ross felt scared by having an impact of a supercouple, saying "[i]t implies such a great amount to me that I need to do it equity", yet following the show's cancelation, she recognized it as her most loved storyline. She proceeded to liken the Julian and Eve's romantic tale to that of Romeo and Juliet. "My Baby's Gone", a melody that Eve every now and again performs on the show amid flashbacks, was utilized to symbolize Eve's association with Julian. Ross recorded the vocals for it, just as four different tunes, without the guide of Auto-Tune. "Interests" was Ross' first singing job. At the point when gotten some information about her encounters singing on the show, Ross said she worked with a vocal mentor, and depicted her sound as "earnest, delicate, [and] non-grinding".
