Gardner constrained a medicinal understudy named Mike Lynch to take him from the premises on a cruiser while pointing a firearm into his back. On August 11, a letter bearer discovered Leavitt's gun in a post box with a note from Gardner that stated, "Here's the firearm and wallet taken from the gatekeeper at the emergency clinic.

Amid the evening of October 9, 1984, Gardner burglarized the Cheers Tavern in Salt Lake City. While affected by cocaine, he shot barkeep Melvyn John Otterstrom in the face, executing him. Otterstrom's cousin Craig Watson expressed that the burglary "increased under $100." Family individuals said Gardner went to Otterstrom's memorial service and claimed to be a beloved companion. Following a tip, police captured Gardner three weeks after the fact at the home of his cousin. Gardner said that the shooting happened on the grounds that Otterstrom set up a battle, however examiners did not discover any proof to help this case. Gardner was held in care in lieu of $1.5Â million safeguard. His escape driver was recognized as Darcy Perry McCoy, who affirmed against him. 

Amid preliminary procedures for the Otterstrom murder on April 2, 1985, Gardner endeavored to escape from guardianship with a pistol snuck into the Metropolitan Hall of Justice at Salt Lake City. Jim Kleine of the Salt Lake City Fire Department trusted that the weapon was passed to Gardner as he was being escorted into the town hall from the underground parking garage. Gardner was promptly shot in the chest by watchman Luther Hensley. Gardner at that point injured unarmed bailiff George "Scratch" Kirk in the mid-region. In the wake of racing to the court files, Gardner faced lawyers Robert Macri and Michael Burdell.

State redresses chief William Vickrey cleared the activities of the jail protects who escorted Gardner, however Salt Lake County Sheriff N.D. "Pete" Hayward said that the watchman who shot Gardner ought to have continued shooting until Gardner was dead. An audit found that the watchmen were restrained from shooting since Gardner had been utilizing a prisoner as a human shield. Sheriff Hayward said the break endeavor "gave off an impression of being all around arranged" and accused the security rupture for the design of the Metropolitan Hall of Justice, which enabled unhindered access to zones where detainees were transported. 

Otterstrom, a hiker and veteran of the nineteenth Special Forces Group of the Utah National Guard, was made due by his significant other Kathy and his five-year-old child, Jason. BurdellÂ  a Vietnam veteran, previous specialist, and individual from the Summum ChurchÂ  was made due by his better half, Donna Nu, who might proceed to advocate against Gardner's execution. 

Gardner was determined to have introverted identity issue. In June 1985, Gardner conceded to the homicide of Otterstrom and got a sentence of life detainment without the likelihood of parole. At a certain point, Gardner took steps to disturb resulting court hearings since he was annoyed with being required to wear a leg support that would bolt on the off chance that he endeavored to escape once more. He was prompted by watchmen that it would be to his advantage to carry on before imminent legal hearers. Region Judge Jay E. Banks trained the jury, on October 22, 1985, that they had the choice of a decision for the lesser offense of murder on the off chance that they observed Gardner to be under mental or passionate pressure when he shot Burdell. The members of the jury thought under three hours and discovered Gardner liable of capital homicide. At last condemned to death, Gardner chose execution by terminating squad over deadly infusion. Officials in Utah wiped out the terminating squad as a technique for execution in 2004, yet convicts who were condemned before that date, for example, Gardner, could in any case select that alternative. Since 1976, just two other individuals have been executed by terminating squad in the United States, both in Utah: Gary Gilmore and John Albert Taylor. As opposed to Taylor, who said he picked the terminating squad to humiliate the express, Gardner's lawyer said that his customer did not have any desire to draw in consideration and essentially liked to bite the dust along these lines. 

Gardner's detainment as Utah's then-most youthful prisoner waiting for capital punishment was not uneventful. A meeting was hung on February 19, 1987, in which Gardner and different prisoners asserted "illegal constrainment" in unsanitary conditions with poor sustenance. 

On October 28, 1987, Gardner broke a glass segment in a jail visiting region and had intercourse with a lady who was meeting him, while different detainees cheered and blockaded the entryways. As indicated by state jail representative Juan Benavidez, however Gardner had "thumped out the lights", an officer who was in the control room "could even now observe what was happening."

In 1993, Utah state delegate Dan Tuttle presented what he called "the Ronnie Lee Gardner bill" in which he recommended that law requirement officers be allowed to shoot prisoners endeavoring to get away, regardless of whether they are "outfitted or not." 

On September 25, 1994, Gardner got alcoholic from expending liquor, which he aged in his own jail cell sink, and wounded detainee Richard "Fats" Thomas with a shiv formed from a couple of shades. Thomas endured nine cut injuries to his face, mouth, arm and chest such were reality compromising, however made a full recuperation. In spite of the fact that Thomas had endure the cutting, Gardner was accused of another capital wrongdoing under a 1974 Utah law saved for jail assaults by first-degree lawful offense prisoners. There was no point of reference in the United States for a capital punishment that was completed for such a wrongdoing. The defendability of the law was tested, with safeguard legal advisors calling it "stale and behind the times," and the charge against Gardner was tossed out by the Utah Supreme Court in light of the fact that the injured individual did not kick the bucket. 

In February 1996, Gardner took steps to sue to compel the province of Utah to execute him by terminating squad. He had told a judge in a 1991 hearing that he was roused by his youngsters to look for deadly infusion, however later altered his opinion as they wound up more seasoned. He said that he favored the terminating squad on account of his "Mormon legacy." Gardner likewise felt that administrators were endeavoring to dispose of the terminating squad, contrary to prevalent feeling in Utah, in light of worry over the state's picture in the up and coming 2002 Winter Olympics. 

In 1998, the old Metropolitan Hall of Justice was abandoned and supplanted by the multimillion-dollar Scott M. Matheson Courthouse. Gardner's dangerous break endeavor in 1985 was accused on the open access and light security of the past structure and incredibly affected the more tightly safety efforts received by Salt Lake City's new town hall. Previous examiner Kent Morgan expressed, "Completely Gardner changed that." On March 3, 2001, the Metropolitan Hall of Justice was wrecked. 

In 2007, U.S. government judge Tena Campbell dismissed Gardner's allure that his lawyers were deficient on the grounds that they were unfit to demonstrate that he didn't intend to slaughter his unfortunate casualty. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected movements for bid by his guard on March 8, 2010. Gardner endeavored to surrender the procedure somewhere around multiple times, however his lawyers persuaded him to keep engaging each time. State court Judge Robin Reese marked an execution warrant on April 23 requesting the state to do capital punishment. 

At Gardner's recompense hearing on June 10, 2010, attorneys and therapeutic specialists with all due respect contended whether meningitis contracted at 4 years old had harmed his cerebrum. Gardner had likewise huffed gas and paste with his kin, and played with mercury stolen from gas meters by his stepfather to sell. Three of the attendants that condemned Gardner to death marked a testimony that they would have suggested existence without any chance to appeal, an alternative that was not accessible in Utah until 1992. Gardner guaranteed that he was a changed man who guided different prisoners and was keen on beginning a natural homestead venture for adolescents on in Box Elder County, Utah. Gardner's lawyer introduced a letter his customer wrote to Oprah Winfrey mentioning assets for the venture. Gardner additionally contended that it was not legitimate to execute him after so much time had gone since the wrongdoing. 

Right hand state lawyer general Tom Brunker contended against leniency, expressing: "Mr. Gardner was condemned to death and earned that capital punishment on account of his unflagging history of fierce wrongdoing." The group of the late George "Scratch" Kirk related how his being shot by Gardner influenced their lives and at last abbreviated Kirk's life. Kirk's little girl Barb Webb stated, "He's completed a ton of horrendous things from quite a while ago and I think, given the opportunity, he would do them all once more." Jason Otterstrom, whose father Melvyn was killed by Gardner, attempted to depict the effect upon his family. In the wake of tuning in to the declaration from the groups of the people in question, the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole declined Gardner's recompense demand, expressing that the jury's decision and sentence were "not unseemly." The board individuals refered to his rough record amid detainment and scrutinized his push to change as being "short of what was needed." Gardner uncovered at the consultation that it was Darcy Perry McCoy who furnished him the weapon with which he killed Michael Burdell. Agent Salt Lake County lawyer Bob Stott said that McCoy would not be arraigned in light of the fact that Gardner, the main observer, would have been executed. 

The Utah Supreme Court maintained lower court decisions on June 14, 2010, depleting Gardner's interests inside the state. The U.S. Preeminent Court turned down conclusive interests on June 17, however a court request demonstrated that disagreeing Justices Stephen Breyer and John Paul Stevens would have allowed a stay of execution. Utah representative Gary Herbert likewise declined to intercede in light of the fact that Gardner had "a full and reasonable chance" in court. State lawyer general Mark Shurtleff reported on Twitter that he approved the execution: "I just gave the thumbs up to Corrections Director to continue with Gardner's execution." 

Adversaries of the death penalty accumulated at the Utah State Capitol to hold a rally amid the last interests. The dissent was gone to by Gardner's family, and was sorted out by Utahans for Alternatives to the Death Penalty. The challenge likewise incorporated the help of Brian King of the Utah House of Representatives, who swore to encourage the lawmaking body to reevaluate the utilization of the death penalty. The group of homicide injured individual Michael Burdell had additionally claimed for Gardner's benefit, expressing that Burdell was a radical who might have restricted capital punishment. 

News media landed from around the globe and raised the issue of blood amends in light of Gardner's reference of his Mormon roots in choosing the terminating squad. A few devotees of Mormonism were trained that murder is heinous to the point that the blood of the guilty party must be spilled to pay for their transgressions. On the day preceding Gardner's execution, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints discharged the accompanying articulation: 

In the mid-nineteenth century, when explanatory, enthusiastic speech was normal, some congregation individuals and pioneers utilized coarse speech that included thoughts of individuals making compensation for their wrongdoings by surrendering their own lives. 

Be that as it may, purported "blood expiation," by which people would be required to shed their very own blood to pay for their transgressions, isn't a regulation of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We have confidence in and show the boundless and comprehensive expiation of Jesus Christ, which makes pardoning of wrongdoing and salvation feasible for all individuals. 

Different categories voiced their resistance to the utilization of the death penalty. Reverend David Henry of the First Baptist Church of Salt Lake City stated, "Brutality breeds savagery ... . It doesn't work. It's inadequate, and it's brutalizing we all." Cardinal Keith O'Brien of the Roman Catholic Church later utilized Gardner's cases to depict the "way of life of retaliation" in the United States. 

As indicated by surveys, support for the death penalty had been relentlessly declining since the 1990s, yet most of individuals in Utah still bolstered capital punishment in the period paving the way to Gardner's booked execution. In 2010, Kay McIff of the Utah House of Representatives supported enactment to require sentenced prisoners to bring all intrigue contentions up in their first post-conviction request, taking note of that Gardner's various interests kept his case waiting for capital punishment for about 25Â years. The bill, HB202, passed the Utah House by an edge of 67-to-5 on February 1, 2011, and collectively passed the Utah State Senate on February 17. The enactment was marked into law by the Governor on 22 March 2011. The law precludes any stay from securing execution after a first intrigue, without a legal audit of new proof (or a pregnant litigant), that a judge decides would have tangibly influenced the first case. 

The Utah Department of Corrections gave Gardner's lawyer, Andrew Parnes, with documentation about executions by terminating squad and deadly infusion. The records incorporated the Utah execution group's preparation and aptitude. Parnes handed-off the data to Gardner subsequent to making a deal to avoid uncovering it to any other individual. 

On June 15, 2010, Gardner ate a last dinner of steak, lobster tail, crusty fruit-filled treat, vanilla dessert and 7-Up, before starting a 48-hour quick while watching "The Lord of the Rings" film set of three and perusing "Divine Justice". As per his legal advisors, the quick was inspired by "profound reasons." Gardner was visited by a LDS religious administrator and his family before his execution. Gardner strolled deliberately to his place of execution. Whenever inquired as to whether he had any final words, he reacted, "I don't, no." 

Gardner was executed on June 18, 2010, at 12:15Â am Mountain Daylight Time by a terminating squad at Utah State Prison in Draper. He was set handcuffed on a dark metal seat with a hood covering his head. Sandbags were organized around him to retain ricochets. The terminating squad was comprised of five unknown volunteers who were confirmed cops. The officers remained about from Gardner, going for a white target situated over his heart. One of their .30-gauge Winchester rifles was chosen indiscriminately and stacked with a non-deadly wax slug so they would not know with assurance who discharged the lethal shots. As per the Utah Department of Corrections, the squad utilized a commencement rhythm starting with five and at the same time terminating directly before two. His dim blue jumpsuit made it hard to see the blood from his injuries. A therapeutic inspector evacuated Gardner's hood to uncover his dormant face. Subsequent to confirming Gardner's absence of heartbeat at the neck and pupillary light reflex, the therapeutic analyst articulated him dead at 12:17Â am. He was the primary individual to be executed by terminating squad in the United States since the execution of John Albert Taylor 14 years sooner.
