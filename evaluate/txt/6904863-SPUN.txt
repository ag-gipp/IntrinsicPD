Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar 

The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar was a fifty-penny piece struck discontinuously by the United States Bureau of the Mint somewhere in the range of 1926 and 1939. The coin was structured by Laura Gardin Fraser and James Earle Fraser, and honors the individuals who ventured to every part of the Oregon Trail and settled the Pacific Coast of the United States in the mid-nineteenth century. Struck over a long period in little numbers every year, the numerous assortments created came to be considered a sham by mint piece gatherers, and prompted the end, for the time, of the memorial coin arrangement. 

Ohio-conceived Ezra Meeker had ventured to every part of the Trail with his family in 1852 and went through the last two many years of his long life before his passing in 1928 publicizing the Oregon Trail, that it ought not be overlooked. In 1926, at age 95, he showed up before a Senate panel, mentioning that the officially sanctioned a dedicatory coin that could be sold to fund-raise for markers to indicate where the Trail had been. The coin had initially been idea of by Idahoans, driven by Dr. Minnie Howard, looking to facilitate conservation work at Fort Hall; Meeker widened the thought. Congress approved six million half dollars, and set no confinement on when or at what mint the coins would be struck. Meeker's Oregon Trail Memorial Association (OTMA) had a huge number of pieces struck in 1926 and 1928, and did not offer them all. By and by, most years somewhere in the range of 1933 and 1939, it had little amounts of the half dollar instituted, in certain years from each of the three working mints to deliver mintmarked assortments, and raised costs impressively. 

Gatherers griped that a portion of the issues were constrained by currency vendors, and individual authorities needed to pay high costs. Open challenges pursued, and in 1939 Congress finished the arrangement. In spite of the protests, the OTMA experienced issues in selling the coins, and they stayed accessible from the OTMA's successor association as late as 1953. A little more than 260,000 of the 6,000,000 approved coins were struck, of which around 60,000 were dissolved. The US dedicatory coin struck over the longest period, the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar has been generally lauded for its plan. 

In the center long stretches of the nineteenth century, before the finish of the cross-country railroad in 1869 made travel simpler, a huge number of individuals ventured along the Oregon Trail to settle the Far West of the United States. Not all who started the voyage achieved their goal as there was much misery and passing en routeâby one gauge, 20,000 individuals lie in plain graves. 

Ohio-conceived rancher Ezra Meeker (1830â 1928) ventured to every part of the Oregon Trail in 1852; he and his young spouse and newborn child tyke passed by bull attracted wagon from Iowa to Oregon Territory. In his maturity, he came to trust that the Oregon Trail, and the penance of the individuals who had passed on along it, were being overlooked. In the midst of impressive attention as one of the last overcomers of the pioneers who had blasted the way west, Meeker backtracked his course along the Trail somewhere in the range of 1906 and 1908. The Trail had in certain spots vanished, gobbled up by town and ranch, and in his adventures, he looked to discover where he had passed, trying to have verifiable markers raised. He took his bull group and wagon the country over to promote his motivation, stopping his apparatus before the White House where he met President Theodore Roosevelt. In New York, he crossed the Brooklyn Bridge. In 1910, he and his bulls took an interest in the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena. In the succeeding years, he ventured to every part of the course by oxcart, vehicle, and, at age 93 of every 1924, plane, endeavoring to facilitate his motivation, and looking for government acknowledgment and subsidizing for his endeavors. 

The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar originated from different endeavors by Idahoans who supported the safeguarding of the site of Fort Hall, a vital route station on the Trail. The thought was started by the issuance of the 1925 Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar, which caused Mabel Murphy, spouse of an Idaho newspaperman, to propose to her significant other the striking of an Oregon Trail coin, the benefits from which could be utilized for notable conservation. Her significant other, D.T. Murphy, on April 16, 1925 obediently distributed an article, "Oregon Trail Covered Wagon Half Dollars" in the "Idaho State Journal". Mrs. Murphy would not live to see the coin issued, biting the dust November 30, 1925 of tuberculosis. 

The thought for the coin was raised again when community activists in Pocatello, Idaho, driven by Dr. Minnie Howard, looked for thoughts for subsidizing a landmark on the site of Fort Hall. Protection sales rep F.C. McGowan showed a Stone Mountain piece, "Yes. Coinage. Like this!" Howard and her partners sought after the thought. Meeker did too once he knew about it, framing the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, ("OTMA" or "the Association") a national association, which could likewise get the half dollars, and offer them at a benefit. 

By 1925, Congress was hesitant to approve progressively dedicatory coins; twelve pieces had been issued somewhere in the range of 1920 and 1925, and numerous lawmakers felt that coins were being permitted that "commemorate[d] occasions of neighborhood and not national intrigue". The whole mintages of commemoratives were sold without needing any proof to the supporting associations assigned in the approving demonstrations. These gatherings at that point sold the coins to the general population at a higher cost than expected, subsequently fund-raising for causes that Congress had esteemed commendable. Made wary by a progression of ineffective issues, Congress dismissed various proposition for uncommon coins in mid 1926. Among these were pieces to respect the finishing of the Lincoln and Victory Highways, and a proposition to honor the centennial of the introduction of American author Stephen Foster. 

The bill approving the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar was first presented in the House of Representatives on January 25, 1926 by Washington Congressman John Franklin Miller, who had recently been civic chairman of Seattle. Meeker was living in Seattle while Miller was city hall leader, having moved from his past home in Puyallup. As per neighborhood antiquarian Bert Webber in his 1986 monograph on the coin, "there is little uncertainty that Mr. Mill operator was impacted to propose this coin by Ezra Meeker." A conference was held before the House Coinage Committee on March 3; Meeker affirmed. The bill was accounted for positively, and afterward gone by the full House on April 5, 1926. The bill was not restricted in the House of Representatives, however one part, Michigan Congressman Louis Cramton, made a few inquiries before it gone by consistent assent. As indicated by an October 2013 article in "The Numismatist", "Congress was no counterpart for Meeker". 

On April 26, 1926, the 95-year-old Meeker showed up before the Senate's Committee on Banking and Currency. Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon had documented a letter restricting memorial coin issues, aside from those of national significance. Meeker, in his declaration, contended that the Trail issue would be of such significance. The OTMA board thought about whether to look for revision of the bill to the option recommended by Mellon, a memorial decoration. To some degree due to Howard's encouraging, they chose to remain with the coin. The bill for the half dollar was accounted for without suggestion, however was passed by the Senate on May 10. Meeker met with President Calvin Coolidge to guarantee it would be marked, which it was on May 17, 1926 as Public Law 325, approving the issuance of up to 6,000,000 half dollars. President Calvin Coolidge marked the bill on the White House grass; Meeker was available at the marking service and was captured shaking hands with President Coolidge. 

The bill necessitated that the Association pay for the half dollars at standard, and that the kicks the bucket and different expenses of readiness not be to the detriment of the United States. The figure of six million was the biggest in American dedicatory history, surpassing the five million for the Stone Mountain issue. Congress put no confinement on which mint should strike the coins, and did not put a period limit on the approval. As per numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen in their reference book of US commemoratives, the bill passed "conceivably on the grounds that the expressed reason for existing was nationalistic as opposed to indistinctly nearby". Coin seller and creator Q. David Bowers expresses that "superficially the inspiration appeared to be great enoughÂ ... surely numerous American natives had family connections to the acclaimed movement". 

Meeker needed the new half dollars struck as fast as would be prudent; he was arranging another voyage west on the Trail, and needed to have the capacity to sell the coins en route. The Association at first reached Chester Beach, credited with the structure of the 1923 Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar, to shape the new coin, yet he was inaccessible, however he arranged portrayals. 

The OTMA endeavored to achieve concurrence with Gutzon Borglum, originator of the Stone Mountain piece, yet he needed an excess of cash and time. Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar, who had assumed a minor job in the Columbian half dollar of 1892â 93, was eager, yet did not have the national notoriety the Association felt the coin's artist required. In the wake of getting recommendations from the American Numismatic Society, the Association swung to the couple group of James Earle Fraser and Laura Gardin Fraser. James Fraser had planned the Buffalo nickel; Laura Gardin Fraser had made a few dedicatory coins, including the Grant Centennial dollar and half dollar. It picked the Frasers at the encouraging of Minnie Howard, who felt that James Fraser's work managed the West, and might make show, in his coin plan, the significance of the movement by secured wagon. The Association decided upon a structure idea of a guide demonstrating the Oregon Trail on one side, and on the other a man driving a bull drawn wagon, with his significant other and newborn child tyke riding. In spite of the fact that he isn't formally celebrated by the coin, the man was intended to be Meeker. 

James Fraser planned the "wagon" "side" while Laura Fraser structured the "Indian side" and changed over both into alleviation models. Meeker hassled Laura Fraser to finish the demonstrating, as he needed the half dollars accessible available to be purchased at an up and coming occasion. She finished the work by July 30, 1926, when she wrote to enquire where she ought to send the structures for support by the Commission of Fine Arts. This body since 1921 had been entrusted with educating the Secretary regarding the Treasury on coinage structure. She sent photos of her models to the commission's workplaces. On August 5, 1926, commission executive Charles Moore reacted excitedly, educating her that had the commission supported the structures, however they were having the prints encircled for their gathering room. To spare time, the centers from which coinage bites the dust could be readied were made by the Medallic Art Company of New York, which had made decreases from mortar models to center points for a few dedicatory issues. The subsequent center points were sent to the Philadelphia Mint, where working bites the dust for the issue were made. A compass ascended on the Indian side, incorporated into Laura Fraser's models, does not show up on the issued coin, however the purpose behind the change isn't known. 

The "wagon side" planned by James Fraser portrays a Conestoga wagon drawn by two bulls, heading into a very vast setting sun, with radiant beams. The fashioners' initials show up behind the wagon; five stars show up beneath the vehicle, however what they speak to is dubious. Swiatek and Breen recommended that they speak to five states and regions through which pioneers would have passed. 

The "Indian side" structured by Laura Fraser highlights a significantly rendered Native American, standing erect with outstretched arm in what Vermeule portrays as a motion of harmony. The Indian was added by the Frasers to the first guide structure idea supported by the OTMA. Swiatek and Breen noticed that the Indian's "position has been disrespectfully contrasted with that of a traffic policeman requesting 'Halt!'Â " Such proclamations were produced using the season of issue; "The Numismatist" in November 1926 expressed that the Indian's left hand "is upraised as though cautioning the general population of the East of the hazards and hardship of the Trail". Meeker's 1928 eulogy in "The New York Times" affirmed that the Indian was "remaining with hands upraised to stop the white man's advancement westbound". The Native American wears a crown, has a cover and bow, and is superimposed on a guide of the United States, with a line of Conestoga wagons traveling west. The structure is conveyed to the edge of the coin; Hudson Bay is unmistakable in the upper right. 

The Frasers' plan for the half dollar has been generally appreciated. Swiatek and Breen considered the issue "one of the best creative triumphs ever to be discharged by the Mint". Numismatic history specialist Don Taxay called the coin "the most wonderful just as the most genuinely 'American' U.S. coin. It vouches for the way that legitimate virtuoso, notwithstanding when hampered by the necessities of a cutting edge, mechanical mint, can change our coinage into a gem." 

As indicated by Webber, "amid the last phases of production, [Meeker] continued pestering the mint to 'rush up'Â ". The Philadelphia Mint struck 48,000 pieces in September 1926, in addition to 30 held for assessment by the 1927 United States Assay Commission. Meeker hawked them along his course at $1 each. The contrast between the assumed worth and the deal cost was to pay the expense for verifiable markers along the Trail, and to remodel the Whitman Mission in Washington state. The 1926 piece was later named by the Association the "Ezra Meeker Issue". The main piece struck was displayed to Meeker; its whereabouts are not known, while the second, exhibited to Howard, rests in the Idaho State Historical Museum. 

With the underlying amount submitted (75 pieces were come back to the mint, undoubtedly in light of the fact that they were harmed or misstruck), the Association mentioned that more pieces be created. A hundred thousand were instituted at the San Francisco Mint in October and November, bearing the mint imprint S (1926-S). The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar in this way turned into the principal dedicatory coin struck at various mints; Bowers takes note of that this set "a point of reference which would be extended and mishandled in the years to come". As per Swiatek and Breen, "the AssociationÂ ... [was] expecting that the gatherers who purchased 1926 Philadelphia coins would turn out in comparative or more noteworthy numbers for the second assortment". In spite of the fact that a couple of thousand rapidly sold, the market for the half dollars demonstrated immersed, and several thousands stayed at the mint pending installment. On December 29, 1926, Meeker commended his 96th birthday celebration in New York; he was given 96 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars by the Association. 

Regardless of the numerous unsold 1926-S half dollars still in the administration's hands, the Association looked for the issuance of 1927-dated half dollars; this was denied by the Treasury Department (of which the Bureau of the Mint was a section) because of the build-up. In 1928, 50,000 more were struck at the Philadelphia Mint. Meeker proceeded with his adventures: he was given 97 coins on his birthday in December 1927 by the Association and conveyed his half dollars to the guest's display of the New York Stock Exchange, however he was denied authorization to go onto the floor. In April 1928, Meeker kept in touch with the American Numismatic Association, asking its currency gathering individuals to buy both the 1926 and 1926-S pieces. By the by, albeit Meeker sorted out a national crusade to sell the coins, the OTMA lost $10,000 by his endeavors, because of office and different costs. "The matured pioneer did not seem, by all accounts, to be that great with cash". 

Meeker was given a truck suspension and cash to change it into a wagon-topped vehicle by Henry Ford in 1928 for one more Trail trip. Portage offered to make the vehicle increasingly agreeable for Meeker on the off chance that he got it to the Ford industrial facility Dearborn, Michigan. As needs be, the point at which he left New York in August 1928 on another adventure, wanting to sell half dollars en route, he set out straightforwardly toward Michigan. He arrived sick, and was hospitalized, practically kicking the bucket there. He had the capacity to return home, disappointed at having missed casting a ballot in the race (he bolstered the fruitful Republican competitor, Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, for president) out of the blue since 1853. At his home in Washington state, Meeker again turned out to be sick in November, and kicked the bucket December 3, 1928, three and a half weeks before his 98th birthday celebration. He was covered in a graveyard in Puyallup, a spot he had helped settle. Meeker's tombstone bears a plaque recreating the wagon side of the half dollar. 

After Meeker's passing, the OTMA chose Howard R. Driggs, a teacher of English instruction at New York University as his successor, and chose another governing body, which attempted to clear the obligation Meeker had collected. Coins close by kept on being sold. It had the capacity to induce President Hoover to announce the Covered Wagon Centennial in 1930, the hundredth commemoration both of Meeker's introduction to the world and of the main wagon train leaving St. Louis for the Oregon nation. One methods for selling coins the Association formulated was a grounds wide drive at Yale University, institute of matriculation of Association official executive Lorne W. Buckley, in October 1930 to fund-raise for Trail markers. In excess of 600 coins were sold. 

Most 1928 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars stayed in the hands of the Treasury for quite a long while after their striking, however the Association bought an expected 1,000 available to be purchased to general society. This impoundment by the legislature created enthusiasm for the mint piece gathering networkâa few letters to the editorial manager showed up in "The Numismatist", enquiring with regards to the coins' destiny. One authority caught up with the Philadelphia Mint; Acting Superintendent Fred H. Chaffin answered that the coins were being held there for the Association, and were dated 1928. The OTMA had a money related emergency in 1931, and was wanting to close its entryways, however tasks proceeded, with home office moved from its Manhattan office to Driggs' home in Bayside, Queens. The Association advertised the 1928 coins as the "Jedediah Smith Issue". 

In mid 1933, Driggs looked for the issuance of all the more half dollars for the benefit of the OTMA, keeping in touch with the acting Mint Director, Mary Margaret O'Reilly. and after that to Treasury Secretary William H. Woodin. Driggs needed 5,000 of the 1928 and 5,000 new half dollars struck at Denver (1933-D), proposing to trade 10,000 half dollars dated 1926. Every one of the coins held by the administration, including those obtained by the trade, were to be liquefied. This was endorsed, and the pieces were properly struck at the Denver Mint, the principal dedicatory coins at any point struck at Denver. 

The Association had swung to the Scott Stamp and Coin Company of New York to advertise the coins. Scott had the capacity to offer a portion of the 1928 half dollars. These activities have been translated adversely by numismatic researchers: Q. David Bowers affirms that Scott's delegate, Wayte Raymond, proposed softening the majority of the issue to make a counterfeit shortage, and that the organization "wanted to benefit from the guilelessness of gatherers and their need to finish sets by having more assortments instituted. Scott assumed that if extra Oregon Trail half dollars could be stamped with the date 1933 they could be sold viably at the Century of Progress Exposition held that year in Chicago." Swiatek and Breen noted, "through God just comprehends what way of political control, the Oregon Trail Memorial Association figured out how to get endorsement of another 1933 Denver issue" available to be purchased at the piece. 

A sum of 5,250 of the 1933-D were struck, of which roughly five were held for the Assay Commission and 242 were inevitably returned for softening. Nooks trusts that the returned pieces were likely inadequate, as opposed to unsold. The Association named the 1933-D the "Era of Progress Exposition Issue"; both the 1928 and the 1933-D half dollars were sold for $2 each. Be that as it may, the 1928 could be gotten for $1.75 by any individual who had as of late purchased at least two of the 1926 issues, and could be obtained for as meager as $1.10 each by acquiring 10 of the 1926-dated coins. 

With the general achievement of the 1933-D issue, the Association requested 7,000 more in 1934, additionally struck at Denver. These were named the "Post Hall, Fort Laramie and Jason Lee Issue" and were additionally sold by Scott, for $2. These additionally were not paid for by the OTMA, however were a trade for 1926-S half dollarsâthe appropriation figure of 83,055 for the 1926-S levels with 100,000 for the OTMA in addition to 55 examine pieces short 17,000 returned in return for the 1933-D and 1934-D pieces. 

The restored Oregon Trail issue wound up disputable in the gathering network, with countless clubs passing goals against the reissues; the leader of the American Numismatic Association called for memorial coins to be sold just by the Mint, not by private associations. Driggs challenged the goals, duplicates of which were sent to government experts. All things considered, the 1935-S pieces he had mentioned of the Mint, and bites the dust for which were readied, were never struck, maybe due to the resentment of gatherers. Different reasons have been hypothesized for the absence of an issue in 1935: in a 1937 monograph cited by Bowers, early coin vendor B. Max Mehl guessed that it took Scott two years to discard the 1934-D pieces. 

Starting in 1934, associations and people saw little mintage commemoratives, struck at different mints through the span of years, as an open door for benefit. Congress approved a few issues in 1934, including the Texas Centennial half dollar, intended to respect the centennial of Texas Independence in 1936, yet struck from 1934 to 1938, after 1934 at all three mints every year. All the more new commemoratives followed in 1935, and more than 20 out of 1936. These issues incorporated the Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar, issued to remember the 50th commemoration of Cincinnati as a focal point of music, albeit nothing strange is known to have occurred in that city's melodic life in 1886. 

Numismatist Arlie R. Slabaugh, in his volume on US dedicatory coins, examined the promoting practices of the 1930s: 

On December 30, 1935, Driggs wrote to O'Reilly, who with the arrangement of Nellie Tayloe Ross as Mint Director had continued her situation as Assistant Mint Director, looking for the issuance of 5,000 Oregon Trail coins to be struck at San Francisco (1936-S) to praise the centennial of the entry of evangelist Marcus Whitman and his significant other in the Walla Valley. O'Reilly and different authorities did not promptly reply and Driggs composed again in March 1936, Chaffin, again acting director at Philadelphia, reacted that the kicks the bucket had been arranged and sent to San Francisco. The coins were sent at Driggs' solicitation to Scott's in New York. In May, Driggs asked that 10,000 more be struck at Philadelphia, and this was finished. These were sold at the tallness of the memorial coin blast. A portion of the 1936 and 1936-S pieces were sold by Scott, others by the Association through a New York City mail drop, in either case at an underlying cost of $1.60 per half dollar. Six each of the 1936 and 1936-S were struck notwithstanding the mentioned amounts, for test. 

In June 1936, Herbert G. West, leader of the Whitman Centennial Celebration, wrote to Driggs illuminating him that his gathering had looked for and neglected to pick up (strangely for 1936) a memorial half dollar to back its exercises. West needed Driggs to arrange an exceptional issue of the Oregon Trail dedicatory for the Whitman association to sell. Driggs was hesitant, first revealing to West that he trusted they may at present be effective in picking up their very own half dollar, and after that that a unique issue would be hard to get as the mints had closed down for the late spring. He in the long run consented to give the Whitman assemble a thousand 1936-S half dollars, on condition they not be sold for under $1.60 so as not to undermine the OTMA's business endeavors. Truth be told, Driggs proposed a deal cost of $2, which was what the Whitman association sold them for. These were named the "Whitman Centennial Issue", or the "Whitman Mission Issue". The greater part of the 1936 pieces struck at Philadelphia were sold by the methods for a mailing to Scott's client list. Some bit of every one of the issues somewhere in the range of 1933 and 1937 were held available to be purchased by enthusiastic associations. 

The 1937 issue was appropriated just by the Association as the arrangement with Scott had been finished. An aggregate of 12,000 pieces (in addition to eight for the Assay Commission) were struck at Denver, and were sold at $1.60. No uncommon name was given to the issue. Coin seller Mehl pondered in 1937, "the 1936 Philadelphia Mint coin is currently retailing at $5 and the San Francisco Mint at $10. Where will this thing stop? I don't have the foggiest idea." 

The 1938 coins, again without an exceptional name, were struck at all three mints, the first occasion when that had been accomplished for the Oregon Trail coins in a single year. Six thousand (or more pieces for the Assay Commission) were struck at each mint, and the issue was sold in sets of three, for $6.25. A similar practice was followed in 1939, however the cost was raised to $7.50 a set and the mintage diminished to 3,000 coins, in addition to the examine pieces. As per Swiatek and Breen, these sets were additionally purchased up by theorists, and individual gatherers regularly needed to pay twofold or triple the issue cost to verify a set. The coins did not sell out in a flash; the OTMA's bookkeeping records uncover that nine months after the 1938 coins were put marked down, the association still had practically a large portion of the issue accessible. Thus, by October 1939, the Association had sold just 8,283 half dollars dated that year, not exactly the 9,000 accessible available to be purchased. In any case, authorities sent letters of dissent to congressmen and to the Treasury Department. On August 5, 1939, Congress acted, passing enactment that put a conclusion to every memorial issue approved before March 1939. Swiatek and Breen saw that if Congress had not mediated, "there would most likely be Oregon Trail coins dated 1980". 

An aggregate of 264,419 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars were struck, of which around 174 were planned for the Assay Commission, and 61,317 were dissolved. In like manner, an aggregate of 202,928 were issued to general society. The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar was the dedicatory coin struck for the longest period. As indicated by R.S. Yeoman's 2018 luxurious version of "A Guide Book of United States Coins", the least expensive Oregon Trail coins are the 1926 and 1926-S at $135 in Almost Uncirculated. The 1939 pieces are recorded just as a set and in Mint State condition (uncirculated), starting at $1,350. 

The Oregon Trail Memorial Association turned out to be a piece of the recently shaped American Pioneer Trails Association (APTA) in 1940, a gathering intended to be more extensive in degree than the OTMA. A 1942 joint fiscal report of the two associations uncovers that despite everything it held 7,212 half dollars. It was selling 1936 and 1937-D half dollars in 1943. A letter to the editorial manager in the September 1943 issue of "The Numismatist" expressed that the gathering was offering the pieces at $5 to fund stakes made of Oregon wood with which to check the Trail. The entirety of five dollars, which included participation, paid for a coin at any given moment, the letter noted, when the pieces were selling at $1.50 from vendors. 

Minnie Howard was still in 1947 attempting to verify the site of Fort Hall, and as a component of that exertion got Idaho Senator Henry Dworshak to present enactment permitting the issuance of more Oregon Trail half dollars to profit Howard's Idaho association. No sooner had he done as such, on February 26, than President Harry Truman declared his restriction to different coin charges that had been presented. Acting Treasury Secretary E.F. Foley wrote in resistance, following the history between the OTMA and the Treasury Department, "Coins were requested to be stamped and left in the mints". The Banking Committee restricted the bill, and it fizzled. As per a November 2014 article in "The Numismatist", "With the endeavors during the 1940s, the Oregon Trail half dollar, having seen its dawn in Pocatello, met its nightfall there too." 

Driggs drove the APTA until his passing at age 89 out of 1963, however it turned out to be less dynamic in his last years. He held probably some half dollars, informing the Mint in 1953 that the APTA was the successor to the OTMA, and still had half dollars available to be purchased. After his passing, more than fifty Oregon Trail half dollars were found among his belongings. Different gatherings have conveyed the APTA's missions of Trail safeguarding and the structure of landmarks. In 1963, two years before Howard's demise, the City of Pocatello raised an imitation of Fort Hall in a recreation center. The real site, in any case, stays undeveloped, with a subtle marker. 

No dedicatory coins were struck somewhere in the range of 1939 and 1945. At the point when approvals continued after the war, issues out of appreciation for Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver were sold, in certain years, in low-mintage sets of coins from every one of the three mints. After 1954, when the last such pieces were struck, the Treasury Department did not again bolster a non-circling dedicatory until 1982, when a half dollar out of appreciation for the 250th commemoration of the introduction of George Washington was issued. The Washington half dollar was circulated by the Mint, with benefits connected to the decrease of the national obligation. Nooks expresses, "this time around[, striking of dedicatory coins] would not be for the benefit of private or neighborhood interests". 

Before, numismatic journalists have depicted the Association and its exercises cruelly. Thickets expresses that the Oregon Trail coins "are delightful, yet conditions encompassing their issuance come up short". Slabaugh noticed that "Creatively, this is my most loved dedicatory coin. However, from a moral viewpoint, it isn't." Swiatek and Breen composed that the Association's "exercises in misusing currency authorities and the overall population in the long run prompted the disagreeability of commemoratives in Congress and at last to resolved Treasury Department resistance to any further dedicatory issues, regardless of how commendable the reason to be memorialized, regardless of who spoke to the supporting commissions". As per Bowers, "supposedly, the monetary advantages which gave the motivation to issuing the half dollars, 'to save the different vital focuses along the old trail from obscurity,' to erect 'reasonable landmarks, dedication and something else,' and so on., never happened, in any event not from cash given by the clearance of the coins." These, in any case, did not have the advantage of analyzing OTMA records. Following the opening of Driggs' papers for research at Southern Utah University, an October 2013 article in "The Numismatist" reasoned that however numerous reports, for example, the game plans with Scott's, are absent from his records, what there is "appears to be predictable with Driggs needing to utilize the coins to back the stamping of the Oregon Trail, not to line his very own pockets". 

Few coins from every year and mint were set aside for examination by the next year's Assay Commission; the above figures incorporate such pieces. This records for the difference from the even thousand mintages in 1933 and after.
