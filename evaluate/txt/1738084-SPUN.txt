As indicated by Nielsen Media Research, it was seen by about 2.2 million families amid its unique communicate, which at the time was around multiple times Comedy Central's normal viewership. Parker and Stone said they were discontent with the turkey subplot, which they composed simply because they felt committed to incorporate a B story.

Notwithstanding Starvin' Marvin, who turned into a well known minor character, the scene presented customary characters Kyle's dad Gerald Broflovski and Kenny's relatives Stuart, Carol and Kevin McCormick. 

In the wake of seeing a business about starving youngsters in Africa, Cartman, Stan, Kenny and Kyle send cash to Sally Struthers' philanthropy association, the Christian Children's Fund. They couldn't care less about the reason, yet need the free games watch that accompanies the sponsorship. Nonetheless, because of a miscommunication, an Ethiopian kid is conveyed to the young men rather than the watch. Albeit at first stunned, the four young men become friends with him, and Cartman names the kid Starvin' ("Marvin" being given to him by the obvious articulation of his name when he was talking in his local language). In the interim, crowds of wild turkeys start assaulting and murdering South Park inhabitants. Crazy lab rat Dr. Mephisto attempts to caution Mayor McDaniels that hereditarily built turkeys he had been rearing to sustain to the poor have gone insane and are presently assaulting people.

The young men take Marvin to an everything you-can-eat buffet, where he is stunned by how much sustenance the townsfolk expend contrasted with his nation of origin, and by how inefficient Cartman is with his nourishment. Back at school, Mr. Army reports the nourishment drive is a disappointment since understudies have gotten just a couple of jars of creamed corn. The young men present Marvin to the class amid show and tell, after which Mr. Army and Principal Victoria advise the young men they should call Red Cross and send Marvin home. In the mean time, Dr. Mephisto indicates Chef that the turkey DNA is developing so quickly that the turkeys may assume control over the world on the off chance that they are not halted. 

The FBI touches base to take Marvin back to Ethiopia, however Marvin deceives them into taking Cartman.

After a short contention, Cartman uncovered the majority of Struthers' storing of the nourishment supply to the Ethiopians, who at that point assume responsibility for the sustenance supply. 

Back in South Park, Chef encourages the townspeople (in a farce of "Braveheart") to battle the hereditarily designed turkeys; accordingly, one of the turkeys likewise revitalizes the different turkeys to battle the townspeople.

"Starvin' Marvin" was composed by Trey Parker, Matt Stone, and Pam Brady. Coordinated by Parker, it was the main authority "South Park" Thanksgiving scene. Parker and Stone said "Starvin' Marvin", like other occasion scenes, demonstrated hard to make since they felt an obligation to continually top different past occasion appears. Stone gave the voice of Marvin. As indicated by the official "South Park" site, the character was not named after the Starvin' Marvin's image of American service stations, and that the similitude between the two names is only a fortuitous event. Jerry Seinfeld, entertainer and star of the prominent sitcom "Seinfeld", reached Parker and Stone and inquired as to whether he could record a visitor voice act since he was an aficionado of the show. Parker and Stone offered Seinfeld the disposable foundation part of one of the turkeys, however Seinfeld was "a bit put off" by the offer and did not acknowledge. 

The scene was incompletely enlivened by the plugs for the Christian Children's Fund, in which Sally Struthers urges watchers to give cash to give nourishment to starving youngsters in Africa. Parker said he didn't generally trust Struthers was accumulating nourishment from the philanthropy, however he thought of the idea since he thought that it was clever that such a hefty lady would make an open request for sustenance for other people. Parker said he had dependably thought about how a destitute African tyke would respond in the event that they were taken to a substantial smorgasbord supper at an American eatery, with "individuals leaving huge amounts of sustenance on their plates", which filled in as further motivation for the scene. Parker and Stone initially made arrangements for Struthers to bite the dust toward the finish of the scene and have the African youngsters eat her and live off her fat; Comedy Central administrators told the pair they couldn't murder Struthers, in spite of the fact that famous people have been executed off in ensuing scenes with no protests from the system. 

Parker and Stone were discontent with the turkey assault subplot, which they felt "never truly went anyplace" and finished suddenly with no delightful end.

Later in the arrangement, they said they understood this was a bit much and made numerous scenes without a B story. In spite of the fact that the pair loved the "result" of the Starvin' Marvin primary plot, they didn't have a clue how to end the turkey subplot, so they basically had the characters murder all the turkeys and guarantee that there were none left; they chose this abrupt closure was the most entertaining conceivable choice. Stone said of the subplot, "The turkeys were only a reason to have the "Braveheart" arrangement." The artists delighted in making the turkey fight scene, which was intended to be appeared in widescreen angle proportion while the remainder of the scene was energized typically. Be that as it may, the liveliness turned out to be exceptionally troublesome and set aside a long effort to do in light of the fact that it included a bigger number of characters and creatures in a single scene than had at any point been highlighted already in the show. A portion of the characters in the far foundation were energized in a dark and shadowyy style, which Parker said was less an enhanced visualization but rather more it was a "lighting impact meaning we would not like to draw every one of these individuals". 

Notwithstanding Starvin' Marvin himself, the scene incorporated the primary appearances of a few normal characters: Kyle's dad Gerald Broflovski, just as Stuart, Carol, and Kevin McCormick, father, mother, and sibling (individually) of Kenny, who were depicted as extraordinarily poor and unhygienic.

"Starvin' Marvin" investigates and ridicules ravenousness in the US, especially through its unflattering depiction of Sally Struthers, who gluts on gave nourishment implied for starving kids. The avarice and inefficiency appeared in the smorgasbord scene, just as Cartman's general eagerness and absence of comprehension in regards to the predicament of starving African youngsters, has been said to exhibit an excess and wantonness commonly connected with Americans. The ruinous frenzy of the turkeys gives a discourse on hereditary designing. Scott Calef, a rationality educator who thinks about pop culture, said the pulverization brought about by the turkeys, regardless of the best of expectations by Dr. Mephisto, are demonstrative of the unusual nature and moral vagueness of the utilization of hereditary building for the improvement of mankind.
