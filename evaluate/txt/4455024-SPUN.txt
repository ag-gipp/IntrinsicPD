third Battalion third Marines was initiated on 1 June 1942 at New River, North Carolina as the fifth Training Battalion, Division Special Troops, first Marine Division, Fleet Marine Force. On 16 June, they were redesignated as the third Battalion, third Marines, Fleet Marine Force. From August to September 1942, third Battalion conveyed with the remainder of the third Marine Regiment to Tutuila, American Samoa and was reassigned to the second Marine Brigade.

From July to August 1943, they redeployed to the island of Guadalcanal to start preparing in anticipation of the intrusion of Bougainville in November. 

On 1 November 1943, the third Battalion arrived at Cape Torokina with the remainder of third Marines, only east of the Koromokina River. While opposition was incredibly light, the unpleasant surf and thick wilderness (which in numerous spots stretched out right to the water) brought about various landing create being lost or harmed hopeless. For the following two weeks, the brigade helped develop a progression of trails that connected the foothold with the propelling units, and made supply a lot simpler. On 16 November the contingent achieved the Numa Trail and started testing for Japanese units On 18 November after a sharp firefight almost a Japanese barrier the brigade recouped a Japanese guide with significant knowledge on Japanese guards. From 19â 21 November third Battalion kept examining for Japanese units, which had been distinguished as components of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, and taking part in sporadic firefights. In the number one spot up to the Battle of Piva Forks, third Battalion had the capacity to catch basic high territory that would give the Marines the preferred standpoint in the up and coming battle. The genuine fight, from 22â 26 November, saw the absolute most horrible close battle experienced in the Pacific War as of that date. third Battalion also experienced numerous losses abnormally precise Japanese mortar and cannons fire. After two days, following 27 days of persistent activity, third Battalion was moved to a moderately peaceful segment on the third Division's flank where it stayed for the rest of the task. 

In December, the third Marine Division was alleviated by the Army's Americal Division and third Battalion left Bougainville for Guadalcanal on Christmas Day, 1943 with the remainder of the division. They deserted 36 of their confidants, including Corporal John Logan Jr. what's more, Captain Robert Turnbull (Lima Company), who were both granted Navy Crosses amid the Battle of Piva Forks. 165 different Marines from third Battalion moved toward becoming setbacks amid the crusade. After Bougainville, third Battalion led various preparing practices on Guadalcanal from January to May 1944 in anticipation of the intrusion of Kavieng in April (which was dropped) and the Marianas in June. While third Marines was assigned as the gliding save for the underlying intrusion of Saipan, they were at last not landed and came back to Eniwetok for a three-week remain before the attack of Guam. Amid the interval, the Marines of third Battalion were basically limited to their vehicle deliver, the "USS Warren". 

On 21 July 1944, around 0830, third Battalion hit the Asan shorelines on Guam. Arriving on the outrageous left of the whole third Marine Division, their central goal was to take Chonito Cliff and Adelup Point, which denoted the left flank of the division. Inside minutes the Japanese safeguards opened up with mortars and assault rifles, hitting numerous third Battalion Marines coming shorewards. By 0912 force administrator Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Houser announced numerous losses brought about by the two mortars and expert sharpshooter fire. Both Kilo and India Companies hurried the Chonito Cliffs yet the Japanese protectors (Elements of the 2d Battalion, eighteenth Regiment and 320th Independent Infantry Battalion) opposed firmly, now and again moving explosives down the slope. Upheld by flamethrowers, half-tracks, and protection from the third Tank Battalion, third Battalion battled a ridiculous, three-hour fight up the side of Chonito Cliff. Houser then arranged Lima Company to flank the precipices toward the north by dashing down an uncovered shoreline street. Having verified Chonito Cliff, the legion at that point proceeded onward to Adelup Point. The US Navy sent a destroyer to shoot the Japanese caverns at point-clear range and third Battalion flamethrowers wore out Japanese warriors who still remained. In the wake of verifying Adelup Point, third Battalion completed the day giving flank security to the remainder of the third Marines amid the Battle for Bundschu Ridge and turned into the main unit in the regiment to achieve its targets before W-Day's over. 

The principal night of 21â 22 July, the Marines of third Battalion went under a coordinated counterattack by the overcomers of the Japanese 320th Independent Infantry Battalion, just as the 319th, submitted by Japanese leader General Kiyoshi Shigematsu to retake the Chonito Cliffs. The Japanese figured out how to penetrate past numerous third Battalion units through gorges and dry waterway beds and quickly took steps to invade the contingent order post. The battling was heavy to the point that pieces of the Division Reserve were submitted and the destroyer "USS McKee" was unfit to give close fire support, as the Japanese and Marines were so intently blended. Anyway the Marines held firm and figured out how to spurn the assault by 0830. Amid the counterattack, a mortarman with Kilo Company, Private First Class Luther Skaggs, Jr., was fundamentally injured in the leg by a Japanese explosive. Subsequent to applying a tourniquet, Skaggs kept on battling for an additional eight hours before moving unassisted to the back where a large portion of his leg was cut away. For this he turned into the principal Marine from third Battalion to be granted the Medal of Honor. Throughout the following two days the third Battalion battled a savage fight with the Japanese protectors for the Chonito Cliffs and Fonte Plateau region, as the legion attempted to catch the Mt. Tenjo Road. On 23 July, third Battalion caught the last edge prompting the Fonte Plateau, inciting a substantial Japanese counterattack. LtCol Houser himself was genuinely injured in this commitment and the Executive Officer, Major Royal Bastian, took order. At that point third Battalion, presently strengthened with tanks, partook in the attack on the Fonte Plateau on 25 July, catching the key position after only an hour of battling. The evening of 25â 26 July observed the peak of the battling on Guam when the Japanese jump started a hard and fast counterattack against the Americans. In the third Battalion's segment, Japanese mariners of the 54th Keibitai propelled a progression of fizzled assaults against the now-very much shielded Marine positions. Sponsored up with big guns, the Marines effectively shocked the Japanese.

Continuing the hostile at 1545, third Battalion pushed forward 1,500Â yards to catch key street intersections that prompted the towns of Finegayan and Barrigada. For the staying ten days of the crusade, the force walked upper east up the coast, experiencing incidental Japanese obstruction, until the island was proclaimed secure on 10 August. Be that as it may, the Japanese were not completely crushed. On 7 August, as third Battalion drove the regimental development towards Road Junction 460, Japanese mounted guns shells started arriving among the propelling Marines. After Marines found the wellspring of flame, a 75mm gunnery piece, the Japanese fled. The last activity by third Battalion amid the crusade was on 9 August when a close-by regiment went under overwhelming Japanese tank and infantry assault. Pioneering a trail through the wilderness, third Battalion surged towards the activity yet the Japanese tanks evaporated before the brigade could arrive. Setbacks for the third Battalion were twice that of Bougainville, with 300 injured and 97 murdered. 

Following the attack of Guam, third Battalion went through two months directing 'wiping up' activities on the island until November, when it got requests to get ready for tasks against Iwo Jima. From November until February 1945, they partook in a preparation routine so genuine that a kindred legion later announced in any event 20% of its individuals were crippled because of foot and warmth wounds. Amid the Battle of Iwo Jima, third Battalion, as a major aspect of third Marines, was kept seaward as the Expeditionary Troops hold. Be that as it may, notwithstanding various solicitations from other Marine officers, the third Marines were never landed. As indicated by one third Battalion veteran, a few Marines from the legion came shorewards to empty supplies or with different units that they had as of late exchanged to. In the wake of sitting off Iwo Jima in their vehicle ships for a month, the third Marines were requested to profit to Guam for 5 March 1945. 

Back on Guam, third Battalion started preparing for an arrival on Miyako Jima, an island only south of Okinawa. Those requests were in the long run dropped, yet the contingent still observed minor battle in 1945, partaking in two activities on Guam intended to catch Japanese warriors as yet holding out in the slopes. These scopes occurred in April and December 1945. third Battalion likewise started getting ready for Operation Olympic, where as a component of V Amphibious Corps, it would have arrived at Kushikino, Kagoshima on KyÅ«shÅ«. After the dropping of the nuclear bombs in August 1945, and Japan's surrender, third Battalion was separated from the third Marine Division in November 1945 and deactivated the next month on 20 December 1945. Instantly before it was deactivated, in any case, third Battalion endured the questionable respect of having the last American executed in World War II, when PFC W.C.

After four years, in 1962, the regiment sent on the "USS Bayfield" to the Chinese coast to protect the Taiwanese islands of Quemoy Matsu. 

In January 1965, the second Battalion, first Marines at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California conveyed for a visit on Okinawa, Japan, where they were redesignated the third Battalion, third Marines. At the time the Marines of third Battalion expected a run of the mill 13-month sending pursued by a fast come back to the States. Anyway the legion ended up made up for lost time in the underlying sending of Marine units to Vietnam, and arrived on 12 May along the coast south of Danang at Chu Lai. The brigade's first significant activity in the Vietnam War was Operation Starlite where they collaborated with units of the seventh Marines. Activity Starlite was gone for decimating the first Viet Cong (VC) Regiment, which was getting ready to assault Chu Lai from the Van Tuong promontory. The battling started on 18 August when the legion led a land and/or water capable landing only east of the VC positions. At first the assault was hindered by powerful VC postponing strategies. Be that as it may, third Battalion in the end progressed to the edges of the town of A Cuong 2. While endeavoring to clear the town, India Company went under exceptional flame from VC protecting the town. When one squad under Corporal Robert Emmett O'Malley was trapped, O'Malley bounced into a VC channel and by and by slaughtered eight Viet Cong. Injured multiple times, O'Malley would not be emptied until every one of his men were protected and was later granted the Medal of Honor. India Company at that point needed to battle its way back to the remainder of the legion through other Viet Cong units as yet working in the territory. Around 1200, a H&S Company supply caravan destined for India Company was trapped and a power sent to alleviate them was likewise bound. The difficulty was secured by writer Peter Arnett in his article "The Death of Supply Column 21". Amid the evening the circumstance was balanced out and the Viet Cong withdrew that night, bringing about a strategic American triumph. The United States had 52 Marines slaughtered in Starlite. India Company lost 14 dead, including the organization leader, and 53 injured out of a power of 177 Marines.

In October 2011, third Battalion sent again to Helmand Province, this opportunity to the Garmsir District. Situated in southern Helmand, straightforwardly south of Nawa District, Garmsir was both a generally penetration course for Taliban originating from Pakistan, and is considered to have a culture fundamentally the same as Pakistan's.

This organization was especially touchy, coming around a similar time that updates on the Haditha killings (where Marines had killed 24 regular people in a similar zone the past November) broke in the United States. When it touched base in Iraq, third Battalion was given the mission of "battling guerillas, working with local people to improve nearby economy and personal satisfaction, and preparing Iraqi fighters."
