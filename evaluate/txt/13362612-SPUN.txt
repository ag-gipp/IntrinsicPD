An iOS rendition was discharged in September 2017, and a Windows form was discharged in February 2019, both distributed by Annapurna Interactive. The amusement was planned as an "otherworldly successor" to "Stream", a past title by Chen and Thatgamecompany. In "Blossom", the player controls the breeze, blowing a bloom petal through the air utilizing the development of the amusement controller. Flying near blossoms results in the player's petal being trailed by other bloom petals. Moving toward blooms may likewise effectsly affect the diversion world, for example, bringing energetic shading to already dead fields or actuating stationary windmills. The amusement includes no content or discourse, shaping an account circular segment essentially through visual portrayal and passionate prompts. 

"Bloom" was fundamentally planned to excite positive feelings in the player, instead of to be a difficult and "fun" amusement. This center was started by Chen, who felt that the main role of diversion items like computer games was the sentiments that they evoked in the group of onlookers, and that the enthusiastic scope of most recreations was exceptionally restricted. The group saw their endeavors as making a masterpiece, expelling interactivity components and mechanics that were not inciting the ideal reaction in the players. The music, made by Vincent Diamante, powerfully reacts to the player's activities and compares with the enthusiastic signs in the amusement. "Bloom" was a basic achievement, to the amazement of the engineers. Commentators commended the diversion's music, visuals, and ongoing interaction, considering it a one of a kind and convincing enthusiastic experience. It was named the "best autonomous round of 2009" at the Spike Video Game Awards, and won the "Easygoing Game of the Year" grant by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences. 

"Bloom" is separated up into six primary dimensions and one credits level. Each dimension is spoken to by a bloom in a pot on a city condo windowsill, and after choosing one the player is taken to the "fantasy" of that blossom. Once inside a dimension, the player controls the breeze as it blows a solitary blossom petal through the air. Changes in the pitch and move of the drifting petal are cultivated by tilting the PlayStation 3 controller. Squeezing any catch blows the breeze harder, which thus moves the petal quicker. The camera for the most part pursues simply behind the petal, however it once in a while moves to demonstrate another goal or result of the player's activities. 

Gatherings and lines of roses are available in each dimension; drawing closer these with the petal makes them blossom and another petal to trail the first. At the point when the player approaches certain blooms or gatherings of blossoms, changes are made to the amusement world. These incorporate opening new zones, changing dead lush territories to brilliant green fields, or actuating wind turbines. These progressions by and large outcome in new blooms growing for the player to connect with. Flying through each blossom results in a melodic toll that fits with the music. The music itself progressively modifies as changes are made to the world. The more blossom petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the quicker the petals move. It is incomprehensible for the player to lose a dimension or any advancement. The diversion includes no adversaries, hit focuses, or time limits. A solitary play-through of the amusement takes around 60 minutes. 

Albeit no discourse or content is utilized anyplace in the diversion beside credits and collaboration indicates in the fundamental menu, the six blossom dreams pursue an account circular segment. The player's beginning area in each stage has all the earmarks of being close to the completion area of the past one, and through the course of the diversion the player approaches a far off city. The primary dimensions center around reestablishing life and shading to the scene. In the wake of initiating a progression of windmills, the player flies through an evening field, enlightening obscured series of lights until they achieve the city. The city is loaded with threatening metal structures, little bends of power, and washed-out structures; the player breathes life into the city in the last two dimensions and changes it into a brilliant and bright spot. 

As the player advances through the diverse dimensions of the amusement, the city saw through the loft window in the dimension determination screen step by step turns out to be progressively dynamic and vivid. On the off chance that the player triggers three mystery blossoms in each dimension, the cityscape is supplanted with a brilliant field with mountains out of sight. The music changes in degree as the amusement advances, developing in scale and multifaceted nature and adding to the story circular segment. The credits level is played likewise to the principle levels, yet as the player flies through each blossom the name of an individual engaged with the diversion shows up above it. "Blossom" incorporates PlayStation Network trophies with regards to the diversion's vibe. While some are objective-based, many are focused on unwinding and viewing the landscape. 

"Blossom" was created as an otherworldly successor to "Stream", a 2006 Flash diversion made by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark while the two were understudies at the University of Southern California. "Stream" was later formed into a PlayStation 3 diversion by Thatgamecompany in 2007 and a PlayStation Portable amusement by SuperVillain Studios in 2008. "Blossom" was Thatgamecompany's "first amusement outside the security net of the scholarly community". It was first declared at the Tokyo Game Show on September 24, 2007, and was discharged on the PlayStation Network on February 12, 2009. "Blossom" was proposed essentially to incite positive feelings in the player, and to go about as "an enthusiastic sanctuary". Six to nine individuals were included at different phases of improvement. Chen, who helped to establish Thatgamecompany with diversion maker Kellee Santiago, was the imaginative chief accountable for the amusement, while Clark was the lead architect. Chen depicted the diversion as "an intelligent sonnet investigating the strain among urban and nature". He settled on the "nature" topic from the get-go in the advancement procedure, saying that he "had this idea that each PlayStation resembles an entryway in your family room, it drives you to elsewhere. I thought; wouldn't it be decent in the event that it was a gateway that would enable you to be grasped ordinarily". 

Prior to starting work, the improvement group appointed two bits of music that they felt would rouse the privilege enthusiastic tone for the amusement to manage their endeavors. They made various models, including ideas concentrated on developing blooms and based around human cognizance. The group chose that a model fixated on petals skimming in the breeze best caught the feelings they needed to bring out. They made keeping the player in a serene enthusiastic express their structure center, and evacuated components that disappointed players, for example, petal accumulation prerequisites to open dimensions and diversion mechanics that were excessively conventional and made the players excessively energized. The group attempted to not put any hindrances in the dimensions, enabling the player to go anyplace in an open world, yet understood that without a couple of rules, for example, the camera concentrating on new blooms or dividing the dimensions, players wound up confounded and baffled. Chen portrayed the procedure as "practically like we needed to discard the conventional diversion structure, however we end up getting every one of the pieces we discarded and returning them since we know those are really expected to convey a decent guided encounter". The general advancement time was two years, yet the group invested seventy five percent of that energy in the prototyping stage. In the wake of settling on the diversion components, "Blossom" was delivered in just a half year. 

The amusement's attention on feelings was started by Chen, who felt that the main role of stimulation items like computer games was the sentiments that they evoked in the gathering of people, and that the enthusiastic scope of most diversions was constrained. Chen attempted to make the amusement center more around feelings than on a message; he explicitly changed the plan of Flower when early analyzers felt there was a message of advancing environmentally friendly power vitality in the diversion. To make "Blossom" have the "passionate range" that he needed, Chen took a gander at the improvement procedure as making a masterpiece, instead of a "fun" amusement, which would not incite the ideal feelings. He outlined this view by saying that the main interactivity technician is hitting a bloom to trigger another occasion. The group explicitly removed further ongoing interaction components in light of the fact that these would have included "challenge" to the amusement, which, while fun, would not have been unwinding. Sony Santa Monica contracted with Bluepoint Games to make ports of the diversion for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, which were distributed in November 2013 to compare with the arrival of the PlayStation 4. Annapurna Interactive brought "Blossom" to the iOS stage in September 2017, and to Microsoft Windows in February 2019. 

The music for "Bloom" was made by Vincent Diamante, a computer game music writer and educator at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. He had recently scored the music for "Cloud", Chen's first amusement, and "Dyadin" when they were both at the University of Southern California. He worked legitimately with the advancement group to incorporate the music into the amusement by altering the situations of blooms and the tones that each sort played when they were come to. He did this by fitting the ongoing interaction with the music, and modifying the music progressively to compare to changes in the diversion world. Diamante utilized his music to impact the advancement group in adjusting thoughts he had for the diversion. 

The music and instruments in each dimension were picked to compare to the diversion world and the dimension's situation in the by and large enthusiastic circular segment. The music is made out of numerous layers of acoustic instrument tracks that ascent and fall in connection with the player's activities. The instruments utilized incorporate pianos, string instruments, for example, traditional guitars, and woodwinds, for example, bass woodwinds and bassoons. The quantity of instruments playing increments in connection with the measure of petals that the player accumulates. The music is intended to propose normal sounds like breeze. The instrument tracks were proposed to have the capacity to remain alone, notwithstanding when utilized in an extensive organized gathering as in levels three and six. A few times in the improvement procedure, Diamante turned out to be so appended to a bit of music that required modification that he made another piece to supplant it. Diamante was long in converses with Sony to create a collection of music from the amusement. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack collection was discharged by Sony for buy on the PlayStation Network. The collection, titled "Blossom: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game", contains 8 follows an all out length of 1:04:37.

Alice Liang of 1UP.com praised the amusement, saying that "the opportunity of development makes the diversion feel as unwinding as a tenderly floating breeze". She felt that "fun" did not completely depict the diversion experience, saying that it had an "all around developed motion picture's passionate circular segment" and that the amusement's music, visuals, and ongoing interaction all drew the player into a convincing enthusiastic encounter. She additionally felt that it was entirely replayable, which counterbalance its curtness. Ryan Clements of IGN concurred with Liang's sentiment, saying that it gave "greater delight, feeling and edification than any amusement" he had played in years. Despite the fact that he noticed that the amusement would not interest everybody, he depicted it as "something one of a kind and ground-breaking", alluding to it as an "unquestionable requirement play". Michael Kontoudis of PALGN considered it a "totally one of a kind, courageous and moving amusement overflowing with identity and expectation", however he noticed that as it was more like a gem than a diversion, numerous players would not be keen on it. Gerard Campbell of "The Press" comparably portrayed it as something in excess of an amusement, considering it an "impeccable foil" to "ultra-vicious shoot-them up" diversions and abridging it as "a standout amongst the most invigorating and loosening up recreations around". 

Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell had comparative commendation, portraying it as "charmingly honest and elevating", however he granted it a lower score than different commentators as he felt the US$9.99 cost was unreasonably high for the amusement's length. This analysis was not all inclusive, as commentators, for example, Jason Hill of "The Age" called the A$13 Australian cost "sensible" and portrayed the length as not "overstay[ing] its welcome". Pundits, for example, "GamePro"s Terry Terrones and GameTrailers reverberated indistinguishable gestures of recognition from different analysts for the diversion; GameTrailers said that it was "less an amusement and more an encounter. You don't really "play" Flower; you collaborate with it," while Terrones noticed the music as the best piece of the diversion's introduction. Tom Hoggins of "The Daily Telegraph" felt that "Blossom" would "reignite the 'computer games as craftsmanship' banter" and was of the assessment that it was an "awesome masterpiece" notwithstanding an amusement. The positive gathering amazed the designers, as they had anticipated a blended response.
