His underlying presenting was on No.Â 23 Squadron, which worked CAC Wirraways and Lockheed Hudsons out of Archerfield, Queensland. He was elevated to flying officer on 26Â December 1940. 

Two of Gibbes' cousinsâboth conceived in 1915 and, similar to Bobby, just childrenâwere likewise pilots in the RAAF. Rodney Gibbes joined the Air Force in July 1936. Dwindle Gibbes, an aircraft pilot before the war, enrolled in December 1940. Each earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, Rodney in 1940 as far as it matters for him in a Wellington plane assault in Europe while presenting with the Royal Air Force, and Peter in 1942 for his activities flying a Hudson aircraft with No.Â 1 Squadron RAAF amid the Malayan Campaign.

In April 1941, Gibbes was presented on the Middle East as aide of No.Â 450 Squadron. The next month he exchanged to No.Â 3 Squadron, which was flying Hawker Hurricanes. In June, subsequent to changing over to P-40 Tomahawks, the squadron initiated activities in the Syriaâ Lebanon Campaign. Gibbes was credited with a likely triumph over a Junkers JuÂ 88 close Bierut on 13Â June. On 11Â July he asserted his first "slaughter", a Dewoitine D.520 contender of the Vichy French aviation based armed forces, over Aleppo.

In September, No.Â 3 Squadron exchanged toward the Western Desert Campaign, where it saw activity against German and Italian powers. On 20Â November, amid Operation Crusader, Gibbes participated in the demolition of a Messerschmitt BfÂ 110 with three different pilots, crash arriving back at base with harm to his own flying machine. He had an especially effective day on 25Â November, when he shot down two Fiat G.50s and harmed three more, just as a Messerschmitt BfÂ 109. After five days he crushed a G.50 over Tobruk.

Raised to acting squadron pioneer, Gibbes was delegated leader of No.Â 3 Squadron on 26Â February 1942. The unit's Tomahawks had at this point been supplanted by Kittyhawks, and Gibbes decorated his with an animation delineating a kangaroo kicking a dachshund in the back. He guaranteed a BfÂ 109 (conceivably a misidentified Macchi C.202) amid the Siege of Tobruk on 7Â May. On 26Â May, he was shot down while driving an assault on an intensely escorted power of "Luftwaffe" aircraft close El Adem. In the wake of terminating at and most likely crushing a BfÂ 109, Gibbes was hit by flame from a JuÂ 88 and needed to safeguard. Some portion of his parachute ended up trapped with the tailplane of his stricken air ship and he attempted to get away. He broke his lower leg in the arrival yet inside about a month and a half was flying once more, his leg still in a cast. Because of his implemented nonappearance, individual expert Nicky Barr was given direction of No.Â 3 Squadron until he himself was shot down and taken prisoner on 26Â June, so, all things considered Gibbes again assumed responsibility for the unit. Barr later said that in spite of the fact that Gibbes was not a splendid shot, he had the quickest visual perception of any pilot he knew when it came to finding adversary flying machine and cautioning his colleagues for the assault. Another No.Â 3 Squadron pilot, Tom Russell, additionally reviewed that Gibbes was especially proficient at discovering targets, and that "on the off chance that we got dispersed in a dogfight he had the uncanny capacity to get us over into arrangement in an extremely short space of time". 

Gibbes was granted the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 28Â July 1942 for his activities on 26Â May, the reference taking note of his "outstanding aptitude and chivalry". On 1Â September, he decimated a BfÂ 109 and harmed two others amid the Battle of Alam el Halfa, east of El Alamein.

Air Marshal Sir Peter Drummond, Deputy Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Middle East, sent him a flag perusing "Heartiest congrats to you and all positions in the squadron on the accomplishment of your twofold centuryânot out". Around this time Gibbes likewise figured out how to fly BfÂ 109F and G contenders caught from the Germans, and left away inspired. He was credited with another BfÂ 109 on 17 November. On 21Â December, he handled his Kittyhawk in tough territory close Hun, Libya, to save an individual pilot who had been constrained down. Gibbes tossed out his own parachute to make room in the cockpit for his traveler and lost piece of his undercarriage taking off, requiring a one-wheeled arriving back at base. Suggested for the Victoria Cross for this activity, he was rather granted the Distinguished Service Order, which was declared on 15Â January 1943 and refered to his "remarkable characteristics of initiative and excitement". Gibbes himself crash arrived behind foe lines on 14Â January 1943, strolling in the desert before being gotten by a British Army watch. He was granted a bar to his DFC for this accomplishment, and for his "outstanding initiative, expertise and valor, contributing in a huge measure to the achievement of the squadron he directions".

On 22Â January 1943, Gibbes asserted his last murder, a C.202. He was authoritatively credited with a sum of 10Â¼ triumphs, however different evaluations gave him a score of 12, including two shared. He was likewise credited with five "probables", and another 16 harmed. Amid his voyage through obligation in the Middle East, he flew 274 fights and moved toward becoming No.Â 3 Squadron's longest-serving wartime boss. Squadron part Bob Smith reviewed him as lacking to some degree in managerial capacity, yet an "Errol Flynn" noticeable all around. Gibbes, as far as concerns him, later confessed to being in "an outright condition of fear" before missions, just to "kind of become mechanical" when the shooting began. He portrayed his post-battle sentiments along these lines: 

Gibbes gave over order of No.Â 3 Squadron to Squadron Leader Brian Eaton on 19Â April 1943. With his position of squadron pioneer affirmed that month, Gibbes withdrew North Africa to serve at RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, until October. While in England he changed over to de Havilland Mosquito night warriors and was slated to order No.Â 464 Squadron RAAF, yet was rather presented back on Australia, by means of Canada. There, as per Gibbes, he gave a progression of assurance building addresses on air battle to Empire Air Training Scheme understudies: "So I, you know, went round and lied like hellfire. I said that it was each of the a bit of cake." In January 1944, he joined No.Â 2 Operational Training Unit (OTU) at Mildura, Victoria, getting to be head flying teacher in March. He worked with Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring expert, to improve the achievement rate at No.Â 2 OTU by specifically choosing the most encouraging pilots from neighborhood administration flying preparing schools. Gibbes was elevated to impermanent wing officer on 1Â July. In October he was presented on Darwin in the Northern Territory, flying Supermarine Spitfires as wing pioneer of No.Â 80 Wing. The job made him appointee to Group Captain Caldwell, the wing's boss. Gibbes later endured consumes in an accident arrival following motor disappointment. In December he met, in his own words, "a little dull haired popsy" named Jeannine Ince, a volunteer with the Red Cross who had breast fed him in medical clinic. They wedded on 23Â January 1945. 

No. 80 Wing had started exchanging to the Dutch East Indies in December 1944, and the principle body followed in January 1945. Gibbes' wounds kept him from joining the arrangement at its base on Morotai, where it went under the control of the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.Â 1 TAF), until 9Â March. Once there, he took over as impermanent boss for a couple of days when Caldwell was called to Manila. In April, Gibbes was one of eight senior pilots, including Caldwell and individual pros Wilf Arthur and John Waddy, who offered their acquiescences in dissent at the assignment of RAAF contender squadrons to evidently useless ground-assault missions. The occurrence ended up known as the "Morotai Mutiny". Gibbes later proclaimed that "...Â after I myself had been working for a week or somewhere in the vicinity and had a great glance around and seen the vanity of the tasks which had been given, I couldn't perceive any point in continuing. I positively lost all astuteness for staying in the administration." As a previous jackaroo, he was particularly vexed around one foray that included assaulting steers: "I felt ghastly about it, being an ex bushyÂ ...Â at about noon I went out and darned on the off chance that I didn't need to turn butcher. What's more, Heavens, it was butchering as well, in each feeling of the word. Noânot the Japs. CattleÂ ...Â If we are to get the Japs out of this territory without loss of human lives, starvation will be our fundamental weaponÂ ...Â God, I loathed doing it however could do nothing else. Felt as debilitated as damnation." No move was made against the "rebels" for their endeavored acquiescences; an ensuing government request found that their challenge was legitimized. Meanwhile, Gibbes and Caldwell were court martialled for their contribution in liquor dealing on Morotai. Both were diminished to the position of flight lieutenant; the Air Officer Commanding No.Â 1 TAF, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, himself instantly to be expelled over the "revolt", reestablished Gibbes to squadron pioneer viable 23Â April. 

In July 1945, Gibbes was allocated to the staff of RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. Following his release from the Air Force on 11Â January 1946, he was at first utilized as a stock and station operator in Coonamble, New South Wales. He flew a Butler Bat twin-engined air ship to encourage his work, apparently the main New South Welshman in his calling to do as such at the time. Gibbes spent a great part of the following 30 years in New Guinea, spearheading the island's vehicle, espresso and accommodation enterprises. In January 1948, he framed Gibbes Sepik Airways utilizing, among different sorts, three German Junkers JuÂ 52s, one of which was said to have been the individual transport of senior "Luftwaffe" officer Albert Kesselring. He was joined quickly in this endeavor, headquartered at Wewak, by Nicky Barr. Gibbes additionally settled a tea and espresso ranch at Mount Hagen, New Guinea, in 1950, and filled in as an individual from the RAAF Active Reserve, situated in Townsville, Queensland, from 1952 until 1957. In 1958, he sold his offer in Gibbes Sepik Airways to Mandated Airlines, which was later purchased out by Ansett Australia. He kept on creating espresso ranches in New Guinea, and assembled an extensive chain of inns starting with the Bird of Paradise in Goroka. 

Gibbes sold his interests in New Guinea in 1972. He burned through the greater part of the rest of the decade in the Mediterranean, on board his sailboat "Billabong". In his 60s, he cruised "Billabong" from England to Australia without anyone else's input, conquering substantial oceans and Malaysian privateers en route. By 1979 he was living in Sydney and had started fabricating his very own twin-engined plane, which he in the long run got off the ground in 1990. In 1994, Gibbes distributed his collection of memoirs, "You Live But Once". He kept on flying until compelled to surrender his common flight permit at 85 years old. In 2002, he showed up in a scene of the TV arrangement "Australian Story" committed to Nicky Barr. Gibbes was granted the Medal of the Order of Australia on 26 January 2004 for "administration to avionics and to the travel industry, especially in Papua New Guinea". He kicked the bucket of a stroke at Mona Vale Hospital in Sydney on 11Â April 2007, matured 90, and was made due by his significant other and two little girls. His burial service at St Thomas' Church, North Sydney, was gone to by 350 grievers, including the Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Geoff Shepherd, and 40 individuals from No.Â 3 Squadron driven by the boss. A Spitfire in the "Dim Nurse" attire of one of Gibbes' World WarÂ II flying machine overflew the congregation, alongside four F/A-18 Hornet stream warriors from No.Â 3 Squadron in a "missing man" development.
