In spite of the fact that the United States was not yet at war with Germany, the US marked an arrangement to buy the domain from Denmark for 25 million dollars on March 28, 1917. President Woodrow Wilson selected James Harrison Oliver to be the primary military senator. The United States declared designs to construct a maritime base in the domain to help in the security of the Panama Canal. 

Oliver was unfit to make a trip quickly to the Islands and the respect of being the main Acting Governor of the United States Virgin Islands was chosen in a surprising way.
