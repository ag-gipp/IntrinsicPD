One day amid his childhood, Thome sneaked into the Cubs' clubhouse at Wrigley Field in a fruitless endeavor to get a signature from his most loved player, Dave Kingman.

Like his more established siblings, Thome went to Limestone High School where he accomplished all-state praises in ball and as a baseball shortstop. His High school mentor was Karl Gottlieb. He played American Legion Baseball for Bartonville Limestone Post 979 in the place where he grew up, too. In spite of the fact that he had would have liked to draw the consideration of scouts, at just he was moderately underweight for his tallness, implying that he pulled in just passing interestâthe normal Major League Baseball (MLB) player said something 1993. Thome graduated in 1988 and, after not being drafted, selected at Illinois Central College where he proceeded with his baseball and b-ball professions. After one season, he was drafted by MLB's Cleveland Indians as a "bit of hindsight" in the thirteenth round of the 1989 MLB draft. 

For the 1989 season, Thome was alloted to the Gulf Coast League Indians, a small time offshoot of the Cleveland Indians.

After seven back to back seasons with a losing record, "another ballpark and a couple offseason acquisitions combined with rising youthful stars have made the Indians authentic contenders" for the division title amid their 1994 season.

An article in "Sports Illustrated" distributed in July 1998 remarked that in spite of Thome's initial vocation achievement (two All-Star Games and appearances in two of the past three World Series), he was just "faintly popular" broadly and was not especially surely understood outside of Cleveland or the place where he grew up, Peoria. His previous partner Jeromy Burnitz stated, "You can't generally say he's misjudged, in light of the fact that everyone thinks of him as one of the top hitters in the American League, however he's encompassed by such a large number of good players, it's difficult to emerge in that group."

In spite of the fact that the development of Howard made Thome progressively disposable to the squad, another factor in his exchange to the White Sox was his family circumstance â Thome's mom, the "go-to woman" in his family and his greatest fan, had kicked the bucket a year sooner, and he stressed over his dad. Since Philadelphia was eager to exchange him, Thome deferred the no-exchange proviso in his agreement for the benefit of the group and mentioned that if conceivable, they exchange him to Chicago so he could be with his dad.

Orioles colleagues commented at Thome's duty to discussing the diversion while in the hole. Thome commented, "I talk the amusement. When I sit in the hole amid amusements, I talk baseball to these folks. They'll ask, 'Hello, what's this pitcher like?' or 'Shouldn't something be said about the diversion?'

Thome's consistency was an attract for clubs to keep on marking him, even toward the very end of his 22-year profession and after most sluggers' profitability blurs. In 2011, he was positioned the 6th best assigned hitter in MLB history by Fox Sports. Amid his vocation, he assembled a .284 batting normal against fastballs yet accumulated only a .170 batting normal against sliders. 

Since Thome was a draw hitter, restricting groups regularly utilized a protective move against him; by playing three infielders on the correct side of the field and the outfielders towards his force side, groups place themselves in better position to field batted balls. In 2011, "Lindy's Sports" portrayed him as an "incredibly quiet veteran slugger who dispatches cripple fastballs and breaking-ball slip-ups to all fields", however they noted that he struck out much of the time, had poor speed, and should serve just as an assigned hitter. Amid his profession, he had solid power numbers; in 15 of his 22 seasons, he had a slugging level of more than .500. He is a case of a "three-genuine result" player; 47.6% of his vocation plate appearances brought about either grand slams, strikeouts, or strolls, the most elevated ever by almost seven rate focuses.

Wounds, in any case, incurred significant damage and limited him only to being an assigned hitter in the last phases of his vocation. Generally speaking, he burned through 10 separate stretches on the handicapped rundown, for the most part for his back. Before the finish of Thome's vocation, his back kept him from playing the field successfully â he played a respectable starting point multiple times with the Phillies in 2012, which denoted the first occasion when he played the field since 2007 with the White Sox.

Upon his arrival to the Indians in 2011, the club again wore the high socks as a tribute. His batting position included him directing his bat toward focus field before the pitch. Thome embraced this position from Charlie Manuel, who was the Indians hitting mentor, and from that point forward Ryan Howard has likewise received it. Thome credits his quiet disposition to his good example amid his initial playing years, Eddie Murray, once remarking, 

Thome's cordial identity has been the subject of much consideration. In a 2007 survey of 464 MLB players, he tied with Mike Sweeney for second-friendliest player, behind Sean Casey. After Thome hit his 600th grand slam, Twins nearer Joe Nathan stated, "He is the world's most pleasant man." Teammate Michael Cuddyer included, "He is the most pleasant, gentlest, kindest person you will ever meetÂ ... to everything aside from the baseball, regardless he hits that actually hard." His graciousness comes up in discussions with numerous MLB players. When he marked with the Phillies in the offseason before the 2012 season, Phillies general administrator RubÃ©n Amaro, Jr. refered to Thome's consistent inspirational frame of mind as a principle explanation behind his marking. As an activity in staying humble, he every year visited his secondary school preceding spring preparing. A "Sports Illustrated" article said that Thome every now and again signs signatures for fans and that he is "perpetually persistent with solicitations". In a piece for "Philadelphia" magazine talking about Thome's Baseball Hall of Fame prospects, sportswriter Stephen Silver composed, A fan survey in "The Plain Dealer" in 2003 named him the most prominent competitor in Cleveland sports history.
