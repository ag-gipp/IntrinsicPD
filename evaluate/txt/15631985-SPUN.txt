Hannah's "recognized administration" amid the contention was perceived with his arrangement as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in June 1959. As Director-General of Plans and Policy from March 1959, he was in charge of starting the Department of Air's migration from Melbourne to Canberra. In December 1961, Hannah was selected Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, accepting advancement to acting air bad habit marshal in May 1962; the rank was made substantive in January 1963. He was later depicted by his staff officer in this job as "curt" and "unoriginal" however not unsympathetic, his "uncommunicative" way originating from an inclination to "do his very own exploration, thoroughly consider the substance of his task entries, direct to his stenographer, at that point revise to his very own fulfillment", as opposed to designate.

Hannah was elevated to air marshal on 1 January 1970, and succeeded Air Marshal Sir Alister Murdoch as Chief of the Air Staff. Murdoch had before prescribed Hannah, known to be a solid backer for Australian support in the Vietnam War, for the situation of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam when it came up for pivot toward the finish of 1969; the post went to an Army officer, and the Federal government requested the withdrawal of the RAAF nearness in Vietnam amid Hannah's visit as CAS. In March 1970, the Minister for Defense, Malcolm Fraser, authorized a survey of maritime air control. Hannah on a very basic level couldn't help contradicting any proposal that the Royal Australian Navy ought to work land-based flying machine, guaranteeing that he was contending not from a factional point of view but rather to guarantee that Australia's constrained resistance assets were not spread crosswise over three administrations. Classified RAAF papers from the time pronounced that its objective was dependably to "abstain from allowing the Navy the chance to set up a land-based aviation based armed forces". After two years, Hannah reacted positively to a proposal from the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Admiral Sir Victor Smith, to utilize the destined to-be-conveyed F-111 plane for sea support, among different jobs. 

In the 1971 New Year Honors, Hannah was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). His visit as CAS corresponded with the RAAF's Golden Jubilee, celebrated in March and April that year.

He was additionally associated with two disputable choices that year. Right off the bat, he was an individual from the council to pick an Air Force commemoration to be situated on Anzac Parade, Canberra. The chose plan was a dynamic figure that, as indicated by authority RAAF history specialist Alan Stephens, mirrored "the choice board's extensive inability to comprehend the idea of aviation based armed forces administration". Besides, Hannah charged a swap for the Air Force's winter uniform, customarily a shade "somewhere close to regal and naval force blue" that had been actually picked by the RAAF's first CAS, Wing Commander (later Air Marshal Sir) Richard Williams, to recognize it from the lighter Royal Air Force shading. Hannah openly appeared the uniform that he affirmed, a universally handy center blue suit, at a Point Cook graduation march on 8 December 1971. It was the object of much antagonistic remark in the following years; faculty griped of being confused with transport, train and postal representatives. One of Hannah's successors as CAS, Air Marshal Errol McCormack, requested that the uniform return to Williams' unique shading and style beginning in 2000. 

Hannah's arranged three-year term as Chief of the Air Staff was stopped by somewhere in the range of ten months when he acknowledged an idea to fill in as Governor of Queensland, turning into the principal officer in the RAAF to get a bad habit great arrangement.

Hannah did not have a solid association with Queensland at the season of his arrangement, and had just lived in the state amid his period as administrator of RAAF Station Amberley somewhere in the range of 1949 and 1951. He asserted not to have effectively looked for the governorship, and was scrutinized for neglecting to counsel with senior partners before settling on his choice to resign ahead of schedule from his situation as leader of the Air Force. He was supplanted as CAS by his representative, Air Vice Marshal (later Air Marshal Sir) Charles Read. 

Portrayed when he got to work as "a man with the adaptability of psyche and capacity to blend with individuals, so fundamental for a Governor", Hannah was designated a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) and a Knight and Deputy Prior of the Venerable Order of Saint John in September 1972. His term as Governor was moderately uneventful until 1975. In October that year, he made debate at a Brisbane Chamber of Commerce lunch get-together by reprimanding the "bungling clumsiness" of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's Federal Labor government for putting Australia in "its present monetary state". Bad habit great representatives in Australia were required to stay above legislative issues, yet Hannah announced that he would be "liable of protecting behind tradition, of denying my legacy and bombing in my respect for the general population of Queensland" on the off chance that he didn't talk his psyche. The episode happened amidst an established emergency and, as per military history specialist Chris Coulthard-Clark, was "generally observed as an outright intercession in the national political field". The Federal government reacted by encouraging the Queen to disavow Hannah's lethargic bonus to serve instead of the Governor-General whenever required; at the time Hannah was the second in line to fill in as Governor-General, after the Governor of New South Wales. Following his progression in November 1975, Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser endeavored to have the torpid commission reestablished, however the Queen â clearly following guidance from the British government that refered to Hannah's absence of unprejudiced nature â declined her consent. At the point when Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen looked to expand the Governor's expression, the British government again declined. At the point when Bjelke-Petersen tried to seek after the issue further, Hannah declined to give his name a chance to be advanced once more. 

On 9 October 1976, Hannah devoted a remembrance at Cairns to recognize the groups of RAAF Catalina flying water crafts who lost their lives in the South West Pacific amid World WarÂ II. His bad habit majestic arrangement passed on 20 March 1977, and he was succeeded the following month by Commodore Sir James Ramsay.

He was designated a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in August 1977 (predated to March) as a component of Queen ElizabethÂ II's Silver Jubilee visit to Australia.

Hannah Community Park, straddling suburbia of Fadden and Gowrie in Canberra, was built up in his respect in 2002.
