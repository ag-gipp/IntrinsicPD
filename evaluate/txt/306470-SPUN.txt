Mystery of Mana, initially discharged in Japan as Seiken Densetsu 2, is a 1993 activity pretending diversion created and distributed by Square (presently Square Enix) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the continuation of the 1991 diversion "Seiken Densetsu", discharged in North America as "Conclusive Fantasy Adventure" and in Europe as "Spiritualist Quest", and it was the first "Seiken Densetsu" title to be advertised as a feature of the "Mana" arrangement as opposed to the "Last Fantasy" arrangement. Set in a high dream universe, the amusement pursues three saints as they endeavor to keep a domain from overcoming the world with the intensity of an antiquated flying fortification. 

As opposed to utilizing a turn-based fight framework like contemporaneous pretending recreations, "Mystery of Mana" includes ongoing fights with a power bar technician. The amusement has a special Ring Command menu framework, which stops the activity and enables the player to settle on choices amidst fight. An inventive helpful multiplayer framework enables a second or third player to drop all through the diversion whenever. "Mystery of Mana" was coordinated and structured by Koichi Ishii, customized principally by Nasir Gebelli, and delivered by veteran Square planner Hiromichi Tanaka. 

The diversion got significant praise for its splendidly hued designs, extensive plot, Ring Command menu framework, and inventive ongoing fight framework. Pundits likewise adulated the soundtrack by Hiroki Kikuta and the adaptable man-made consciousness (AI) settings for PC controlled partners. 

The first form was discharged for the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console in Japan in September 2008, and for the Wii U's Virtual Console in June 2013. The amusement was ported to cell phones in Japan in 2009, and an upgraded port of the diversion was discharged for iOS in 2010 and Android in 2014. Nintendo re-discharged "Mystery of Mana" in September 2017 as a feature of the organization's Super NES Classic Edition. A full 3D change was discharged for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Microsoft Windows in February 2018. In any case, the first staff was not engaged with the 3D redo's advancement. 

In the same way as other pretending rounds of the 16-bit period, "Mystery of Mana" shows a top-down point of view, in which the player characters explore the territory and fend off unfriendly animals. The diversion highlights three such characters: the saint, the young lady, and the sprite, named Randi, Primm, and Popoi outside the underlying North American and European discharges. The player can control every one of the characters whenever; whichever character is as of now chosen, the other two mates are controlled by means of man-made brainpower. The diversion might be played at the same time by up to three players, made conceivable by the Super Multitap extra for the Super NES reassure. The Virtual Console form of the amusement underpins three-player interactivity by means of extra GameCube controllers or Classic Controllers. 

Each character has singular qualities and shortcomings. The legend, while unfit to utilize enchantment, experts weapons at a faster rate; the young lady is a healer, ready to cast remedial and bolster spells; and the sprite throws hostile enchantment to harm and disable foes. After gathering enough experience focuses in fight, each character increments in level and improves in zones, for example, quality and avoidance. The trio can rest in towns, where they can recover hit focuses or buy therapeutic things and hardware. Choices, for example, evolving hardware, throwing spells, or checking status are performed by spinning through the amusement's Ring Commands, a roundabout menu which floats over the at present controlled gathering part. The amusement is quickly stopped at whatever point the Ring Commands show up. 

Battle happens continuously. Situated at the base of the screen is a power bar, a check that decides the measure of harm done to an adversary while assaulting. Swinging a weapon makes the measure vacant and afterward rapidly revive, enabling that character to assault at full quality. The gathering uses eight unique sorts of weaponry: sword, stick, bow, hatchet, boomerang, glove, whip, and lance. All weapons can be updated multiple times, and rehashed utilization of a weapon expands its aptitude level to a limit of eight, opening another extraordinary assault with each dimension. Weapons are overhauled with Weapon Orbs, which are found in prisons or earned by crushing certain managers. The player takes each Orb to a metalworker, situated in many towns, who utilizes it to reforge one weapon. 

So as to learn enchantment, the gathering must protect spirits known as Elementals. The eight Elementals speak to various components, for example, water, earth, and lifeâand each gives the player explicit spells. Enchantment has ability levels like weapons, yet every enchantment spell costs enchantment focuses to cast. 

Toward the beginning of the diversion, to achieve a goal players must cross an adversary swarmed farmland. Travel might be sped up with Cannon Travel Centers, where the gathering might be propelled to faraway goals by means of a goliath gun. Gun Travel more often than not requires an expense, however is compulsory to visit different mainlands later on. Afterward, the gathering is offered access to Flammie, a smaller than usual mythical beast which is constrained by the player and ready to fly openly over the world, spoken to by an overworld map. These groupings utilize the SNES's Mode 7 capacity to make a rotatable foundation, giving the dream that the ground underneath Flammie is rendered in three measurements. While riding Flammie, the player may get to either the "turned guide", which exhibits the world as a globe, or the "world guide", a two-dimensional perspective on the overworld. 

The story happens in a high dreamland, which contains an ethereal vitality source named "mana". An antiquated, innovatively propelled progress abused mana to develop the "Mana Fortress", a flying warship. This rankled the world's divine beings, who sent goliath monsters to war with the human advancement. The contention was all around dangerous and about depleted all indications of mana on the planet, until a saint utilized the intensity of the Mana Sword to wreck the stronghold and the human progress. The world started to recuperate in harmony. As the amusement opens, a realm looks for eight Mana Seeds, which when "unlocked" will reestablish mana to the world and enable the domain to reestablish the Mana Fortress. 

The three fundamental characters don't have names in the first SNES discharge, however their names show up in the manual of the Japanese discharge; and their names were included into the amusement in the iOS port around the world. In all forms, the player can name the characters whatever they wish. The , a young man, is received by the Elder of Potos before the beginning of the amusement, after the kid's mom vanishes. The is enamored with a warrior named Dyluck, who was requested by the lord to assault Elinee's Castle. Rankled by the ruler's activities and by her dad's endeavor to orchestrate her marriage to a nearby aristocrat, she leaves the stronghold to spare Dyluck and to go with the legend also. The saint and the young lady meet the at the Dwarf Village. The sprite brings home the bacon by misleading individuals at a monstrosity show held by dwarves. It doesn't recollect that anything about its past, so it joins the group to attempt to recoup its recollections. 

The amusement starts as three young men from the little Potos town defy their Elder's directions and trespass into a nearby cascade, where a fortune is said to be kept. One of the young men falters and falls into the lake, where he finds a corroded sword implanted in a stone. Guided by a bodiless voice, he pulls the sword free, unintentionally releasing beasts in the encompassing wide open of the town. The locals decipher the sword's expulsion as an awful sign and exile the kid from Potos until the end of time. A voyaging knight named Jema perceives the cutting edge as the unbelievable Mana Sword and urges the saint to re-stimulate it by visiting the eight Mana Temples. 

Amid his voyage, the saint is joined by the young lady and the sprite. All through their movements, the trio is sought after by the domain. The Emperor and his subordinates are being controlled by Thanatos, an antiquated magician who would like to make "another, tranquil world". Because of his own body's decay, Thanatos need an appropriate body to have. In the wake of setting the whole kingdom of Pandora under a daze, he kidnaps two hopefuls: Dyluck, presently subjugated, and a youthful Pandoran young lady named Phanna; he in the end has Dyluck. 

The Empire prevails with regards to unlocking every one of the eight Mana Seeds. In any case, Thanatos deceives the Emperor and his cohorts, executing them and catching control of the Mana Fortress for himself. The saint and his gathering adventure to find the Mana Tree, the point of convergence of the world's life vitality. Foreseeing their landing, Thanatos positions the Mana Fortress over the Tree and crushes it. The burned survives from the Tree address the legends, clarifying that a goliath winged serpent called the Mana Beast will before long be gathered to battle the Fortress. Be that as it may, the Beast has little authority over its fury and will probably annihilate the world also. The Mana Tree likewise uncovers that it was at one time the human spouse of Serin, the first Mana Knight and the legend's dad. The voice heard at Potos' cascade was that of Serin's apparition. 

The trio flies to the Mana Fortress and stands up to Thanatos, who is getting ready to move his psyche into Dyluck. With the remainder of his quality, Dyluck cautions that Thanatos has sold his spirit to the black market and should not be permitted to have the Fortress. Dyluck slaughters himself, driving Thanatos to return to a skeletal lich structure, which the gathering massacres. The Mana Beast at last flies in and assaults the Fortress. The legend communicates hesitance to murder the Beast, expecting that with the dispersal of Mana from the world, the sprite will evaporate. With the sprite's consolation, he utilizes the completely invigorated Mana Sword to kill the Beast, making it detonate and change into snow. At the finish of the diversion, the saint is seen invited back in Potos, restoring the Mana Sword to its place underneath the cascade. 

"Mystery of Mana" was coordinated and planned by Koichi Ishii, the maker of the diversion's Game Boy ancestor, "Last Fantasy Adventure". He has expressed that he feels "Mystery of Mana" is more "his diversion" than different activities he has chipped away at, for example, the "Last Fantasy" arrangement. The amusement was customized essentially by Nasir Gebelli and delivered by veteran Square architect Hiromichi Tanaka. The group planned to expand on the establishment of "Definite Fantasy Adventure", and they incorporated a few adjusted components from that amusement and from other well known Square titles "Covertly of Mana". Notwithstanding having preferable illustrations and sound quality over its forerunner, the assault control check was changed to be additionally captivating, and the weapon leveling framework supplanted "Last Fantasy Adventure"s arrangement of step up the speed of the assault measure. The gathering framework likewise got an overhaul from the first "Mana" diversion: rather than transitory partners who couldn't be redesigned, party individuals ended up perpetual heroes and could be constrained by different players. The multiplayer segment was not a piece of the first structure, however was included when the engineers understood that they could without much of a stretch make every one of the three characters human-controlled. 

The constant fight framework utilized "Covertly of Mana" has been depicted by its makers as an augmentation of the fight framework utilized in the initial three leader "Last Fantasy" titles. The framework for experience focuses and step up was taken from "Definite Fantasy III". As indicated by Tanaka, the amusement's fight framework highlights mechanics that had first been considered for "Conclusive Fantasy IV". Also, unused highlights "Covertly of Mana" were appropriated by the "Chrono Trigger" group, which like "Last Fantasy IV" was underway at the time. 

"Mystery of Mana" was initially wanted to be a dispatch title for the SNES-CD add-on. After the agreement among Nintendo and Sony to create the extra fizzled, and Sony repurposed its work on the SNES-CD into the contending PlayStation comfort, Square adjusted the amusement for the SNES cartridge design. The amusement must be changed to fit the extra room of a SNES diversion cartridge, which is a lot littler than that of a CD-ROM. The engineers at first opposed proceeding with the venture without the CD add-on, trusting that a lot of the amusement would need to be cut, yet they were overruled by organization the executives. Because of the equipment change, a few highlights must be cut from the diversion, and some finished work should have been revamped. A standout amongst the most critical changes was the expulsion of the choice to take numerous courses through the amusement that prompted a few conceivable endings, rather than the straight voyage in the last item. The plot that remained was not quite the same as the first origination, and Tanaka has said that the first story had an a lot darker tone. Ishii has evaluated that up to 40% of the arranged amusement was dropped to meet the space restrictions, and commentators have recommended that the equipment change prompted specialized issues when an excessive amount of occurs without a moment's delay in the diversion. In 2006, "Level" magazine guaranteed that "Mystery of Mana"s rough improvement was Square's principle motivation to move their recreations, for example, the "Last Fantasy" arrangement, from Nintendo consoles to Sony reassures in 1996. 

The English interpretation for "Mystery of Mana" was finished in just 30 days, simple weeks after the Japanese discharge, and the North American confinement was at first promoted as "Definite Fantasy Adventure 2". Commentators have proposed that the interpretation was done hurriedly with the goal that the diversion could be discharged in North America for the 1993 Christmas season. As indicated by interpreter Ted Woolsey, a vast segment of the amusement's content was removed in the English confinement because of space constraints. To show message on the fundamental ongoing interaction screen, the English interpretation utilizes a fixed-width textual style, which restrains the measure of room accessible to show content. Woolsey was troubled that he needed to trim discussions to their minimum necessities and that he possessed so little energy for interpretation, remarking that it "almost murdered me". The content was hard to decipher as it was introduced to Woolsey in cluttered gatherings of content, such as "rearranging a novel". Different confinements were done in German and French. The Japanese discharge just named the three heroes in the manual, while Western variants discarded the characters' names until the upgraded port on the iOS. 

The first score for "Mystery of Mana" was created and delivered by Hiroki Kikuta. Kenji Ito, who had formed the soundtrack for "Definite Fantasy Adventure", was initially slated for the venture, yet was supplanted with Kikuta after he had begun on different tasks, for example, "Romancing SaGa". "Mystery of Mana" was Kikuta's first computer game score, and he experienced challenges in managing the equipment confinements of the Super NES. Kikuta endeavored to express in the music two "differentiating styles" to make a unique score which would be neither popular music nor standard amusement music. Kikuta took a shot at the music for the most part without anyone else's input, going through about 24Â hours every day in his office, shifting back and forth among forming and altering to make a soundtrack that would be, as indicated by him, "vivid" and "three-dimensional". As opposed to having sound specialists make the examples of instruments like most amusement music arrangers of the time, Kikuta made his very own examples that coordinated the equipment capacities of the Super NES. These custom examples enabled him to realize precisely how each piece would sound on the framework's equipment, so he didn't need to stress over contrasts between the first creation and the Super NES. Kikuta expressed in 2001 that he considered the score for "Mystery of Mana" his most loved creation. 

The soundtrack's music incorporates both "foreboding" and "happy" tracks, and is noted for its utilization of ringers and "dim, grave pianos". Kikuta's arrangements for the amusement were halfway roused by common scenes, just as music from Bali. Equipment confinements made the title screen to the amusement gradually blur in, and Kikuta structured the title track to the diversion, "Dread of the Heavens", to match up with the screen. Around then, authors seldom attempted to coordinate a diversion's music to its visuals. Kikuta likewise began the track off with a "whale commotion", as opposed to a customary "ping", so as to attempt to "all the more profoundly associate" the player with the diversion from the minute it began up. Getting the sound to work with the memory constraints of the Super NES was a troublesome specialized test. 

An official soundtrack collection, "Seiken Densetsu 2 Original Sound Version", was discharged in Japan in August 1993, containing 44 melodic tracks from the amusement. An English rendition, indistinguishable to the Japanese unique beside its limited bundling and track titles, was later discharged in North America in December 1994 as "Mystery of Mana Original Soundtrack", making "Mystery of Mana" one of the main Japanese recreations to move a restricted soundtrack discharge outside of Japan. A collection of orchestrated music from "Mystery of Mana" and its spin-off "Seiken Densetsu 3" was created in 1993 as "Mystery of Mana+". The music in the collection was altogether formed and organized by Kikuta. "Mystery of Mana+" contains a solitary track, titled "Mystery of Mana", that consolidates topics from the music of both "Mystery of Mana" and "Seiken Densetsu 3", which was still a work in progress at the time. The style of the collection has been depicted by faultfinders as "test", utilizing "unusual sounds, for example, cascades, feathered creature calls, PDA sounds, and "composing" sounds. The music has additionally been portrayed by faultfinders as covering a wide range of melodic styles, for example, "Debussian impressionist styles, his very own substantial electronic and synth thoughts, and even thoughts of prevalent performers". The most recent collection of music from the diversion is a 2012 masterminded collection titled "Mystery of Mana Genesis/Seiken Densetsu 2 Arrange Album". The 16 tracks are redesigned variants of the first Super NES tracks, and Kikuta said in the liner notes for the collection that they are "the means by which he needed the music to sound when he composed it", without the confinements of the Super NES equipment. Pundits, for example, Patrick Gann of RPGFan, in any case, noticed that the distinctions were minor. Music for the 2018 redo, which highlights remastered renditions of the first soundtrack, was supervised by Kikuta and organized by various diversion authors, for example, Yuzo Koshiro and Tsuyoshi Sekito. The soundtrack was discharged as a collection, additionally titled "Mystery of Mana Original Soundtrack", not long after the change's discharge in February 2018.

The abroad figure is tested by "People to come", who guarantee that the amusement sold more than 500,000 duplicates in the only us. The underlying shipment of diversions in Japan sold out inside days of the discharge date. "Edge" noted in November 1993 that the amusement was "the most broadly secured round of the year in Japan", with a high number of offers, yet was discharged in North America "totally un-advertised and for the most part incomprehensible".
