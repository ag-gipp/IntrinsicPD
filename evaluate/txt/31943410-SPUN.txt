The Rios sold the pony as a two-year-old to Jim Culver of Dream Team One Racing Stable, keeping a proprietorship share for themselves. After Mucho Macho Man's first race in 2010, a dominant part share in the yearling was acquired by Dean and Patti Reeves, proprietors of Reeves Thoroughbred Racing of Suwanee, Georgia, close Atlanta.

A proficient horseman, Green demanded that as a state of business he reserved the option to advocate for what was best for a pony under his administration, regardless of whether that implied communicating difference and forcing "intense love" on the proprietors. He and Ritvo saw eye to eye on Mucho Macho Man, and they started arranging the yearling's arrival to the track. After a break of very nearly five months, Mucho Macho Man dashed in November and won a recompense race at Aqueduct, starting a three-race series of wins. He had lost his "toddler" look, put on weight, and as Ritvo put it, "His shoulders [caught] up with his behind."

It was a noteworthy responsibility for the pony's group, as Ritvo, Green, Petro, Tapia and Lopez needed to leave their command post in Florida, and Reeves needed to cover the costs.

The steed's next race was the Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita on September 28. Since both Smith and Prado had earlier riding responsibilities, Ritvo and Green chose to contact Gary Stevens.
