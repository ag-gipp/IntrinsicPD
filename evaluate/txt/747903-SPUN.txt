Ravenloft is an undertaking module for the "Prisons and Dragons" ("D&D") dream pretending amusement. The American amusement distributing organization TSR, Inc. discharged it as an independent experience booklet in 1983 for use with the primary version "Propelled Dungeons and Dragons" diversion. It was composed by Tracy and Laura Hickman, and incorporates workmanship by Clyde Caldwell with maps by David SutherlandÂ III.

In 1984, it won the Strategists' Club Award for Outstanding Play Aid, and it seemed second in "Prison" magazine's rundown of the main 30 "D&D" undertakings. A few analysts preferred the included maps, and "White Dwarf" magazine gave it 8 out of 10 by and large. A "Mythical beast" magazine audit lauded the module, yet felt that the "D&D" components brought down the Gothic repulsiveness environment. In 2016, Wizards of the Coast distributed "Revile of Strahd", an adjustment of the first Ravenloft module for the fifth version of "Cells and Dragons." 

The story includes a gathering of player characters (PCs) who travel to the place where there is Barovia, a little country encompassed by a destructive mystical mist. The ace of close-by Castle Ravenloft, Count Strahd von Zarovich, overbearingly runs the nation, and an introduction clarifies that the inhabitants must blockade their entryways every night to stay away from assaults by Strahd and his followers. The Burgomaster's manor is the focal point of these assaults, and, for reasons that are not at first clarified, Strahd is after the Burgomaster's embraced little girl, Ireena Kolyana. 

Before play starts, the Dungeon Master (or DM, the player who sorts out and coordinates the amusement play) haphazardly draws five cards from a deck of six. Two of these cards decide the areas of two mystical weapons helpful in overcoming Strahd: the Holy Symbol and the Sunsword. The following two cards decide the areas of Strahd and the "Tome of Strahd", a book that subtleties Strahd's quite a while in the past pathetic love. In this work, it is uncovered that Strahd had experienced passionate feelings for a young lady, who thus cherished his more youthful sibling. Strahd reprimanded his age for the dismissal, and made a settlement with underhandedness forces to live until the end of time. He at that point slew his sibling, yet the young lady slaughtered herself accordingly, and Strahd found that he had turned into a vampire. Every one of the six conceivable areas are inside Castle Ravenloft. 

The fifth and last card chose decides Strahd's inspiration. There are four conceivable inspirations for Strahd. He might need to supplant one of the PCs and endeavor to transform the character into a vampire and assume that personality's structure. He may want the adoration for Ireena, whose appearance coordinates that of his lost love, Tatyana. Utilizing mind control, Strahd will attempt to drive a PC to assault Ireena and addition her affection by "sparing" her from the circumstance he made. Strahd may likewise need to make an insidious enchantment thing, or decimate the Sunsword. In the case of, amid play, the gathering's fortune is told at the rover camp in Barovia, the irregular components are changed to coordinate the cards drawn by the wanderer. 

As the gathering ventures through Barovia and the stronghold, the diversion play is guided utilizing 12 maps with comparing segments in the book's body control. Model maps and segments incorporate the Lands of Barovia, the Court of the Count, five passages for each dimension of the Spires of Ravenloft, and the Dungeons and Catacombs. Every area contains fortune and foes, including zombies, wolves, devils, apparitions, and different animals. The principle goal of the diversion is to annihilate Count Strahd. The DM is told to play the vampire insightfully, and to keep him alive as far as might be feasible, influencing him to escape when important. In a discretionary epilog, Ireena is brought together with her darling. They leave the "mortal world" as Ireena says, "Through these numerous hundreds of years we have played out the deplorability of our lives." 

Tracy Hickman and Laura Curtis wedded in 1977. Before long, while living in Provo, Utah, they composed the undertakings "Pharaoh" and "Ravenloft". When they started take a shot at "Ravenloft", they felt the vampire model had progressed toward becoming abused, trite, and ordinary, and chose to make an unnerving variant of the animal for the module. They play-tried it with a gathering of players each Halloween for a long time before it was distributed in 1983 by TSR. The plot joined components of the ghastliness kind with "Cells and Dragons" traditions out of the blue. At the season of "Ravenloft's" discharge, every "Cells and Dragons" module was set apart with an alphanumeric code showing the arrangement to which it had a place. "Ravenloft" was marked I6: the 6th in a progression of moderate dimension modules for the main release of "Cutting edge Dungeons and Dragons" ("AD&D"). It comprised of a 32-page book, with isolated maps that nitty gritty areas in the experience situation. 

Tracy Hickman once ran the experience as a Dungeon Master. As indicated by him, the experience resembled an old frightening motion picture, with "the mandatory mansion high on the rough precipice with the wolves crying in the forested areas. Beyond any doubt enough, the vampire was up there in the stronghold. To a large portion of the players it appeared to be a straight forward undertaking: discover the vampire and kill him." One player found Strahd's backstory and was so influenced by it that when it came time to kill the vampire toward the finish of the experience, notwithstanding having a sword equipped for dispatching Strahd, he can't, and his sidekicks were compelled to finish the errand. Thereafter, Hickman asked him for what valid reason. "He had the right beyond words than that," his companion stated, to which Hickman answered "Yes [...] But that is the way it is with individuals who tumble from significance. He picked his end when he originally executed his sibling. How might it be any unique?". 

As indicated by a Wizards of the Coast article, Strahd has turned out to be a standout amongst the most notorious and surely understood reprobates in the "Cells and Dragons" amusement, and he has showed up in various books and rulebooks since his presentation in "Ravenloft". In a prologue to an online release of "RavenloftÂ II", creator John D. Rateliff depicted Strahd as a then-irregular combination of a beast with the capacities of a player character class; that is, a vampire enchantment client. This plan empowers him to consolidate his own forces with the encompassing condition, making him a troublesome rival to overcome. 

To praise the 25th commemoration of the "Cells and Dragons" amusement in 1999, two extra forms of the "Ravenloft" module were discharged. The first was a republishing of the first experience made accessible in the "Cells and Dragons Silver Anniversary Collector's Edition" boxed set, with slight adjustments to make it discernable from the first (for gathering purposes). The second was the silver commemoration version of "Ravenloft" that was adjusted for use with the second release "Propelled Dungeons and Dragons" (Wizards of the Coast intermittently changes the principles of Dungeons and Dragons and discharges another form). 

"Ravenloft's" achievement prompted a spin-off in 1986 titled Ravenloft II: The House on Griffin Hill. In spite of the fact that Tracy Hickman was credited in "RavenloftÂ II", he had left TSR before the module was finished. The composing was finished by David "Zeb" Cook, Jeff Grubb, Harold Johnson, and Douglas Niles, following the Hickmans' framework. Every author sought after an alternate segment of the module so as to comply with the time constraint. Clyde Caldwell, who had done the majority of the workmanship for the first "Ravenloft" module, gave the spread, however inside craftsmanship was finished by Jeff Easley. The experience is intended for first release "Propelled Dungeons and Dragons" characters of levels 8â 10. The experience was 48 pages, and incorporated a substantial shading map and an external envelope. It imparted basic components to the first, including variable NPC objectives and variable areas for key articles, so that "Griffin Hill" plays diversely each time. The module's plot includes a curio known as "The Apparatus" that switches a beast's identity with that of a conventional townsperson; player characters, subsequently, are questionable about the genuine personality of the general population they meet. The module likewise presents Azalin the lich, who later turned into a noteworthy character in the Ravenloft crusade setting. This module is playable alone, or as a spin-off of the first "Ravenloft". It incorporates depictions of the town of Mordentshire, just as some spooky fields, and a lodge, all mapped in context like the first module.

In the book, the peruser assumes the job of Jeren Sureblade, a paladin, who must annihilation Count Strahd von Zarovich to spare a young lady from getting to be one of the undead. The gamebook was composed by Jean Blashfield, with spread craftsmanship by Clyde Caldwell and inside workmanship by Gary Williams. 

"Ravenloft" roused a battle setting of a similar name, distributed in 1990. The "" boxed set was distributed as a feature of the second release of "Cutting edge Dungeons and Dragons" and, as per its back spread, it is "established in the Gothic convention" and contains "tips for adding apprehension to your amusements". The setting of the module was extended; Ravenloft is presently a demiplane (a substitute measurement). The boxed set's adaptation of Strahd is like character in the first experience, yet his capacities were expanded and his experience clarified in more detail. The battle setting has delivered various turn offs, and this new form of Strahd was utilized as a noteworthy character in various books. 

The first "Ravenloft" module has been reconsidered and extended multiple times. In 1993, TSR distributed "Place of Strahd" (module code RM4). It was refreshed to incorporate standards from the second version of "Cutting edge Dungeons and Dragons". The module credits the first work by the Hickmans, however was overhauled by Bruce Nesmith, who alongside Andria Hayday made the "Ravenloft" crusade setting. Nesmith presented some new animals, built up Strahd's strategies further, and included a Time-Track Table with the goal that the ref can envision the nightfall. In October 2006, Wizards of the Coast discharged a refreshed and extended variant of the first module for "Prisons and Dragons" adaptation 3.5 as a 226-page hardcover book entitled "Undertaking to Castle Ravenloft". It depended on the first module, and not the "Ravenloft" material made in the mediating years. "Endeavor to Castle Ravenloft" is intended to be played as a little battle enduring around 20 amusement sessions, any longer than the first module, in spite of the fact that it contains alternatives for running long 8-session or short 4-session experiences. The book additionally incorporates proposals for joining the experience into a current conventional setting, Forgotten Realms, Eberron or d20 Modern battle. Wizards of the Coast discharged the prepackaged game "Palace Ravenloft" in 2010 as a feature of the "Experience System" arrangement of tabletop games utilizing a disentangled fourth release rule set. In 2016, Wizards of the Coast distributed "Revile of Strahd", an adjustment of the first Ravenloft module for the fifth version of "Cells and Dragons", which was commonly generally welcomed, acquiring the 2016 ENnie Awards for Best Adventure and Best Art/Cover and sprinter up for Product of the Year. 

"Ravenloft" won one honor, and was incorporated on two "best of" records. In 1984, it won the Strategists' Club Award for Outstanding Play Aid. The book "Prison Master For Dummies" picked the module as one of the ten best exemplary undertakings, saying it is "maybe our top pick "D&D" experience ever", "Ravenloft" "takes the Dracula legend and gives it a "D&D" turn", and applauded the nitty gritty yet compact plot and isometric maps. The book likewise asserts that Ravenloft "enlivened diversion architects and Dungeon Masters to take the craft of experience to the following dimension." 

In 2004, on the 30th commemoration of the "Cells and Dragons" diversion, "Prison" magazine positioned the module as the second most prominent "Prisons and Dragons" experience everâbehind "Ruler of the Spiders". The manager of "Prison" applauded the situation of fortune, and Strahd's inspiration was portrayed as "a splendid method to give destiny a chance to drive the plot and bring out the riddle and persona of Barovia". Bill Slavicsek, executive of Wizards of the Coast's RPGs and Miniatures division, noticed that it was the main experience to "blend tone, story, and cell slither" in a module, and amusement planner Andy Collins concurred. Clark Peterson, leader of Necromancer Games, singled out the maps and Strahd for acclaim, saying the vampire is "maybe a standout amongst the best antagonists ever". Creator John Rateliff additionally commended the maps and the randomization, just as Strahd's duality as a vampire/enchantment client. The sepulchers, where player characters were transported away and supplanted with undead wights, was singled out at as the experience's "pivotal turning point" by the magazine's editors. 

Audits for "Ravenloft" were commonly positive. Rick Swan looked into the experience in "The Space Gamer" No. 72. He remarked that there was "so much gothic climate in "Ravenloft" that in the event that it had any more, it'd fold its pages and fly away", and expressed that the main part of the experience including a hunt of Castle Ravenloft was "not very intriguing" with experiences rare, and that the specialist of utilizing an ordinary deck of cards to reenact a wanderer seer was "senseless and the outcomes are excessively subjective" however presumed that ""Ravenloft" is such a reviving change, that even with its issues, it's prescribed." In the July 1984 issue of "White Dwarf" magazine, the module was given 8 out of 10 by and large, with the analyst referencing its introduction as a positive, and its unpredictability as a negative. It was compared to a Hammer awfulness creation and commended as pleasant, despite the fact that the analyst said the diversion's plays on words were dull and cheapened the creepy climate. "White Dwarf" commentator Dave Morris said it "ought to be a ton of fun â 'light, alleviation' of a nerve-wracking and dangerous sort" and reasoned that "Ravenloft" is "loaded with shrewd contacts", and "highlights some top of the line delineation and illustrations". In an audit for the January 1984 issue of "Winged serpent" magazine (distributed by an auxiliary of TSR), amusement creator Ken Rolston contended that, in spite of its structure advancements, "Ravenloft" was still generally a cell style experience. Rolston lauded the randomization, the maps, and the player content (which is perused so anyone might hear to the players by the DM). He said the player content "reliably builds up an air of obscurity and rot." Despite this, Rolston felt that the experience experiences difficulty in building up an alarming tone. He singles out its utilization of regular beasts in "D&D", a plenitude of devices, and incessant battle intervals as components that take away from the experience's creepiness by intruding on the module's stream. Eventually, he felt that in "AD&D terms it is an artful culmination", however not a work of "Gothic loathsomeness". Tracy Hickman expressed in 1998, "despite everything I trust the first Ravenloft modules were maybe the best that at any point had my name on them."
