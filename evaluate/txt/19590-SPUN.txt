Minnesota () is a state in the Upper Midwest and northern districts of the United States. Minnesota was conceded as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, made from the eastern portion of the Minnesota Territory. The state has a substantial number of lakes, and is known by the motto the "Place that is known for 10,000 Lakes". Its official proverb is "L'Ã©toile du Nord" (French: "Star of the North"). 

Minnesota is the twelfth biggest in territory and the 22nd most crowded of the U.S. states; almost 60% of its inhabitants live in the Minneapolisâ Saint Paul metropolitan zone (known as the "Twin Cities"). This territory is the focal point of transportation, business, industry, training, and government, while being home to a universally known expressions network. The rest of the state comprises of western prairies currently offered over to escalated horticulture; deciduous backwoods in the southeast, presently somewhat cleared, cultivated, and settled; and the less populated North Woods, utilized for mining, ranger service, and entertainment. 

Minnesota was occupied by different indigenous people groups for a huge number of years preceding the landing of Europeans. French pilgrims, evangelists, and hide merchants started investigating the area in the seventeenth century, experiencing the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe clans. A lot of what is today Minnesota was a piece of the huge French holding of Louisiana, which was acquired by the United States in 1803. Following a few regional rearrangements, Minnesota in its present structure was conceded as the nation's 32nd state on May 11, 1858. In the same way as other Midwestern states, it remained inadequately populated and fixated on wood and farming. Amid the nineteenth and mid twentieth hundreds of years, countless workers, fundamentally from Scandinavia and Germany, started to settle the state, which remains a focal point of Scandinavian American and German American culture. 

In late decades, migration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America has widened its statistic and social structure. The state's economy has intensely broadened, moving from conventional exercises, for example, farming and asset extraction to administrations and account. Minnesota's way of life list is among the most elevated in the United States, and the state is additionally among the best-taught and wealthiest in the country. 

"Minnesota" originates from the Dakota name for the Minnesota River: The stream got its name from one of two words in the Dakota language, 'MnÃ­ sÃ³ta' which signifies "clear blue water", or 'MniÃota', which implies shady water. Local Americans exhibited the name to early pilgrims by dropping milk into water and calling it "mnisota". Numerous spots in the state have comparative names, for example, Minnehaha Falls ("twisting water" or cascade), Minneiska ("white water"), Minneota ("much water"), Minnetonka ("enormous water"), Minnetrista ("abnormal water"), and Minneapolis, a mix of "mni" and "polis", the Greek word for "city". 

Minnesota is the second northernmost U.S. state (after Alaska) and northernmost touching state. Its confined Northwest Angle in Lake of the Woods province is the main piece of the 48 touching states lying north of the 49th parallel. The state is a piece of the U.S. district known as the Upper Midwest and part of North America's Great Lakes Region. It shares a Lake Superior water outskirt with Michigan and a land and water fringe with Wisconsin toward the east. Iowa is toward the south, North Dakota and South Dakota are toward the west, and the Canadian territories of Ontario and Manitoba are toward the north. With , or around 2.25% of the United States, Minnesota is the twelfth biggest state. 

Minnesota has a portion of the world's most established rocks, gneisses that are about 3.6 billion years of age (80% as old as the planet). About 2.7 billion years prior, basaltic magma spilled out of breaks in the floor of the primordial sea; the remaining parts of this volcanic shake framed the Canadian Shield in upper east Minnesota. The foundations of these volcanic mountains and the activity of Precambrian oceans shaped the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a time of volcanism 1.1 billion years prior, Minnesota's land movement has been increasingly stifled, with no volcanism or mountain development, however with rehashed attacks of the ocean, which abandoned different strata of sedimentary shake. 

In later occasions, huge ice sheets somewhere around one kilometer thick assaulted the state's scene and shaped its territory. The Wisconsin glaciation left 12,000 years prior. These ice sheets secured all of Minnesota aside from the far southeast, a region described by soak slopes and streams that cut into the bedrock. This territory is known as the Driftless Zone for its nonattendance of chilly float. A significant part of the rest of the state outside the upper east has 50Â feet (15Â m) or a greater amount of cold till left behind as the last ice sheets withdrew. Huge Lake Agassiz framed in the northwest 13,000 years prior. Its bed made the fruitful Red River valley, and its surge, frigid River Warren, cut the valley of the Minnesota River and the Upper Mississippi downstream from Fort Snelling. Minnesota is geographically calm today; it encounters seismic tremors rarely, and the vast majority of them are minor. 

The state's high point is Eagle Mountain at 2,301Â feet (701Â m), which is just far from the low of 601Â feet (183Â m) at the shore of Lake Superior. Despite emotional nearby contrasts in height, a great part of the state is a tenderly moving peneplain. 

Two noteworthy seepage isolates meet in Minnesota's upper east in rustic Hibbing, framing a triple watershed. Precipitation can pursue the Mississippi River south to the Gulf of Mexico, the Saint Lawrence Seaway east to the Atlantic Ocean, or the Hudson Bay watershed to the Arctic Ocean. 

The state's epithet, "Place that is known for 10,000 Lakes", is able, as there are 11,842 Minnesota lakes over in size. Minnesota's segment of Lake Superior is the biggest at and most profound (at ) waterway in the state. Minnesota has 6,564 common waterways and streams that aggregately stream for . The Mississippi River starts its adventure from its headwaters at Lake Itasca and crosses the Iowa outskirt downstream. It is joined by the Minnesota River at Fort Snelling, by the St. Croix River close Hastings, by the Chippewa River at Wabasha, and by numerous littler streams. The Red River, in the bed of chilly Lake Agassiz, depletes the northwest piece of the state northward toward Canada's Hudson Bay. Around of wetlands are inside Minnesota's fringes, the a large portion of any state with the exception of Alaska. 

Minnesota has four environmental territories: Prairie Parkland, in the southwestern and western pieces of the express; the Eastern Broadleaf Forest (Big Woods) in the southeast, stretching out in a narrowing strip to the state's northwestern part, where it changes into Tallgrass Aspen Parkland; and the northern Laurentian Mixed Forest, a transitional backwoods between the northern boreal woodland and the broadleaf timberlands toward the south. These northern woodlands are an immense wild of pine and spruce trees blended with inconsistent stands of birch and poplar. 

Quite a bit of Minnesota's northern woods experienced logging sooner or later, leaving just a couple of patches of old development woodland today in regions, for example, in the Chippewa National Forest and the Superior National Forest, where the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness has some of unlogged land. In spite of the fact that logging proceeds, regrowth and replanting keep around 33% of the state forested. About the majority of Minnesota's prairies and oak savannas have been divided by cultivating, brushing, logging, and rural improvement. 

While loss of living space has influenced local creatures, for example, the pine marten, elk, forest caribou, and buffalo, others like whitetail deer and catamount flourish. The state has the country's biggest populace of timber wolves outside Alaska, and supports solid populaces of mountain bears, moose, and gophers. Situated on the Mississippi Flyway, Minnesota has transitory waterfowl, for example, geese and ducks, and diversion fowls, for example, grouse, birds, and turkeys. It is home to winged creatures of prey, including the biggest number of rearing sets of bald eagles in the lower 48 states, starting at 2007, red-followed birds of prey, and frigid owls. The lakes abound with game fish, for example, walleye, bass, muskellunge, and northern pike, and streams in the southeast and upper east are populated by rivulet, dark colored, and rainbow trout. 

Minnesota encounters temperature limits normal for its mainland atmosphere, with virus winters and sweltering summers.

Today, Minnesota has 72 state parks and amusement regions, 58 state backwoods covering around four million sections of land (16,000Â kmÂ²), and various state untamed life protects, all overseen by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. There are in the Chippewa and Superior national timberlands. The Superior National Forest in the upper east contains the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, which incorporates over a million sections of land (4,000Â kmÂ²) and a thousand lakes. To its west is Voyageurs National Park. The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area (MNRRA), is a hallway along the Mississippi River through the Minneapolisâ St. Paul Metropolitan Area interfacing an assortment of locales of notable, social, and geologic intrigue. 

Prior to European settlement of North America, Minnesota was populated by a subculture of Sioux called the Dakota individuals. As Europeans settled the east coast, Native Americans moved far from them causing relocation of the Anishinaabe (otherwise called Ojibwe) and other Native Americans into the Minnesota zone. The primary Europeans in the territory were French voyageur hide merchants who landed in the seventeenth century and started utilizing the Grand Portage to get to catching and exchanging territories further inland. Late that century, Anishinaabe relocated westbound to Minnesota, causing strains with the Dakota individuals. Adventurers, for example, Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, Father Louis Hennepin, Jonathan Carver, Henry Schoolcraft, and Joseph Nicollet mapped out the state. 

In 1762 the locale turned out to be a piece of Spanish Louisiana until 1802. The segment of the state east of the Mississippi River turned out to be a piece of the United States toward the finish of the American Revolutionary War, when the Second Treaty of Paris was agreed upon. Land west of the Mississippi River was procured with the Louisiana Purchase, despite the fact that a part of the Red River Valley was questioned until the Treaty of 1818. By the late 1700s, the North West Company had built up the post of Fort Charlotte at the Lake Superior end of the Grand Portage, until moving 50 miles upper east to Fort William in 1803. In 1805, Zebulon Pike haggled with Native Americans to secure land at the conversion of the Minnesota and Mississippi waterways. The development of Fort Snelling pursued somewhere in the range of 1819 and 1825. Its warriors assembled a grist plant and a sawmill at Saint Anthony Falls, the first of the water-fueled ventures around which the city of Minneapolis later developed. In the mean time, squatters, government authorities, and vacationers had settled close to the fortress. In 1839, the military constrained them to move downriver and they settled in the region that progressed toward becoming St. Paul. Minnesota Territory was shaped on March 3, 1849. The main regional lawmaking body (held September 2, 1849) was overwhelmed by men from New England or of New England parentage. A great many individuals had come to assemble ranches and cut timber, and Minnesota turned into the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858. The establishing populace was so overwhelmingly of New England causes that the state was named "the New England of the West". 

Arrangements between European pilgrims and the Dakota and Ojibwe slowly constrained the locals off their territories and on to littler reservations. In 1861, occupants of Mankato shaped the Knights of the Forest, with an objective of wiping out all Indians from Minnesota. As conditions disintegrated for the Dakota, pressures rose, prompting the Dakota War of 1862. The aftereffect of the six-week war was the execution of 38 Dakota and the outcast of the greater part of the remainder of the Dakota to the Crow Creek Reservation in Dakota Territory. Upwards of 800 white pilgrims passed on amid the war. 

Logging and cultivating were backbones of Minnesota's initial economy. The sawmills at Saint Anthony Falls, and logging focuses like Pine City, Marine on St. Croix, Stillwater, and Winona, prepared high volumes of wood. These urban communities were arranged on streams that were perfect for transportation. Afterward, Saint Anthony Falls was tapped to give capacity to flour plants. Advancements by Minneapolis mill operators prompted the creation of Minnesota "patent" flour, which instructed practically twofold the cost of "cooks'" or "clear" flour, which it supplanted. By 1900, Minnesota factories, driven by Pillsbury, Northwestern and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a precursor of General Mills), were crushing 14.1 percent of the country's grain. 

The state's iron-mining industry was set up with the disclosure of iron in the Vermilion Range and the Mesabi Range during the 1880s, and in the Cuyuna Range in the mid twentieth century. The mineral was delivered by rail to Duluth and Two Harbors, at that point stacked onto dispatches and transported eastbound over the Great Lakes. 

Mechanical advancement and the ascent of assembling made the populace move bit by bit from provincial regions to urban areas amid the mid twentieth century. In any case, cultivating stayed common. Minnesota's economy was hard-hit by the Great Depression, bringing about lower costs for ranchers, cutbacks among iron diggers, and work distress. Aggravating the misfortune, western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by dry spell from 1931 to 1935. New Deal programs gave some monetary turnaround. The Civilian Conservation Corps and different projects around the state built up certain occupations for Indians on their reservations, and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 gave the clans an instrument of self-government. This gave locals a more noteworthy voice inside the state, and advanced more regard for ancestral traditions since religious services and local dialects were never again smothered. 

After World War II, modern improvement enlivened. New innovation expanded ranch profitability through mechanization of feedlots for pigs and cows, machine draining at dairy homesteads, and bringing chickens up in extensive structures. Planting turned out to be progressively specific with hybridization of corn and wheat, and the utilization of homestead apparatus, for example, tractors and consolidates turned into the standard. College of Minnesota teacher Norman Borlaug added to these advancements as a component of the Green Revolution. Rural improvement quickened because of expanded after war lodging request and advantageous transportation. Expanded versatility, thus, empowered increasingly concentrated occupations. 

Minnesota turned into a focal point of innovation after World War II. Designing Research Associates was shaped in 1946 to create PCs for the United States Navy. It later converged with Remington Rand, and after that progressed toward becoming Sperry Rand. William Norris left Sperry in 1957 to shape Control Data Corporation (CDC). Cray Research was shaped when Seymour Cray left CDC to frame his own organization. Therapeutic gadget producer Medtronic likewise begun business in the Twin Cities in 1949.
