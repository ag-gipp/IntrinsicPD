Most inclusion was negative and would in general give a view of another danger to the steadiness of the Western world.

A media bazaar resulted, with Smith being met by Ted Koppel and Johnny Carson, among others, and with daily reports by the significant American systems.

In Artek, Smith remained with the Soviet youngsters as opposed to acknowledge the favored lodging offered to her.

The report proceeds to state, "The moderately steep flight way edge and the disposition (the introduction of the flying machine with respect to the skyline, heading of movement and so forth.) and speed of the plane at ground sway blocked the tenants from enduring the mishap." The primary concern of the report was that it was a stormy night, that the pilots working the flying machine were unpracticed, and an unplanned, yet normal and not typically basic, ground radar disappointment happened. 

Samantha Smith was grieved by around 1,000 individuals at her burial service in Augusta, Maine, and was lauded in Moscow as a hero of harmony. Participants included Robert Wagner and Vladimir Kulagin of the Soviet Embassy in Washington, who read an individual message of sympathy from Mikhail Gorbachev.
