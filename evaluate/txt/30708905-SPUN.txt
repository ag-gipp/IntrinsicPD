Satellite Science Fiction 

Satellite Science Fiction was an American sci-fi magazine, distributed from October 1956 to April 1959 by Leo Margulies' Renown Publications. At first "Satellite" was digest-sized, and ran a full-length novel in each issue, with a bunch of short stories going with it: the strategy was proposed to enable it to go up against soft cover books, which were taking a developing offer of the market. Sam Merwin altered the initial two issues; Margulies took over when Merwin left, and after that procured Frank Belknap Long for the February 1959 issue. That issue saw the organization change to letter-measure, with the expectation that the magazine would be increasingly noticeable on newspaper kiosks. The analysis was a disappointment, and Margulies shut the magazine when the business figures came in. 

The books incorporated the first form of Philip K. Dick's first novel, "The Cosmic Puppets", and generally welcomed work by Algis Budrys and Jack Vance, however the quality was not in every case high. Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and L. Sprague de Camp were among the short story patrons. Sam Moskowitz composed a progression of articles on the early history of sci-fi for "Satellite"; these were later to be reconsidered as a feature of his book "Voyagers of the Infinite". In 1958 Margulies found the main magazine distribution of H.G. Wells' "The Time Machine" from 1894â 1895, and republished a short extract from it that had been excluded by each consequent printing. 

In 1952, Leo Margulies and H. Lawrence Herbert established King-Size Publications, which distributed "Holy person Detective Magazine" and "Fabulous Universe". By 1956 the organization was paying off debtors, and Margulies sold a lot of the organization to Herbert. With the cash from the deal he established Renown Publications, propelling "Michael Shayne Mystery Magazine" in September 1956, and the primary issue of "Satellite Science Fiction" in October. "Satellite's" wholesaler, PDC, was controlled by old companions of Margulies. The magazine started as an every other month, however Margulies would have liked to make it month to month in the long run. The primary manager was Sam Merwin, whom Margulies had worked with since the 1930s. Margulies likewise would have liked to dispatch a book engrave, Renown Books, with the objective of issuing four books per month. One title every month would be sci-fi, and would be highlighted in "Satellite" before it showed up in book structure. 

Merwin left after two issues and Margulies took over as manager with the February 1957 issue. While trying to make "Satellite" progressively unmistakable on the newspaper kiosks, Margulies changed the arrangement from summary size to letter-estimate with the February 1959 issue, giving over the editorship to Frank Belknap Long in the meantime, and changing to a month to month plan. This turned out to be an error. The creation costs for the new arrangement were higher, and the business figures for the principal issue in the new configuration were frail; when Margulies saw the numbers he quickly shut down the magazine. The June 1959 issue was amassed, however never printed, however a couple of kitchen proofs advanced under the control of gatherers. The finish of the magazine additionally implied the finish of Margulies' arrangements for Renown Books. 

Soft cover books were a developing offer of the sci-fi (sf) advertise in the mid-1950s; they were fruitful somewhat in light of the fact that they offered books, which most perusers wanted to short stories. Margulies chose to battle the danger from soft cover books by incorporating a novel in each issue of the magazine. This was a technique that had been utilized by mash sf magazines like "Surprising Stories", for which Margulies had been publication chief. It was not normal in condensation magazines, where a story as short as 15,000 words may be recorded as a novel on the substance page, however Margulies procured genuine novel-length works, with a normal length of around 40,000 words, for "Satellite". Margulies utilized the trademark "The Magazine That Is a Book!" in notices for the magazine, and the slogan "A Complete Science Fiction Novel in Every Issue!" showed up on a significant number of the spreads. 

The initial two issues highlighted Algis Budrys' tale "The Man From Earth", and Philip K. Dick's introduction novel, under the title "A Glass of Darkness". Both were changed and showed up as soft cover books in the following couple of years, titled "Man of Earth" and "The Cosmic Puppets", separately. The elevated expectation of these two issues couldn't be kept up, and in the supposition of sf history specialists Malcolm Edwards and Mike Ashley the magazine's quality declined from that point. Hal Clement's "Planet for Plunder", which showed up in the third issue, was told from the perspective of an outsider set for Earth. It was too short to even think about fitting Margulies' arrangement of distributing a lead novel, so Merwin composed extra parts from the human viewpoint, and substituted the two points of view in the distributed form. Ashley talks exceedingly of Clement's unique novella, which was in the long run distributed without the augmentations in 1972, and remarks that Merwin's increments fill in as "an item exercise in how to destroy a decent story". Edwards and Ashley single out two different books as deserving of notice: J.T. McIntosh's "One Million Cities" (in the August 1958 issue), and Jack Vance's "The Languages of Pao" (December 1957), portrayed by sf faultfinders Peter Nicholls and David Langford as "a standout amongst the most clever uses in sort sf" of the Whorf speculation â the hypothesis that the language one talks decides one's impression of the real world. Plain Belknap Long's epic "Mission to a Distant Star" (February1958) was at one point considered for distribution as the main novel in the arranged Renown Books line. 

The books in the initial five issues were all unique, however in August 1957 the lead novel was a reproduce: John Christopher's "The Year of the Comet", which had been distributed in the UK in 1955, yet had not yet showed up in the US. More reprints pursued, including Charles Eric Maine's "Mass of Fire", E.C. Tubb's "The Resurrected Man", and Noel Loomis' "The Man With Absolute Motion". Each had been distributed in the past couple of years in the UK, yet not in the US. 

Since the word mean the entire magazine was just around 53,000 words, there was little space for different stories or for genuine highlights, and thus the going with stories were generally short articles of a thought or joke; in Michael Shaara's "Four-Billion Dollar Door", the principal kept an eye on outing to the moon lands effectively yet finds that the entryway has solidified closed and can't be opened. Arthur C. Clarke and Dal Stevens were visit benefactors of short fiction, and there were appearances by other understood scholars, for example, Isaac Asimov and L. Sprague de Camp. Margulies knew that two or three pages of H.G. Wells' 1895 novel "The Time Machine" had been overlooked from each printing of the novel since its unique serialization in 1894â 1895 in "The New Review", so he paid for a library look and was remunerated by the disclosure of the magazine containing the missing pages in the New York Public Library, over the road from his office. The precluded material, which managed a far future where people have deteriorated to little, rabbit-like animals, was republished in the August 1958 issue. 

Sam Moskowitz started a book survey segment in February 1957 that immediately transformed into a progression of articles about early sci-fi, starting with "The Real Earth Satellite Story" in the June 1957 issue, about satellites in early sf. Moskowitz likewise proposed stories that could be reproduced to enhance the articles, for example, Fitz-James O'Brien's 1864 short story "How I Overcame My Gravity", which went with the paper on O'Brien in the June 1958 issue. The greater part of these articles were later amended for his book, "Pilgrims of the Infinite", however the delineations, which repeated early craftsmanship or book covers, were excluded for the book variant. Margulies composed an article for each issue with the exception of the last one. In the April 1959 issue his article contended that a letter segment was an approach to "[strengthen] the bond among authors and perusers"; he as needs be presented a letter section in the May 1959 issue, which turned out to be the last. "Satellite's" work of art was unremarkable, in the assessment of Mike Ashley; he singles out Alex Schomburg's about six spreads for acclaim, yet portrays the inside craftsmanship, quite a bit of it by Leo Morey, as "average". 

At the point when the arrangement changed, toward the beginning of 1959, Margulies dropped the strategy of having a full-length novel in each issue. He included a "Division of Lost Stories", which reproduced old stories, chosen by peruser's solicitations; the first to be republished was Ralph Milne Farley's 1932 short story "Abductor Minimi Digit", mentioned by Theodore Sturgeon. The June 1959 issue, which was never conveyed, would have contained Sturgeon's "The Strange Birth", which in the end showed up in the May 1960 issue of "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction", under the title "Open to Me, My Sister". A mockup of the spread for the July 1959 has endure, appearing of the arranged substance; the two unpublished issues would have contained stories and articles by Arthur C. Clarke, A.E. van Vogt, and Frank Herbert, among others. The vast majority of the tales and articles were in the long run distributed somewhere else. 

"Satellite" was digest-sized for the initial fourteen issues, and changed over to letter-estimate for the last four. It kept up a normal every other month plan until the change to letter estimate, so, all in all it turned out to be month to month. There were three volumes of six numbers each. The condensation issues were each 128 pages, and the letter-sized issues were 64 pages. The cost was 35 pennies all through. Sam Merwin altered the initial two issues; he was prevailing by Leo Margulies for the remainder of the summary run. Forthcoming Belknap Long took over as proofreader for the four letter-sized issues. Margulies' significant other, Cylvia, was overseeing proofreader for all issues, under her family name, Cylvia Kleinman. The distributer for all issues was Renown Publications, which was completely possessed by Leo Margulies.
