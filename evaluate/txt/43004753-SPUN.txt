"Opportunity Planet" is a 2D stage and activity amusement including humanized creature characters and 16-bit style illustrations copying the appearance of diversions discharged for the Sega Genesis, especially the "Sonic the Hedgehog" arrangement. The diversion places players in the job of one of the accessible playable characters as they navigate each dimension, battling adversaries and impediments before confronting a supervisor toward the end.

The amusement starts as Sash Lilac and Carol Teaâa human monster and wildcat â salvage a duck-charged animal named Torque after his rocket crash lands. At Torque's solicitation, the three set out to secure a ground-breaking relic called the Kingdom Stone. This includes them in a contention between three countries on their planet: Shuigang, a nation mobilized by its new lord, Dail; Shang Mu, driven by the riches fixated Mayor Zao ( or ); and Shang Tu, whose Royal Magister is not ready for war. Lilac and Carol race to the Kingdom Stone's hallowed place yet are waylaid by the Shang Tu officers General Gong and Neera Li, who question that the Stone is undermined. The heroes arrive similarly as the Stone is stolen by Spade, a partner in crime of Zao. After the altar breakdown, Carol is isolated from Lilac and stuck by rubble, yet she is spared by the hesitant basset dog Milla () Basset. 

That night, Torque tells Lilac, Carol, and Milla that he is an outsider sent to catch the intergalactic warlord Arktivus Brevon, whose shuttle destroyed on the planet. Brevon has attacked Shuigang, killed its ruler, and mentally programmed Dail to be his hireling. He expects to take the Stone to control his ship. The heroes choose to recover the Stone from Zao, yet they are greeted on the way by Spade and by Brevon's associate Serpentine. The defers give Dail and Brevon's powers time to take the relic. Thereafter, Zao sends the heroes as emissaries to Shang Tu to talk about a coalition against Shuigang. They are confined by the Magister upon their entry, as Neera reprimands them for the Stone's unique vanishing. Torque is cleared when Lilac erroneously concedes. She, Carol, and Milla rapidly break out of prison to rejoin with Torque, just to see him caught by Brevon and Serpentine. 

Song squabbles with Lilac and tempests off. Lilac sends Milla to discover her and afterward goes to spare Torque from Brevon's close-by base, yet she is caught and tormented by Brevon. In the mean time, Carol and Milla partner with Spade to storm the base, where they salvage Torque and Lilac. They are altogether isolated in the resulting strife. Neera discovers Lilac, captures her, and takes her back to Shang Tu, where the Magister verifies that she is guiltless and uncovers that Zao is testing Shuigang for the Stone. Lilac rejoins her companions and persuades Shang Mu and Shang Tu to join against Dail and Brevon's military. Amid the fight, Brevon reports that his ship is fixed, and Lilac, Milla, and Carol board it. The group battles Brevon's followers, including a transformed Serpentine. Brevon catches Milla and transforms her into an unusual beast that assaults different heroes, who are compelled to render her oblivious. Goaded, Lilac and Carol assault and annihilation Brevon, yet the Kingdom Stone is devastated all the while. Soon after the fight, Milla stirs in a restorative tent and sees the sky lit up by whirling, crystalline vitality discharged from the Kingdom Stone. The three kingdoms resolve to saddle the Stone's capacity and offer it similarly, in this way finishing the war. Torque bids a fond farewell to Lilac, Carol, and Milla and comes back to space. 

"Opportunity Planet" was considered in late 2011 by American amusement creator and software engineer Stephen DiDuro, who had quite recently established the free improvement studio GalaxyTrail Games. In spite of the fact that it is a unique licensed innovation, "Opportunity Planet" was first created as a "Sonic" fangame: it contained rings, and Doctor Eggman was the miscreant. DiDuro chose that the "Sonic" connection would keep down the amusement and endeavored without progress to plan his own characters. Thereafter, he got consent from the Chinese craftsman Ziyo Lingâwhom he had found on the workmanship site DeviantArtâto utilize her character Sash Lilac, and later, Carol and Milla in his diversion. The soundtrack was made by DiDuro as a team with Shane "Blue Warrior" Ellis and client Leila "Woofle" Wilson. 

At an opportune time, DiDuro got urged to isolate it further from "Sonic", so he supplanted rings with red leaves and adjusted the characters' capacities. Ziyo had drawn Lilac as a hedgehog, yet DiDuro upgraded the character to be a monster. Lilac's divider ricocheting depended on a comparative diversion specialist from "Ristar". Initially, her dimension of vitality was to be reliant on her speed, however this demonstrated too hard to even think about controlling. 

While "Opportunity Planet" was created in Denmark and the United States, its specialty bearing was affected by medieval East Asian workmanship, especially that of China. The amusement's visuals reference present day sci-fi and dream also. A great part of the content in the amusement world is written in Chinese characters, and the title content is subtitled in Japanese katakana as , however the diversion initially did not bolster the Japanese language. 

"Opportunity Planet" was first discharged as a demo for Microsoft Windows in August 2012. After a full form of the diversion was supported through Kickstarter, it was taken to Steam Greenlight and affirmed for Steam. Its discharge was first anticipated for mid 2014, at that point deferred to June 30. Quickly before that date, it was deferred again to July 19: the designers needed to advance the diversion at a tradition in Miami, Florida, and to keep away from rivalry from the vigorously limited items in Steam's Summer Sale. The diversion was discharged, after a third deferral, on July 21. To promote the diversion, GalaxyTrail made marked T-shirts, and Lilac was incorporated as an easter egg in the 2013 amusement "". DiDuro considered and dismissed building up an Android rendition of "Opportunity Planet", yet he is setting aside some cash to port the diversion to the PlayStation Vita. The amusement was discharged on the site GOG.com in late 2014. GalaxyTrail additionally created adaptations for Mac OS X and Linux, which were discharged on Steam on April 17, 2015. 

On March 9, 2015, Stephen DiDuro declared through Twitter that a form of the amusement for Nintendo's Wii U support was made arrangements for discharge on the eShop online store for late 2015, later indicated as August 13. A demo was discharged as a major aspect of an advancement titled "Nindies@home", wherein players were welcome to attempt a few up and coming Wii U amusements between June 15 and 22. On July 28, GalaxyTrail affirmed that generation of the last form of the diversion was taking longer than anticipated, recommending that the amusement's discharge would be later. DiDuro reported the reason for the deferral on August 18: the Wii U form had been set back by a "reassure solidifying bug", which would delay the Wii U discharge inconclusively until the issue was fixed. He later clarified that the bug had taken such a long time to identify on the grounds that it just happened in retail forms of the comfort, which had kept GalaxyTrail and Nintendo from learning of the issue. The bug required a hard reset of the framework to address the issue, which could conceivably make harm the Wii U equipment. The bug was in the long run fixed, and the amusement was effectively discharged on the eShop on October 1; clients who had attempted the diversion's demo were remunerated with a 15-percent markdown. 

In November 2015, GalaxyTrail united with the membership box organization IndieBox circulate a selective physical arrival of "Opportunity Planet". This constrained gatherer's version box incorporated a blaze drive with a without drm amusement document, the official two-circle soundtrack, a guidance manual and Steam key, alongside different specially crafted collectibles. 

Downloadable substance (DLC) was made for the amusement. The principal packs, which include Torque as a playable character and an undertaking story for Milla, was discharged for PCs in December 2015. An extra update to make Spade a playable character, was gotten ready for discharge in 2016 however has been deferred. A variant for the Nintendo Switch was discharged by Xseed Games on August 30, 2018. 

Tony Ponce of Destructoid responded decidedly about the demo for "Opportunity Planet"; and remarked that it was "pleasant to see an entrenched style or recipe connected to another world with unique characters". Essentially, Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef portrayed the diversion's review as "an outside the box "Sonic"- esque platformer done right", and appreciated the updated wellbeing framework. Dominic Tarison of IndieStatik complimented the diversion's "new and new design" of components from exemplary 16-bit amusements, yet scrutinized the measure of distinguishable ongoing interaction zone. John Polson of IndieGames.com trusted that "the scenes like circles and divider runs ... [are not] as supernatural to do or watch" as in "Sonic" recreations, however he urged platformer fans to download the demo. 

Nathan Grayson of Kotaku adulated the demo for its equalization of Genesis "Sonic" components and unique substance: he depicted the item as "an adoration letter to exemplary "Sonic", aside from when it's most certainly not". He commended the diversion's adversaries, yet experienced minor control issues. Pacing was commented to be slower than that of the Genesis "Sonic" amusements due to the additional battle groupings, however Grayson felt this gave the player time to investigate and value the dimension structure. Grayson was incredulous of the voice acting. Ponce unequivocally lauded the visuals, however reprimanded the insipid frontal area plan. Polson noted minor sound and visual imperfections, most strikingly the reusing of audio cues from Genesis "Sonic" recreations, however he commended the diversion's music. Tarison applauded the music and visuals, just as the differed plans of the situations and playable characters. 

Assessing the full form, Jahanzeb Khan of "No-nonsense Gamer" felt that it was a commendable successor to the 1994 diversion "Sonic 3 and Knuckles"â which he thought about the arrangement's zenithâand that it was "maybe the most "Sonic" amusement to have turned out since 1994, one that feels like a genuine advancement and all the more significantly a resonating advance forward." Jonatan Allin of the Danish variant of Eurogamer, who had not appreciated any "Sonic" recreations since the Genesis period, agreed with Khan. Polygon's Griffin McElroy contended that "Opportunity Planet" effectively plays out "a troublesome exercise in careful control, getting and changing components from recreations like "Sonic the Hedgehog" and "Rocket Knight Adventures" without putting on a show of being subsidiary". McElroy and Pablo Taboada of the Spanish-language site MeriStation both contrasted the diversion with crafted by engineer Treasure. Taboada regretted the diversion's indefinite quality and proposed that, had Treasure gotten the rights to "Sonic" and discharged "Opportunity Planet" as an official spin-off, it would have been progressively famous. 

Khan remarked that the dimensions "never feel like they're over too early nor do they delay superfluously", and he valued the setpiece minutes, for example, "hazardous pursue/escape successions, labyrinth like mazes, traps, and even shoot-them up style shooting portions". Taboada was blended on the diversion's quickness: he thought it was appropriate for speedrunning yet uninspiring for those looking for a more profound encounter. On the other hand, Japanese site 4Gamer expressed that the amusement's peculiarities enabled one to play broadly without weariness, and Taboada delighted in the vast, Metroidvania-style levels. 

With respect to diversion's visuals, Taboada stated, "TÃ©cnicamente es excelso" (actually, it is astounding). He lauded the vivid and point by point foundations, expressive character livelinesss, audio effects, and music. Khan concurred: he remarked that "every last trace of it exud[es] imaginative assorted variety with high goals sprites that take after the nature of days gone by". He considered the sound a "decent blend of snappy chiptune style tunes with irresistible engineered beats". Both Khan and 4Gamer were captivated by the diversion's East Asian visual style. Taboada trusted that each character was affable and intriguing to play. Allin ended up startlingly dazzled by the story, which he speculated numerous players would miss because of restlessness with cutscenes. 

On December 25, 2015, GalaxyTrail reported "Opportunity Planet 2" was being developed. As opposed to the first title, it is being manufactured utilizing the Unity system and has higher pixel workmanship goals than its ancestor. With the objective of "defin[ing] "Opportunity Planet"s way of life as an establishment", all characters from the amusement got a structure update by Tyson Tan. While the early idea craftsmanships on the diversion's authentic site stay unaltered, Tyson had been exploring different avenues regarding the new workmanship style with the fans. Christian Whitehead, who lead the improvement on "Sonic Mania", will be included with advancement as he will help DiDuro with writing computer programs, being in charge of porting over the material science from Clickteam Fusion over to Unity's motor.
