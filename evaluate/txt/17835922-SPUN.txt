The city of Chicago manufactured the middle at the crossing point of East Randolph Street and Columbus Drive, and opened it July 2004.

This arrangement (presently supplanted by the "Bicycle 2015 Plan") included arrangements for front-mounted two-bicycle transporters on Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) transports, allowing bicycles to be carried on Chicago 'L' trains, introducing various bicycle racks and making bike paths in avenues all through the city. Also, the Chicago metropolitan zone's different mass travel suppliers, Metra and Pace, have created expanded bicycle openness. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley was a backer of the arrangement, taking note of it is additionally an earth well disposed exertion to eliminate traffic. McDonald's dubiously guaranteed that, since it is giving a more advantageous menu and cultivating grade school physical instruction with an end goal to enable its clients to improve their wellbeing, supporting bike and exercise action in the recreation center enlarges the organization's different activities. 

Earthy people, urban organizers and cycling aficionados around the globe have communicated enthusiasm for the Cycle Center, and need to copy what they see as an example of overcoming adversity in urban arranging and travel situated advancement. Master cycling and tree hugger columnists in productions well past the Chicago metropolitan region have depicted the Cycle Center as praiseworthy, amazing, one of a kind and earth shattering. 

Lying between Lake Michigan toward the east and the Loop toward the west, Grant Park has been Chicago's "front yard" since the mid-nineteenth century. Its northwest corner, north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute, east of Michigan Avenue, south of Randolph Street, and west of Columbus Drive, had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking garages until 1997, when it was made accessible for advancement by the city as Millennium Park. As indicated by 2007 information discharged in 2008, Millennium Park trailed just Navy Pier as a Chicago vacation destination. 

The Millennium Park bike focus was structured by David Steele of the building firm Muller and Muller, which won a $120,000 contract to plan the station by Memorial Day 2004, and initiated the plan in August 2003. This was when bicycle stations were set up or being arranged in a few U.S. urban areas, for example, Denver, and, in California, Los Angeles, Berkeley, Long Beach and Palo Alto. Created at the season of "Bicycle 2010 Plan" dialogs, the station was a piece of Mayor Daley's vision of Chicago as the most bike inviting city in the United States. From the start the arrangement was to have separate administrators for the Cycle Center's rental and fix administrations, just as its espresso and juice bar. 

The bicycle station had initially been wanted to possess and cost $2Â million, yet when finished, the Cycle Center was and situated on a bigger outside court. The last two-story configuration cost $3.2Â million, and a government concede from the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration for activities that decrease traffic blockage and improve air quality financed its development.

Despite the fact that bike focuses were at that point basic all through Europe, Long Beach, California is credited with spearheading suburbanite biking center points offering valet stopping, showers and fix benefits in the United States. As the idea developed, open offices and private gatherings in different urban areas stuck to this same pattern. The advancement of the Millennium Park Cycle Center was a piece of an inversion of bicycle disincentives coming from "Boub v. Township of Wayne"â a 1998 Illinois Supreme Court deciding that bicycles are "allowed" however not "planned" clients of the streets, implying that neighborhood governments have a constrained duty to keep cyclists safe and that regions are safe from bike damage claims except if the road has been obviously set apart as a bicycle course. The city has been effectively pleasing cyclists since 1999 through the CDOT Bike Lane Project. At the season of the July 2004 Cycle Center opening, Illinois Senate Bill 275, which would have expelled the obligation disincentive to include bicycle paths, mark bicycle courses and give cyclists sensible assurance, was at issue. At the time, the city of Chicago had of bicycle paths (with an extra expected), more than 9,000 bicycle racks, and it had actualized an approach permitting bikes on CTA trains (consistently barring weekday morning and evening surge hours), CTA transports and Pace transports. In June 2005, Metra permitted a predetermined number of bikes on trains amid off-pinnacle and end of the week hours out of the blue on a preliminary premise. By 2006, the city had of bicycle paths. The arranging accentuation in Chicago utilizes what is known as travel situated advancement, which urges designers to incorporate bike stopping. 

The structure was initially named the Millennium Park Bike Station, yet in June 2006 McDonald's declared a $5Â million allow to guarantee the tasks of the Cycle Center for 50Â years. The bicycle office had been the last unsponsored part of Millennium Park. As a feature of the enrichment, McDonald's consented to be the supporter of free summer physical work out schedules, for example, yoga, pilates, and an assortment of move class sessions in Millennium Park for 10Â years. McDonald's made a deal to avoid utilizing any of its conventional business signage, for example, the Golden Arches.

When it opened in 2006 the bicycle station was one of the nation's biggest and generally present day. The Cycle Center's bike stopping offices utilize high-limit, two-layered DoubleParker racks that oblige more than twice the same number of bikes per square foot as customary bicycle racks.

Long-lasting author for the "Chicago Tribune" and current Tribune wellbeing and wellness columnist, Julie Deardorff, portrayed the move as a continuation of the '"McDonaldization" of America' and as to some degree "guileful" in light of the fact that the organization is making itself progressively conspicuous as the social supposition is to move far from cheap food.
