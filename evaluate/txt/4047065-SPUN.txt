The western end of the zone (around Nempnett Thrubwell) comprises of the Harptree Beds which join silicified mud, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which incorporates Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous time frame, is found in the bordering focal band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic time frame. There are two primary soil types, both for the most part very much depleted. The mudstones around the lakes offer ascent to prolific silty mud soils that are a dull dim red shading on account of their high iron substance. The mud content implies that where unchanged they effectively turned out to be waterlogged when wet, and hard with splits and crevices amid dry periods. The fundamental topographical outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, to a great extent comprising of red Siltstone bringing about the basic normal for the tenderly moving valley scene.
