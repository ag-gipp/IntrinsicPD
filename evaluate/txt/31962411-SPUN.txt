"Crash 2048" is a dashing diversion which includes players directing repulsive force dispatches through an assortment of situations. Set basically in the year 2048, it is a prequel to the principal portion of the "Crash" arrangement; devoted race tracks have not yet been manufactured, and races are hung on city avenues. The single-player diversion advances through the initial three years, 2048, 2049, and 2050, of the AGRC (Anti-Gravity Racing Championships). The amusement has four sorts of boats: speed ships, readiness boats, contenders and models. Speed ships (lightweight, Formula 1-like vehicles which underline quickening and force) are principally utilized for speed-situated races, for example, time preliminaries.

"Crash 2048" was created by Sony Studio Liverpool, known as Psygnosis amid the advancement of the early "Crash" amusements. Studio Liverpool's specialized executive, Stuart Lovegrove, certified that the diversion was created in parallel with the PlayStation Vita and was a testbed for the reassure. Lovegrove knew that the following "Crash" amusement would be a dispatch title, and said that it was something Studio Liverpool had done previously. Chris Roberts, the diversion's chief of illustrations, devices and advances, said that Sony Computer Entertainment included the Liverpudlian studio right off the bat in the improvement of the PlayStation Vita and had a "genuinely smart thought" of the comfort's capacity. Jon Eggleton, previous senior craftsman of the "Crash" arrangement, said in a meeting that Studio Liverpool affected the Vita's structure. At the point when staff were given advancement packs for what was known as a "cutting edge convenient", a gathering was shaped to conceptualize equipment subtleties; proposition incorporated a touchscreen gadget, not yet brought about by Sony. Eggleton conjectured that the reassure was discharged with two simple sticks exclusively in light of the fact that "Studio Liverpool said it required two sticks". Amid early advancement of "Crash 2048" and the PlayStation Vita, the studio furnished Sony with criticism on the equipment and libraries and sent refreshed application code to Sony's firmware staff for testing their compilers. Both Lovegrove and Roberts were awed with the effortlessness of the Vita's firmware, rather than the design of the PlayStation 3. 

The advancement group perceived the contrasts between making a diversion for the PlayStation Vita and the PlayStation 3. Lovegrove said that planning the diversion for the Vita's littler screen made it simpler to create, mitigating "old issues" with structuring an amusement focused for a HD screen, however the studio needed to guarantee that the diversion could keep running at any goals. Roberts concurred, saying that "it [was] to a lesser extent a cerebral pain for specialists" who needed to change lighting impacts. Gotten some information about significant contrasts between the PlayStation 3's RSX Reality Synthesizer designs handling unit (GPU) and the PlayStation Vita's ARM engineering, Roberts said that the "most self-evident" distinction was the Vita's absence of stream preparing units (SPU). He said that a large portion of "Crash HD" SPU code was coordinated towards GPU support, which included highlights, for example, geometry separating, lighting impacts and rendering. As per Roberts, the Vita's GPU and ARM design were progressively proficient and taken care of "Crash 2048" "great". Lovegrove, who had worked with ARM engineering on the BBC Micro, said that the group did not need to advance anything to achieve their objectives and it was agreeable to see a similar design running the amusement. 

In spite of the fact that "Crash 2048" and "Crash HD" have a mutual shader program and did not require retooling for the Vita's design, Roberts said that a "lot" of time and consideration was spent tweaking the diversion's shader impacts for the Vita's GPU. Lovegrove suspected that the technique for taking a shot at a PlayStation 3 and its handheld partner was indistinguishable (an assumption for the most part shared by the group), and Roberts said that the frameworks' similitudes helped the group "get going rapidly". Roberts included that the diversion's lighting framework was indistinguishable to that of "Crash HD"; the two amusements' boats shared picture based lighting, with mixed diffuse and specular features impacts and the vertex-based lighting framework utilized for weaponry. As indicated by Roberts, the primary distinction between the diversions was PlayStation Vita's use of the impacts through the GPU; PlayStation 3 depended on SPUs. The group chose to utilize hostile to associated shading supports for constant shadow rendering, rather than profundity cradles. This gave the diversion more noteworthy straightforwardness impacts, since the memory cost of against associating was 8 bits for each pixel; along these lines, 4x MSAA (multisample hostile to associating) cradles contained a similar measure of memory as a 32-bit profundity support. Another element which Roberts considered an improvement was tone mapping (mostly because of Vita's prevalent help of support groups), which gave "Crash 2048" better introduction control and sprout impacts. 

To suit the diversion's visual loyalty, the group settled on edge rate. Roberts said that the choice was made from the get-go being developed, since they at first expected that the PlayStation Vita could run PlayStation 3 resources at 30 Hz. The group utilized existing code from "Crash HD" as a "beginning stage" to make the improvement procedure progressively productive; the craftsmanship and specialized groups of Studio Liverpool worked in parallel. Lovegrove concurred that 30 outlines for every second was dependably the objective for the diversion, since the group needed to organize visual quality. In an "Eurogamer" talk with, Roberts said that Studio Liverpool were one of the principal designers to utilize a dynamic framebuffer on the PlayStation 3: a calculation which decreases goals when the amusement motor is pushed, keeping up execution and streamlining outline rate. The strategy, known as goals throttling, was continued from "Crash HD" to "Crash 2048": "On the off chance that you are hell bent on locking outline rate and goals your entire amusement is (graphically) limited by the most dire outcome imaginable". 

"Crash 2048" was discharged as a dispatch title for the PlayStation Vita in mid 2012. In 2010 Sony Computer Entertainment rebuilt Studio Liverpool as a component of a "venture prioritization" of Sony's worldwide resources, and a few of the studio's up and coming tasks were dropped.

FrÃ©dÃ©ric Goyon of Jeuxvideo.com loved the amusement's usage of the PlayStation Vita's OLED screen, in spite of the fact that he saw little contrast between the graphical improvements of "Crash 2048" and "Crash HD". As per Goyon, the diversion was "liquid in all conditions" and was basically "Crash HD" on a littler screen. Heath Hindman of Game Revolution said that despite the fact that it "truly flaunts" the PlayStation Vita's graphical power (alongside "Unfamiliar: Golden Abyss", another dispatch title), the diversion's sight separate was constrained. "Crash 2048" track configuration was to a great extent adulated. Simon Parkin of "The Guardian" making the most of its "entirely contemporary" track subtleties and visual consistency with past portions, and Peter Willington of "Pocket Gamer" called the diversion's track structure the best in the arrangement. As indicated by Sebastian Haley of VentureBeat, "Crash 2048" would have profited by a "somewhat more courageous" track plan. 

Willington noticed that the amusement's visuals experienced associating, and "Crash 2048" was "undermining the point" of "Crash HD" (a PlayStation 3 title).

Paul Furfari of UGO appreciated "Crash 2048" visual style, considering it the main feature for the PlayStation Vita's crude power. He singled out the "Tron"- like visual introduction of the Zone mode and the amusement's commonly strong edge rate. Dale North of Destructoid said that the arrangement reliably displayed the framework on which they were discharged and "Crash 2048" was a decent dispatch title for the PlayStation Vita. North called it a wonderful amusement; "as quick and garish as its ancestors", it "truly awes" on the PlayStation Vita's high-goals screen and the boats and advanced backgrounds appear to "pop ideal off the screen". Sebastian Haley of VentureBeat composed that the diversion sticks to the commonplace, high visual standard set by past "Crash" portions. 

Pundits delighted in the amusement's utilization of the PlayStation Vita's simple control sticks. Jeuxvideo.com's Goyon lauded the diversion's advancement of the Vita's whirligig and touchpad highlights and the incredibly successful simple stick. As indicated by Parkin, the diversion's specialized hindrances made it an expectation to absorb information for the designers; he believed that they didn't plan to decrease the mobility of the PlayStation Vita's simple stick, as opposed to "Crash HD". "Advanced Spy" Mark Langshaw found the PlayStation Vita's simple stick smooth and responsive, in spite of the fact that he scrutinized its availability for players new to the arrangement. He appreciated the diversion's utilization of the reassure's whirligig and touchpad to move and gather catalysts, separately, however said that the touchpad did not have a similar dimension of precision as its physical option. The ongoing interaction by and large was very much respected, including its replay esteem and adjusted trouble. "Amusement Informer" Dan Ryckert considered the diversion's replay esteem moderate; in spite of the fact that its simple stick worked admirably of controlling the boats, it had a recognizable absence of footing. As indicated by Hindman, the diversion would have profited by a customisable control design and the three pre-made default setups were inadmissible. Willington refered to "Crash 2048" as the arrangement's best handheld amusement and applauding its tight controls and assortment of substance. "Edge"s commentator adulated the multiplayer mode, saying that it "increases the value of the bundle" and gave a one of a kind inclination to the Vita's online potential. Shea and Bailey noticed the amusement's decreased casing rate of 30 outlines for every second, a stage down from the establishment's conventional 60 outlines for every second. Gerstmann felt that the casing rate every so often influenced interactivity and speed, yet the amusement was for the most part steady.

Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb noted "Crash 2048" specialized issues, especially its stacking times. IGN's Cam Shea called the 30-second stacking occasions disappointing "when all you need to do is race", and Gameplanet's Adam Goodall likewise depicted the long stacking occasions as dreadful, however he felt they were insufficient to make the diversion a disappointment and guaranteed the general interactivity experience "profoundly fulfilling". GamesRadar's Kathryn Bailey said that the amusement's online mode was top notch, exceptionally available and an "a sound representative for "Crash"."

"The Guardian" Simon Parkin scrutinized the diversion's extended stacking times; a delay no less than twenty seconds too long had a negative impact in the time of "insta-fix portable gaming on the adversary stages". Willington found the long burden times an issue which torment the diversion, "absolutely at chances" with the typical pace of interactivity. Gaston said that the stacking times were "basically reprehensible"; he routinely held up more than 50 seconds in the wake of choosing a race to begin it, which limited the capacity to easily play the amusement "in a hurry". Walton likewise found the long stacking occasions chafing in a handheld amusement, and said that holding up over 40 seconds to begin a race was far longer than it ought to have been.
