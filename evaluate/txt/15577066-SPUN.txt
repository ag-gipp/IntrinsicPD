The Clinton Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons was the second association to use Literary Hall as a gathering place. The Clinton Lodge was the primary Masonic hotel to be sanctioned in Hampshire County and is among the most punctual Masonic cabins to be built up in present-day West Virginia. It was sanctioned by the Grand Lodge of Virginia on December 13, 1825.
