Mulder breaks out of jail with the assistance of Skinner, Reyes, Doggett, Scully and Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.). Mulder and Scully travel to New Mexico where helicopters devastate an Anasazi bluff staying ruin alongside The Smoking Man (William B. Davis). 

The scene included the arrival of Duchovnyâfollowing his takeoff after the eighth-season finaleâjust as a few other repeating characters. "The Truth" served to finish up some long-lasting story circular segments while making new ones for a conceivable film establishment. Shooting occurred at different California areas, including a hydroelectric power plant east of Fresno and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Carter would come back to "The X-Files" universe with a component film, "" (2008), and has freely talked about the likelihood of a third film, which would concentrate on the approaching extraterrestrial intrusion uncovered in "The Truth". 

At the Mount Weather army installation, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows up with a few government authorities. He accesses very arranged records on a safe PC framework, and is stunned and unnerved to peruse the reports, which give subtleties of the last colonization of the planet by outsider powers. Before he can keep perusing, Mulder hears someone else drawing nearer. He stows away rapidly and watches Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin), a previous companion of John Doggett (Robert Patrick) however who has been irreversibly changed into a foe "Super Soldier", approach the PC framework. Rohrer quickly understands the framework has been gotten to. Mulder endeavors to assault Rohrer, however Rohrer overwhelms him. Mulder hysterically escapes, however Rohrer outmaneuvers him. In a vicious squabble, Mulder flips Rohrer off a catwalk onto high-voltage wiring, and Rohrer obviously passes on by electric shock. Mulder endeavors to get away, however is immediately captured by a few troopers. 

Updates on Mulder's capture spreads to the FBI. After hearing that he has reemerged, and in such a desperate way, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) visit him in military care. Amid his time in bondage, Mulder gets puzzling visits from two apparitions of his past: Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) and X (Steven Williams). In the interim, Scully and Skinner put everything on the line to get him discharged, yet are fruitless. Mulder's destiny is at last made the subject of a military court with Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) in control. At the start, it shows up Mulder will turn into the sad casualty of a show preliminary stacked against him. 

Skinner takes Mulder's barrier, while Scully, Doggett, Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka) and Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) affirm on Mulder's sake. The arraignment exhibits Rohrer's body as proof against Mulder. Mindful that Rohrer is an apparently powerful "Super Soldier", Scully plays out a restorative examination and demonstrates that the body isn't that of Rohrer. Regardless of this, the proof is rejected, given that the post-mortem was not approved, and the barrier is overruled. Mulder is condemned to death for the homicide of a military officer. Afterward, Doggett, Skinner, Reyes, and Scully help Mulder escape, with the startling help of Kersh who chose he ought to have let Mulder go in any case. In spite of being encouraged to quickly leave the mainland by means of Canada, Mulder rather takes Scully to New Mexico. On their way, Mulder gets a visit by three extra phantoms: The Lone Gunmen, who encourage him to escape for his life as opposed to proceed with his quest for reality. Mulder courteously decreases. In the interim, Doggett and Reyes discover their office exhausted, recommending that the X-Files have been shut down for the third time. 

Mulder and Scully touch base at Anasazi vestiges to locate an "insightful man" who they accept can comprehend the characterized reports Mulder has perused. They find the supposed "savvy man" is none other than The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), who, still alive all things considered, is hanging out to endure the colonizationâan occasion that will occur on DecemberÂ 22, 2012, the anticipated apocalypse. Outside, Reyes and Doggett arrive and get ready to battle Rohrer, who has been sent to execute Mulder and The Smoking Man. Rohrer is slaughtered when the magnetite in the remains influences his superhuman body. Exchanging vehicles with Mulder and Scully, Doggett and Reyes drive off. Dark helicopters demolish the precipice homesâand The Smoking Man insideâimagining that Mulder is still inside before taking off. Doggett and Reyes are most recently seen dashing ceaselessly. 

In a motel room in Roswell, New Mexico, Mulder and Scully get ready for bed and talk. Mulder clarifies his conviction "that the dead are not lost to us. That they address us as a feature of an option that is more noteworthy than usâmore prominent than any outsider power. Furthermore, on the off chance that you and I are feeble now, I need to trust that on the off chance that we tune in to what's talking, it can enable us to spare ourselves." Despite their remote possibility for progress, Mulder pronounces, "Perhaps there's expectation", as they lay back, content in one another's arms, in an adoring grasp. 

The scene was composed by arrangement maker Chris Carter. He noticed, "It's the endâyou don't get another opportunity. So you would be wise to put all that you've at any point needed to place in into the scene. There were things to occupy us based on what was truly going on. The band was separating." He clarified the thought, saying that official maker Frank Spotnitz and he chose "it was presumably time to go [...] it was odd to compose these things realizing it was the last time we'd see Scully doing certain things or hear Mulder saying certain things." Spotnitz clarified that Carter made the declaration in January so that "we had room schedule-wise to fold our brains over the end and plan for it and give the majority of the characters their due." Gish later stated, "I have an extraordinary regard for the exquisite manner by which they're shutting the drapery". Performing artist Bruce Harwood, who played John Fitzgerald Byers on the show, considered the finale the "death of an age". 

A few of the scene's scenes highlight components that allude to the prior portions. The last scene in which Mulder and Scully talk in a lodging is reminiscent of the arrangement's pilot scene. Moreover, in "The Truth," it is uncovered to Mulder by The Smoking Man that the outsiders intend to colonize the earth on DecemberÂ 22, 2012, an occasion that, as per the show, the Mayans anticipated. This is a return to the second season scene "Red Museum," which highlighted individuals from another religious development who trusted that the year 2012 would realize the unfolding of the New Age. 

Before the arrival of the 2008 film "", Carter communicated a plan to make a third "X-Files" highlight film that would concentrate on the looming outsider attack uncovered in this scene, contingent upon the accomplishment of "The X-Files: I Want to Believe". Following the arrival of "The X-Files: I Want to Believe", Carter, Spotnitz, Duchovny, and Anderson all communicated their enthusiasm for making one. In any case, on January 17, 2015, Fox Television Group administrator and CEO Gary Newman uncovered that there was organize enthusiasm for restoring "The X-Files", not as a film establishment, however as a restricted run TV occasion. 

With this scene, Duchovny rejoined the fundamental cast of "The X-Files" after his takeoff following the eighth season finale "Presence". The scene denotes the main time that every one of the five chief on-screen charactersâDuchovny, Anderson, Patrick, Gish, and Pileggiâare credited together in the opening titles. Mulder, Scully, and the Smoking Man are the main characters to show up in both this scene and the arrangement's pilot. This scene is the fourth of just four scenes in season nine where Duchovny showed up, the others being "Trust No 1", "Bounce the Shark", and "William". Duchovny showed up in the initial two by means of chronicled film and just made a little appearance in the third. The scene denotes the arrival of a few characters who had either recently been murdered off or had left the show, including X, who was executed in the season four opener "Herrenvolk"; Alex Krycek, who was shot and slaughtered by Skinner in the eighth-season finale "Presence"; The Smoking Man, who was purportedly slaughtered in "Composition"; Gibson Praise, who was most recently seen in the eighth-season scene "Without"; The Lone Gunmen, who were executed off in the ninth-season scene "Hop the Shark"; Jeffrey Spender, who initially was slaughtered off in the 6th season scene "One Son" however returned in the ninth-season scene "William"; and Marita Covarrubias, who last showed up in the seventh season finale "Memorial". 

Initially, this scene was to include the common character Shannon McMahon. Be that as it may, on-screen character Lucy Lawless ended up pregnant soon after taping the two-section scene, "Nothing Important Happened Today" and was not accessible for ensuing scenes. On-screen character Julia Vera was brought in to assume the job of the lady who is helping the Smoking Man live in the Anasazi ruins. Vera had recently showed up in the 6th season two-section scene "Fantasy land". She later called the open door "stunning" and pronounced that "my most noteworthy experience was "The X-Files"". The last scene of the scene was initially going to include the Toothpick Man, the outsider head of the New Syndicate played by Alan Dale, educating U.S. President George W. Shrubbery, played by on-screen character Gary Newton, of Mulder's departure. The scene was recorded, however was excluded in the communicate rendition; official maker Frank Spotnitz later said that he was "happy to the point" that the makers cut the scene, taking note of thatâin spite of "a great deal of discussion about it, on the two sides"â the scene was unfit to top the last scene with Mulder and Scully. On the DVD's sound analysis, the makers referenced that they had considered shooting the shot on the Oval Office set made by "The West Wing", a sequential show made by Aaron Sorkin that was initially communicated on NBC. Furthermore, they initially needed to have Martin Sheen show up as his character on "The West Wing", Josiah Bartlet, rather than Bush, noticing that the appearance would have been "a pleasant, kind of wink" to the TV group of onlookers. In spite of being cut from the last scene, the shot was highlighted as an erased scene on the season nine video discharge. 

Most of the sceneâlike the remainder of seasons six, seven, eight and nineâwas taped in Los Angeles, California. The principal scene, highlighting Mulder breaking into an army installation, was shot in a hydroelectric power plant east of Fresno, California. The rooms that were included in the scene were the primary spaces for the power plant that "The X-Files" structure group rearranged; the team later considered the set the "war room". A large portion of the enhancement and inside scene was finished by the special visualization group; the main noticeable part found, in actuality, was a huge sump siphon. Bill Roe, the cinematographer for the scene, went through "four or five days lighting [the] set" for taping. Kim Manners called his work "an extraordinary activity". The scenes that happen in the primary work station room were shot on a twentieth Century Fox sound stage, while the scenes with Mulder being tormented by the military gatekeepers were shot at Fort MacArthur, a previous army installation in San Pedro, California that was decommissioned in 1974, including The Marine Mammal Care Center situated at Fort MacArthur. Taping the court was a standout amongst the "most testing arrangements" Manners had ever done. Carter needed the court to have no onlookers and no jury. This implied Manners needed to shoot every scene with a set number of performing artists and make them look "new". Habits was panicked to film the 40-page long court scene, calling attention to that the show was essentially re-telling a nine-year history of "The X-Files". Corey Kaplan structured the set. 

The Anasazi ruins were developed in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Area chief Mac Gordon later noticed that, because of the nearness of an uncommon "spiked dark horned frog" in the zone, he and his group were compelled to contract a few scientists to find any reptiles in the region and move them somewhere else. What's more, Gordon had a troublesome time inducing the recreation center officers to develop and afterward blow fake vestiges. He clarified, "we were on a state leave property that was a rough terrain leave, with bikes and [All-territory vehicles] flying everywhere, except regardless they whitened when I said we need to construct Indian destroys and after that explode it." However, the appearance of The Smoking Man was taped on the twentieth Century Fox sound stage. Habits noticed that Davis had "one serious time" endeavoring to smoke his cigarettes through a gap in his neck, in light of the fact that the gap was "fake". The scene including The Smoking Man being wrecked by the flame from a rocket was done by means of PC liveliness. The rockets were made by means of CGI innovation by artist Mat Beck. The helicopter, be that as it may, included genuine smoke bombs. A fix of William B. Davis was covered with flame, and in the end a skull to give the impact that The Smoking Man's substance was consumed with extreme heat. Paul Rabwin later considered the scene an "incredible arrangement". 

The last scene of the scene shot was among Anderson and Duchovny and was classified "amazingly extreme" by Manners, because of it being "passionate". He noticed that the scene "aggregates up the arrangement" about a "man who accepted and a lady who was distrustful however turned into an adherent". The scene was recorded at a real motel, called La Cresenta. The area had recently been utilized in scenes "Sein Und Zeit" and "This isn't Happening". 

The last scene, including a discussion among Mulder and Scully, has been inspected by creator V. Alan White because of its apparent religious feelings. In the book "The Philosophy of The X-Files", he takes note of that the last scene "undermines Mulder's apparently relentless hatred of conventional" religion and his inconspicuous acknowledgment of belief in a higher power. In past scenesâpredominantly those managing Scully's CatholicismâMulder demonstrates an absence of endorsement when it went to the idea of sorted out religion, regularly bringing up that "scholars can be similarly as fanatical as researchers" with regards to unexplained marvels. White recommends this needling might be deliberate on Mulder's part, as a type of "amusing inversion of [Scully's] incredulity about the paranormal". Be that as it may, the last lines of "The Truth" see Mulder discussing a confidence in "an option that is more prominent than us, more noteworthy than any outsider power". White likewise brings up the way that amid this scene Mulder gets Scully's gold cross, a symbol that symbolizes her conviction through a great part of the arrangement. 

A few of the scene's scenes and themes have been contrasted with misconceptions and legends. Michelle Bush, in her book "Fantasy X", likened Mulder's general journey to that of the scan for the Holy Grail. She takes note of that in "The Truth", Mulder and Scully figuratively "discover their way to the Grail mansion" just to find that the Fisher Kingâthe injured knight accused of securing the mysteryâis really The Smoking Man. Moreover, Bush looked at the last scene of the sceneâhighlighting Mulder pondering about expectation in regards to an outsider attackâto the fantasy of Pandora's Box. As per legend, the antiquated Greek divine beings gave Pandora a container loaded up with shades of malice and advised her not to open it. Because of her interest, she resisted and released different cataclysms unto the world. Shrub contends that the Syndicate's messing with outsider innovation, for example, their outsider human crossover testsâare like the substance of the case. She noticed that, in the two cases, "man's interest is his ruin". At last, notwithstanding, both Pandora's crate and the universe of "The X-Files" contain trust, which, in the legend, was the main thing in the container that Pandora did not relinquish. 

"The Truth" was initially publicized on the Fox organize on MayÂ 19, 2002, and turned into the most-watched scene of the ninth season, accepting the season's most noteworthy Nielsen evaluations. Nielsen evaluations are crowd estimation framework that decide the group of onlookers size and arrangement of TV programming in the United States. "The Truth" earned a family unit rating of 7.5, implying that it was seen by 7.5Â percent of the country's assessed families. It was seen by a sum of 13.25 million watchers in the United States. On the date of its airing, the scene positioned third in its timeslot, behind the season finale of "" and the intensely advanced get-together of "The Cosby Show". "The Truth", notwithstanding, set in front of the period finale of "The Practice". In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the scene showed up on Sky1 on SeptemberÂ 26, 2002 and got 1.03Â million watchers, putting "The X-Files" second in the main ten communicates for Sky1 for that week, behind "The Simpsons". The scene was incorporated on "The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4Â â Super Soldiers", a DVD gathering that contains portions required with the outsider "Super Soldiers" circular segment. 

The section got blended audits by pundits; the fundamental explanation behind analysis was that, rather than making an end, the scene brought up new issues for the gathering of people. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Needing to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium and The Lone Gunmen", gave the scene a blistering survey and granted it one star out of five. The two, regardless of calling the opening "promising", ridiculed the scene's closureâparticularly the disclosure of outsider colonization of DecemberÂ 22, 2012âexpressing, "is this truly what the arrangement was about?" Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson presumed that the issue with the scene was that the show, which he called "splendidâevery now and again, really splendid" chose "to characterize itself in the summing up" with the scene, which did not address a lot of inquiries. UGO named the scene the fourteenth "Most exceedingly awful Series Finale" and composed that the sceneâand the show's eighth and ninth seasons by expansionâwere contrarily influenced by the arrangement's absence of a characterizing plot line. The article noticed that, while the scene professed to wrap up the story circular segments for the arrangement, "the preliminary of Mulder at last brought about next to no delightful result to the arrangement's larger secrets". Joyce Millman, composing for "The New York Times", after the debut of "The Truth", said of the show: "The most inventive show on TV has at long last achieved the cutoff points of its creative ability." M.A. Crang, in his book "Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11", was disparaging of the scene's preliminary groupings. While he expressed that these scenes "work admirably of uniting the numerous different strings of this circular segment", he felt that they were "endlessly dull". 

Not all audits were basic. Tom Kessenich, in his book "Examinations", composed a fairly positive audit of the scene. He noticed that, while the scene "revealed to us nothing of essentialness" in regards to the "master plan" folklore story curve, the opportunity to see Mulder and Scully together one final time brought about "a dazzling Mulder-Scully minute". He was especially satisfied with the last scene, taking note of that it was a suitable end; he called it "fitting", just as "brilliant". Kessenich kept up that, were it not for the arrival of Duchovny, "no one would have cared the slightest bit about the finish of this arrangement." Julie Salamon of "The New York Times" gave the scene a positive audit. Salamon noticed that "Until the end, the arrangement kept up its entrancing visual melancholy, shrewdly punctuated with suggestive plays of shading and light". She asserted the show "likewise held its fear inspired notion heart that has advanced so extraordinarily to watchers". John C. Snider of SciFiDimensions applauded the scene, expressing "The Truth is a wonderful end to the arrangement, with a lot of wanders aimlessly, a couple of shock visitor appearances, and a dangerous finale complete with essential dark helicopters. The sentimental people among us will likewise be satisfied with the climax of the Mulder/Scully relationship". 

In 2011, the finale was positioned number twenty-two on the TV Guide Network unique, "television's Most Unforgettable Finales".
