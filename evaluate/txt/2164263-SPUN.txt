Runaway Scrape 

The Runaway Scrape occasions occurred mostly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the departures by Texas occupants escaping the Mexican Army of Operations amid the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the unequivocal Battle of San Jacinto. The "temporary" legislature of the new Republic of Texas and a great part of the non military personnel populace fled eastbound in front of the Mexican powers. The contention emerged after Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna annulled the 1824 constitution of Mexico and set up military law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians opposed and announced their freedom. It was Sam Houston's duty, as the designated president of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such a military really existed), to select and prepare a military power to guard the populace against troops driven by Santa Anna. 

Occupants on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de BÃ©xar started emptying in January after learning of the Mexican armed force's troop developments into their region, an occasion that was eventually replayed crosswise over Texas. Amid early clashes, some Texian warriors surrendered, trusting that they would progress toward becoming detainees of war â however Santa Anna requested their executions. The updates on the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad slaughter imparted dread in the populace and brought about the mass departure of the non military personnel populace of Gonzales, where the opening skirmish of the Texian unrest had started and where, just days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a local army to fortify the protectors at the mission. The regular citizen outcasts were joined by the recently shaping temporary armed force, as Houston purchased time to prepare troopers and make a military structure that could contradict Santa Anna's more prominent powers. Houston's activities were seen as weakness by the "temporary" government, just as by his very own portion troops. As he and the displaced people from Gonzales got away first to the Colorado River and afterward to the Brazos, evacuees from different zones streamed in and new state army bunches landed to unite with Houston's power. 

The towns of Gonzales and San Felipe de Austin were scorched to keep them out of the hands of the Mexican armed force. Santa Clause Anna was resolved to executing individuals from the Republic's interval government, who fled from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Groce's Landing to Harrisburg and New Washington. The administration authorities in the end ran away to Galveston Island, and Santa Anna consumed the towns of Harrisburg and New Washington when he neglected to discover them. Around 5,000 frightened occupants of New Washington fled from the Mexican armed force. Following barely a month of preparing the troops, Houston achieved an intersection where he requested some of them to escort the escaping displaced people more distant east while he took the fundamental armed force southeast to draw in the Mexican armed force. The ensuing Battle of San Jacinto brought about the surrender of Santa Anna and the marking of the Treaties of Velasco. 

In 1834, Mexican president Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna moved from a Federalist political belief system to making a Centralist government and repudiated the nation's Constitution of 1824. That constitution had not just settled Coahuila y Tejas as another Mexican state, yet had additionally accommodated each state in Mexico to make its very own neighborhood level constitution. In the wake of killing state-level governments Santa Anna had in actuality made a tyranny and put Coahuila y Tejas under the military principle of General MartÃ­n Perfecto de Cos. At the point when Santa Anna made Miguel BarragÃ¡n transitory president, he additionally had BarragÃ¡n introduce him as leader of the Mexican Army of Operations. Expecting to put down all defiance in Coahuila y Tejas, he started hoarding his military on November 28, 1835, before long pursued by General JoaquÃ­n RamÃ­rez y Sesma driving the Vanguard of the Advance over the Rio Grande in December. 

Stephen F. Austin was administrator of the current unpaid volunteer Texian armed force, and at his encouraging the Consultation of 1835 gathered in San Felipe de Austin on November 3 of that year. Their making of a temporary government dependent on the 1824 constitution built up the General Council as an authoritative body with every district apportioned one agent. Henry Smith was chosen representative with no plainly characterized forces of the position. Sam Houston was in participation as the chosen delegate from Nacogdoches, and furthermore filled in as officer of the Nacogdoches volunteer army. Edward Burleson supplanted Austin as administrator of the volunteer armed force on December 1. 

On December 10, the General Council called new decisions to pick agents to decide the destiny of the area. The Consultation endorsed the production of the Provisional Army of Texas, a paid power of 2,500 troops. Houston was named president of the new armed force and issued an enlistment Proclamation on December 12. 

The volunteer armed force under Burleson disbanded on December 20. 

Harrisburg was assigned the seat of a profoundly partitioned temporary government on December 30. The greater part of the General Council needed to remain some portion of Mexico, yet with the reclamation of the 1824 constitution. Representative Smith bolstered the restricting group who supported for complete freedom. Smith disintegrated the General Council on January 10, 1836, yet it was indistinct on the off chance that he had the ability to do that. He was indicted on January 11. The power battle successfully closed down the administration. 

The Convention of 1836 met at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1. The next day, the 59 delegates made the Republic of Texas by appending their marks to the Texas Declaration of Independence. Houston's military specialist was developed March 4, to incorporate "the land powers of the Texian armed force both Regular, Volunteer, and Militia." The agents chose the Republic's "substitute" government on March 16, with David G. Burnet as president, Lorenzo de Zavala as VP, Samuel P. Carson as secretary of state, Thomas Jefferson Rusk as secretary of war, Bailey Hardeman as secretary of the treasury, Robert Potter as secretary of the naval force, and David Thomas as lawyer general. 

The Battle of Gonzales was the beginning of a chain of occasions that prompted what is known as the Runaway Scrape. The showdown started in September 1835, when the Mexican government endeavored to recover a bronze gun that it had given to Gonzales in 1831 to ensure the town against Indian assaults. The principal endeavor by Corporal Casimiro De LeÃ³n brought about De LeÃ³n's separation being taken detainees, and the gun being covered in a peach plantation. James C. Neill, a veteran who had served at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend under Andrew Jackson, was placed accountable for the gunnery after it was later uncovered and wheel mounted. At the point when Lieutenant Francisco de CastaÃ±eda arrived joined by 100 troopers and made a second endeavor at repossessing the gun, Texians challenged the Mexicans to "come and take it". John Henry Moore drove 150 Texian local army on October 2 in effectively repulsing the Mexican troops. A "Come and Take It" banner was later molded by the ladies of Gonzales. The gun was moved to San Antonio de BÃ©xar and wound up one of the big guns pieces utilized by the safeguards of the Alamo. 

The quick consequence of the Texian triumph at Gonzales was that two days after the fact the quantity of volunteers had swelled to more than 300, and they were resolved to drive the Mexican armed force out of Texas. All the while, an organization of volunteers under George M. Collinsworth caught the Presidio La BahÃ­a from the Mexicans on October 9 at the Battle of Goliad. The Mexican government's reaction to the agitation in Texas was an October 30 approval of war. On the banks of the Nueces River from San Patricio on November 4 amid the Battle of LipantitlÃ¡n, volunteers under Ira Westover caught the fortification from Mexican troops. 

By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de BÃ©xar. Stephen F. Austin sent a development scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to watch the Mexican powers. While taking shelter at Mission ConcepciÃ³n on October 28, they repulsed an assault by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea amid the fight. Austin kept on sending troops to BÃ©xar. Bowie was requested on November 26 to assault a Mexican supply train asserted to convey a finance. The subsequent encounter wound up known as the Grass Fight, after it was found that the main payload was grass to encourage the steeds. At the point when Austin was chosen to join Branch T. Bowman and William H. Wharton on a discretionary mission to look for global acknowledgment and backing, Edward Burleson was named as authority. On December 5, James C. Neill started diverting Cos by terminating cannons legitimately at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson drove a few hundred volunteers in an unexpected assault. The battling at the Siege of BÃ©xar proceeded until December 9 when Cos sent word he needed to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, yet would later join with Santa Anna's powers. 

Around 300 of the Texian battalion at BÃ©xar left on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in an arranged assault to catch the port for its monetary assets. Defenders of this crusade were trusting Mexican Federalists would remove Santa Anna and reestablish the 1824 constitution. At the point when Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, inhabitants of the Gulf Coast started escaping the region in January 1836. Santa Clause Anna requested General JosÃ© de Urrea on February 16 to verify the Gulf Coast. About north of Matamoros at San Patricio, Urrea's troops trapped Johnson and individuals from the endeavor on February 27 at the Battle of San Patricio. Sixteen Texians were murdered, six got away, and 21 were taken prisoner. Urrea's troops at that point turned southwest by some to Agua Dulce Creek and on March 2 assaulted a gathering of the undertaking driven by Grant, slaughtering everything except 11, six of whom were taken prisoner. Five of the men got away from the Battle of Agua Dulce and joined Fannin who needed to expand the safeguard constrain at Goliad. 

Neill was elevated to lieutenant colonel amid his interest in the Siege of BÃ©xar, and after 10 days Houston set him responsible for the Texian army in the city. In January inhabitants had started emptying in front of Santa Anna's moving toward powers. Neill begged Houston for renewal of troops, supplies and weaponry. The takeoff of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with just around 100 men. By then Houston saw BÃ©xar as a military obligation and did not need Santa Anna's propelling armed force dealing with any outstanding officers or big guns. He dispatched Bowie with guidelines to evacuate the ordnance, have the safeguards desert the Alamo mission and crush it. Upon his January 19 entry and resulting exchanges with Neill, Bowie chose the mission was the ideal spot to stop the Mexican armed force in its tracks. He stayed and started to help Neill get ready for the coming assault. Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis touched base with fortifications on February 3. At the point when Neill was offered leave to take care of family matters on February 11, Travis expected order of the mission, and after three days he and Bowie consented to a joint direction. Santa Clause Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican armed force's attack on the Alamo started February 23. Skipper Juan SeguÃ­n left the mission on February 25, conveying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad mentioning more fortifications. Santa Clause Anna stretched out an idea of acquittal to Tejanos inside the post; a non-warrior survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie prompted them to take the offer. Because of Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 civilian army volunteers framed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and landed at the Alamo on February 29. 

As the nearest settlement to San Antonio de BÃ©xar, Gonzales was the encouraging point for volunteers who reacted to both the Travis letter from the Alamo and Houston's enlistment supplications. As of late shaped gatherings originated from Austin and Washington regions and from the Colorado River region. Volunteers from Brazoria, Fort Bend and Matagorda districts sorted out in the wake of landing in Gonzales. The Kentucky Rifle organization under Newport, Kentucky specialist Sidney Sherman had been supported by subsidizing from Cincinnati, Ohio occupants. 

Alamo commandant Neill was in Gonzales acquiring supplies and enlisting fortifications on March 6. At the point when Seguin learned in transit that Fannin would be unfit to achieve the Alamo in time, he promptly started gathering an all-Tejano organization of scouts. His men joined with Lieutenant William Smith's and volunteered to go with Neill's enlisted people. They experienced the Mexican armed force from the Alamo on March 7, and Neill's men turned back while the Seguin-Smith scouts pushed ahead. As the scouts neared the Alamo, they met just quiet. Andrew Barcena and Anselmo Bergara from Seguin's other separation inside the Alamo appeared in Gonzales on March 11, recounting their break and conveying updates on the butcher. Their accounts were limited; Houston, who had arrived that equivalent day, decried them as Mexican government operatives. 

Smith and Seguin affirmed the destiny of the mission upon their arrival. Houston dispatched requests to Fannin to desert Goliad, explode the Presidio La BahÃ­a fortification, and retreat to Victoria, however Fannin postponed following up on those requests. Trusting the methodology of Urrea's troops conveyed a more prominent desperation to neighborhood regular folks, he sent 29 men under Captain Amon B. Lord to help empty adjacent Refugio. 

Houston immediately started sorting out the troops at Gonzales into the First Regiment under Burleson who had touched base as a component of the Mina volunteers. A second regiment would later be framed when the military developed sufficiently vast. As others arrived, singular volunteers not as of now in another organization were put under Captain William Hestor Patton. Houston had 374 volunteers and their commandants in Gonzales on March 12. 

Santa Clause Anna sent Susanna Dickinson with her newborn child girl Angelina, Travis' slave Joe, and Mexican Colonel Juan Almonte's cook Ben to Gonzales, with dispatches written in English by Almonte to spread the updates on the fall of the Alamo. Scouts Deaf Smith, Henry Karnes and Robert Eden Handy experienced the survivors outside of Gonzales on March 13. At the point when Karnes came back with the news, very quickly 25 volunteers left. Crying filled the air when Dickinson and the others achieved the town with their direct records. 

Albeit regular citizen departures had started in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de BÃ©xar, the Texian military was either in all out attack mode or standing firm until the littler Gulf Coast clashes occurred in February. Houston was currently confronting a decision of whether to withdraw to a protected spot to prepare his new armed force, or to meet the adversary head-on right away. He was careful about endeavoring to protect a fixed position â the catastrophe at the Alamo had demonstrated that the new Texian government was unfit to give adequate arrangements or fortifications. 

Houston required a Council of War. The officers casted a ballot that the families ought to be requested to leave, and the troops would cover the retreat. By midnight, not exactly an hour after Dickinson had arrived, the consolidated armed force and non military personnel populace started an unglued move eastbound, abandoning all that they couldn't promptly get and transport. A significant part of the arrangements and mounted guns were abandoned, including two 24-pounder guns. Houston requested Salvador Flores alongside an organization of Juan Seguin's men to frame the back gatekeeper to secure the escaping families. Messengers were sent to different towns in Texas to caution that the Mexican armed force was progressing. 

The retreat occurred so rapidly that a significant number of the Texian scouts did not completely appreciate it until after the town was cleared. Houston requested Karnes to consume the town and everything in it so nothing would stay to profit the Mexican troops. Before sun-up, the whole town was in fiery remains or blazes. 

Volunteers from San Felipe de Austin who had been sorted out under Captain John Bird on March 5 to fortify the men at the Alamo had been on the way to San Antonio de BÃ©xar on March 13 when roughly east of Gonzales they experienced escaping natives and a dispatch from Sam Houston. Recounted the Alamo's fall, Bird's men offered help to the escaping natives and joined Houston's military at Bartholomew D. McClure's ranch on the night of March 14. 

At Washington-on-the-Brazos, the agents to the tradition scholarly of the Alamo's fall on March 13. The Republic's new "substitute" government was confirmed on March 17, with an office managing military covert operative activities, and dismissed that day. The administration at that point fled to Groce's Landing where they remained for a few days before proceeding onward to Harrisburg on March 21 where they set up transitory base camp in the home of widow Jane Birdsall Harris. 

Lord's men at Refugio had taken asylum in Mission Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la Rosario when they were hence assaulted by Urrea's powers. Fannin sent 120 fortifications under William Ward, however the March 14 Battle of Refugio cost 15 Texian lives. Ward's men got away, however King's men were caught and executed on March 16. 

After learning of the flight, Santa Anna sent General JoaquÃ­n RamÃ­rez y Sesma with 700 men to seek after Houston, and 600 men under General Eugenio Tolsa as fortifications. Finding just consumed stays at Gonzales, Sesma walked his military toward the Colorado River. 

The Texian armed force stayed outdoors March 15â 18 on the Lavaca River property of Williamson Daniels where they were joined by consolidated powers under Joe Bennett and Captain Peyton R. Splane. Escaping regular citizens went with Houston's military turning north at the Navidad River as they crossed toward the east side of the Colorado River at Burnam's Crossing. The ship and exchanging post, just as the family home of Jesse Burnam, were all singed at Houston's requests on March 17 to keep Santa Anna's military from making a similar intersection. 

Beason's Crossing was found where Columbus is today. DeWees Crossing was north of Beason's. From March 19 through March 26, Houston split his powers between the two intersections. Extra Texian volunteer organizations started touching base at the two intersections, including three organizations of Texas Rangers, the Liberty County Volunteers and the Nacogdoches Volunteers. 

Sesma's legion of around 725 men and ordnance stayed outdoors on the contrary side of the Colorado, at a separation somewhere between the two Texian camps. To keep Sesma's troops from utilizing the William DeWees log lodge, Sherman requested it consumed. Three Mexican scouts from Sesma's military were caught by Sherman's men, and in spite of the fact that Sherman contended for an assault on Sesma's troops, Houston was not prepared. 

Fannin had started emptying Presidio La BahÃ­a on March 19. The assessed 320 troops were low on nourishment and water, and the breakdown of a wagon enabled Urrea's men to surpass them at Coleto Creek, finishing off with Fannin's surrender on March 20. Dwindle Kerr, who had presented with Fannin and professed to have been held detainee, landed at DeWees on March 25. Houston declared Fannin's surrender, yet would later profess to have revealed proof that Kerr was a covert operative for the Mexicans. 

The Texian armed force was a power of 810 volunteers and staff now, yet few had any military preparing and experience. Looked with past abandonments, discipline blemishes, and individual uncertainty of volunteers in preparing, Houston realized they were not yet prepared to draw in the Mexican armed force. Intensifying the circumstance were the regular citizen evacuees subordinate upon the military for their security. The updates on Fannin's catch, joined with his questions about the preparation of the Texian armed force, drove Houston to arrange a retreat on March 26. A portion of the troops saw the choice as weakness with Sesma sitting just on the opposite side of the Colorado, and a few hundred men left. 

Texian overcomers of the Battle of Coleto Creek trusted their surrender concurrence with Urrea would, even from a pessimistic standpoint, mean their extradition. Santa Clause Anna, be that as it may, clung to the 1835 Tornel Decree that expressed the insurgence was a demonstration of theft instigated by the United States, and requested their executions. In spite of the fact that he by and by couldn't help contradicting the need to do as such, Urrea completed his authority's requests on March 27. Of the assessed 370 Texians being held, a couple figured out how to get away from the slaughter. The rest of shot, wounded with knifes and spears and clubbed with firearm butts. Fannin was shot through the face and his gold watch stolen. The dead were incinerated on a fire. 

It would be seven days before expression of the Goliad slaughter achieved Sam Houston. The withdrawing Texian armed force halted at San Felipe de Austin on March 28â 29 to stock up on nourishment and supplies. Houston's arrangement to move the military north to Groce's Landing on the Brazos River was met with obstruction from skippers Wyly Martin and Moseley Baker, whose units shied away from further retreat. Houston reassigned Martin south to secure the Morton Ferry crossing at Fort Bend, and Baker was requested to protect the waterway crossing at San Felipe de Austin. 

Updates on moving toward Mexican troops and Houston's retreat caused alarm among the populace in the provinces of Washington, Sabine, Shelby and San Augustine. In the midst of the perplexity of escaping occupants of those districts, two volunteer gatherings under skippers William Kimbro and Benjamin Bryant touched base to join Houston on March 29. Kimbro was requested to San Felipe de Austin to strengthen Baker's troops, while Bryant's men stayed with the primary armed force. 

After a wrong exploring report of moving toward Mexican troops, Baker consumed San Felipe de Austin to the ground on March 30. At the point when Baker asserted Houston had given him a request to do as such, Houston denied it. Houston's record was that the occupants consumed their own property to keep it out of the hands of the Mexican armed force. San Felipe de Austin's inhabitants did as those before them in getting away from the Mexican armed force, and fled toward the east. 

Amid a fourteen day time span starting March 31, the Texian armed force stayed outdoors on the west side of the Brazos River in Austin County, close to Groce's Landing (otherwise called Groce's Ferry). As Houston drove his military north towards the finding, the persistent stormy climate swelled the Brazos and undermined flooding. Groce's was changed into a preparation camp for the troops. Significant Edwin Morehouse touched base with a New York contingent of enlisted people who were promptly doled out to help Wyly Martin at Fort Bend. Regular citizen men who were escaping the Mexicans enrolled at Groce's, 

furthermore, dislodged non military personnel ladies in the camp helped the military's endeavors by sewing shirts for the fighters. 

Samuel G. Hardaway, an overcomer of Major William Ward's gathering who had gotten away from the Battle of Refugio and re-joined Fannin at the Battle of Coleto, additionally figured out how to get away from the Goliad slaughter. As he fled Goliad, he was in the long run joined by three different survivors, Joseph Andrews, James P. Trezevant and M. K. Moses. Spies for the Texian armed force found the four men and took them to Baker's camp close San Felipe de Austin on April 2. A few different overcomers of the Goliad slaughter were found on April 10 by Texian spies. Survivors Daniel Murphy, Thomas Kemp, Charles Shain, David Jones, William Brenan and Nat Hazen were taken to Houston at Groce's Landing where they enrolled to battle with Houston's military. 

Houston educated of the Goliad slaughter on April 3. Unconscious that Secretary of War Rusk was at that point on the way to Groce's with requests from President Burnet to end the military's retreat and draw in the adversary, he transferred the Goliad news by letter to Rusk. 

Enabled to expel Houston from direction and assume control over the military himself, Rusk rather surveyed Houston's arrangement of activity as right, in the wake of seeing the preparation at Groce's. Rusk and Houston shaped the Second Regiment on April 8 to serve under Sherman, with Burleson holding direction of the First Regiment. 

The steamboat "Yellowstone" under the direction of Captain John Eautaw Ross was awed into administration for the Provisional Army of Texas on April 2, and at first carried patients over the Brazos River when Dr. James Aeneas Phelps set up a field medical clinic at Bernardo Plantation. After three days, Santa Anna united with Sesma's troops, and had them assemble flatboats to cross the Brazos as the Mexicans looked to surpass and vanquish the Texians. Wyly Martin gave an account of April 8 that Mexican powers had isolated and were going both east to Nacogdoches and southeast to Matagorda. Houston strengthened Baker's post at San Felipe de Austin on April 9, as Santa Anna kept moving southeast on April 10. 

The Texian armed force was transported by the "Yellowstone" over toward the east side of the Brazos on April 12, where they set up camp at the Bernardo Plantation. In the wake of strolling from Harrisburg, future leader of the Republic Mirabeau B. Lamar touched base at Bernardo to enroll as a private in Houston's military and recommended utilizing the steamer for guerilla fighting. 

With Baker guarding the intersection at San Felipe de Austin, and Martin guarding the Morton Ferry crossing at Ford Bend, Santa Anna picked on April 12 to cross the Brazos somewhere between at Thompson's Ferry, with Sesma's men and mounted guns traverse the following day. The Mexican armed force assaulted the steamer various occasions trying to catch it, yet Ross effectively utilized cotton bunches to secure the steamer and its load, and had the capacity to keep the "Yellowstone" far from Mexican control. Houston discharged the steamboat from administration on April 14, and it proceeded to Galveston. 

The "substitute" government left Harrisburg on the steamboat "Cayuga" for New Washington in front of Santa Anna's April 15 entry, impeding his arrangements to dispense with the whole administration of the Republic of Texas. Three printers still at work on the "Broadcast and Texas Register" told the Mexican armed force that everybody in the legislature had effectively left, and Santa Anna reacted by having the printers captured and the printing presses hurled into Buffalo Bayou. Following quite a while of plundering and searching out data about the administration, Santa Anna requested the town consumed on April 18. He later attempted to put the fault for the demolition on Houston. 

Before the Texian armed force left Bernardo Plantation, they respected the landing of two guns cast in November 1835 by Greenwood and Webb in Cincinnati, Ohio, subsidized completely by the general population of that city as a gift to the Texas Revolution. The thought had emerged as a proposal from Robert F. Lytle, one of the agents who helped support Sherman's Kentucky Riflemen. Touching base in New Orleans after a protracted outing from Ohio on the Mississippi River, the guns were transported to the Gulf Coast on board the "Pennsylvania" yacht. The guns were nicknamed the "Twin Sisters", maybe out of appreciation for the twins Elizabeth and Eleanor Rice going on board the "Pennsylvania", who were to exhibit the guns upon their landing in Galveston in April 1836. At Galveston, Leander Smith had the duty of transporting the guns from Harrisburg to Bernardo Plantation in Waller County. En route, Smith enlisted 35 men into the military. Lieutenant Colonel James Neill was placed accountable for the guns once they touched base in camp. 

Martin and Baker relinquished the stream intersections on April 14 and re-joined Houston's military which had walked from Bernardo to the Charles Donoho Plantation close present-day Hempstead in Waller County. As news spread of the Mexican armed force's developments, inhabitants of Nacogdoches and San Augustine started to escape east towards the Sabine River. After refusals to proceed with the military, Martin was requested by Houston to go with dislodged families on their flight eastbound. Many officers left the military to support their families. The principle armed force separated from the displaced people now, and acting Secretary of War David Thomas exhorted Houston to move southward to verify Galveston Bay. Houston, be that as it may, was getting clashing exhortation from the bureau individuals. President Burnet had sent Secretary of State Carson to Louisiana with expectations of getting the United States armed force and individual state local armies associated with the Texas battle for autonomy. While he endeavored to verify such contribution, Carson sent a dispatch to Houston on April 14 encouraging him to withdraw right to the Louisiana-Texas verge on the Sabine River, and stick around for his opportunity before connecting with the Mexican armed force. 

The Texian armed force stayed outdoors west of present-day Tomball on April 15, at Sam McCarley's property. They withdrew the following morning and east achieved a urgent junction. One street drove east to Nacogdoches and in the long run the Sabine River and Louisiana, while the other street drove southeast to Harrisburg. The military was worried that Houston would proceed with the eastbound retreat. In spite of the fact that Houston talked about his choice with nobody, he drove the military down the southeast street. Rusk requested that a little gathering of volunteers be part from the military to verify Robbins' Ferry on the Trinity River. Houston's troops ceased medium-term on April 16 at the home of Matthew Burnet, and the following morning kept walking towards Harrisburg, southeast. 

With the outcast families being agreed a military escort eastbound and Houston walking southeast, the retreat of the Provisional Army of Texas was finished. On the walk which would prompt San Jacinto, moving the substantial mounted guns crosswise over downpour splashed territory backed off the military's advancement. The military had recently been helped with moving the Twin Sisters with bulls acquired from displaced person Pamela Martin when she trusted the military was escaping towards Nacogdoches. When she took in the military was going towards Harrisburg and an encounter with the Mexican armed force, she recovered her bulls. The Texian armed force had extended to twenty-six organizations when they achieved Harrisburg on April 18 and saw the obliteration Santa Anna had deserted. 

On requests of Santa Anna after the consuming of Harrisburg, Almonte went in quest for the "substitute" government at New Washington. Amid their flight the Republic authorities changed from steamer to ship to boat. On the last leg of the outing, Almonte at last had them in his sights, yet wouldn't fire after he saw Mrs. Burnet and her youngsters on the rowboat. Notwithstanding giving the administration a chance to escape once again, Almonte's covert operatives had misread Houston's troop developments and Santa Anna was informed that the Texian armed force was all the while withdrawing eastbound, this time through Lynchburg. 

New Washington was plundered and consumed on April 20 by Mexican troops, and upwards of 5,000 regular citizens fled, either by watercraft or crosswise over land. Those endeavoring to cross the San Jacinto River were bottlenecked for three days, and the region around the intersection changed into a displaced person camp. Burnet requested government help the whole way across Texas for escaping families. 

In a troop development that took throughout the night on an alternative pontoon, the Texian armed force crossed Buffalo Bayou at Lynchburg April 19 with 930 warriors, abandoning 255 others as watchmen or for reasons of ailment. The thought had been skimmed of abandoning the Twin Sisters as assurance, however Neill was resolute that the guns be taken into the fight. In an April 20 engagement the day preceding the primary fight Neill was seriously injured, and George Hockley took order of the overwhelming ordnance. Assessments of the Mexican armed force troop quality upon the arrival of the primary fight run from 1,250 to 1,500. 

The Texians assaulted toward the evening of April 21 while Santa Anna was still under the misinterpretation that Houston was really withdrawing. He had permitted his military time to unwind and bolster their steeds, while he slept. When he was stirred by the assault, he promptly fled on horseback, yet was later caught when Sergeant James Austin Sylvester discovered him stowing away in the grass. Houston's own record was that the fight endured "around eighteen minutes", before securing detainees and taking combat hardware. At the point when the Twin Sisters went facing the Mexican armed force's Golden Standard gun, they performed so well that Hockley's unit had the capacity to catch the Mexican gun. 

The "Yellowstone" saw war administration for the Republic once again on May 7, when it transported Houston and his detainee Santa Anna, alongside the administration Santa Anna attempted to douse, to Galveston Island. From that point, the administration and Santa Anna made a trip to Velasco for the marking of the settlements. Houston had endured a genuine injury amid the fight, and on May 28 boarded the yacht "Greenery" for medicinal treatment in New Orleans. 

Not until updates on the triumph at San Jacinto spread did the displaced people come back to their residences and organizations, or whatever was left after the annihilation brought about by the two armed forces. All through Texas, assets had been surrendered and later plundered. Organizations, homes and homesteads were cleared out by the pulverization of war. Regularly there was nothing left to return to, yet the individuals who returned home started to get their lives and push ahead. San Felipe de Austin never truly recouped from its all out obliteration. The few individuals who returned there moved somewhere else, at some point or another. Secretary of War Rusk would later laud the ladies of Texas who held their families together amid the flight, while their men volunteered to battle: "The men of Texas merit much credit, however more was expected the ladies. Equipped men confronting an adversary couldn't yet be courageous; yet the ladies, with their little kids around them, without methods for guard or capacity to oppose, confronted peril and demise with resolute mettle."
