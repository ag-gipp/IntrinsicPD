Skirmish of Bergerac 

The Battle of Bergerac was battled between Anglo-Gascon and French powers at the town of Bergerac in Gascony, in August 1345 amid the Hundred Years' War. In mid 1345 Edward III of England chose to dispatch a noteworthy assault on the French from the north, while sending littler powers to Brittany and Gascony, the last being both financially critical to the English war exertion and the proximate reason for the war. The French concentrated on the danger to northern France, leaving similarly little powers in the south west. 

Henry of Grosmont, Earl of Derby touched base in Gascony in August, and breaking with the past approach of mindful development, struck legitimately for the biggest French fixation at Bergerac. He took French powers under Bertrand I of l'Isle-Jourdain and Henri de Montigny off guard vanquished them. The French endured overwhelming setbacks and the loss of the town, a huge vital set-back. Alongside the Battle of Auberoche later in the year, it denoted an adjustment in the military equalization of intensity in the district. It was the first of a progression of triumphs which would prompt Henry of Derby being designated "a standout amongst the best warriors on the planet" by a contemporary recorder. 

Since the Norman Conquest of 1066, English rulers had held titles and grounds inside France, the ownership of which made them vassals of the lords of France. By 1337 just Gascony in south western France and Ponthieu in northern France were left. The Gascons favored their association with an inaccessible English ruler who disregarded them, to one with a French lord who might meddle in their undertakings. Following a progression of contradictions between Philip VI of France and Edward III of England, on 24 May 1337 Philip's Great Council in Paris concurred that the Duchy of Aquitaine, successfully Gascony, ought to be reclaimed into Philip's hands because Edward was in rupture of his commitments as a vassal. This denoted the beginning of the Hundred Years' War, which was to last one hundred and sixteen years. 

Amid the primary portion of the fourteenth century well more than 1,000 boats a year withdrew Gascony for England. Among their loads were more than of wine. The obligation exacted by the English Crown on wine from Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, was more than every single other custom obligations consolidated and by a long shot the biggest wellspring of state salary. Bordeaux had a populace of more than 50,000, more prominent than London's, and Bordeaux was conceivably more extravagant. In any case, at this point English Gascony had turned out to be so truncated by French infringements that it depended on imports of sustenance, to a great extent from England. Any interferences to standard transportation were at risk to starve Gascony and monetarily cripple England; the French were very much aware of this. Despite the fact that Gascony was the reason for the war, Edward had the capacity to save couple of assets for it, and beforehand when an English armed force had battled on the landmass it had worked in northern France. In most crusading seasons the Gascons had needed to depend without anyone else assets and had been hard squeezed by the French. In 1339 the French blockaded Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, notwithstanding breaking into the city with a huge power before they were repelled. Normally the Gascons could field 3,000â 6,000 men, the vast lion's share infantry, despite the fact that up to 66% of them would be secured in armies. 

The fringe among English and French region in Gascony was amazingly indistinct, with most huge landholders owning an interwoven of broadly isolated homes, maybe owing fealty to an alternate overlord for each. Every little home was probably going to have a braced pinnacle or keep, with bigger domains having palaces. Fortresses were additionally built at transport stifle focuses, to gather tolls and to confine military section, and sustained towns grew up close by all extensions and most portages over the numerous waterways in the locale. Military powers could bolster themselves by scavenging insofar as they proceeded onward at generally visit interims. On the off chance that they wished to stay in one spot for any timeframe, as was important to attack a manor, at that point access to water transport was basic for provisions of sustenance and grain and attractive for such things as attack hardware. Fighting was typically a battle for ownership of palaces and other sustained focuses, and for the impermanent steadfastness of the neighborhood respectability; the area had been in a condition of transition for a considerable length of time and numerous nearby rulers served whichever nation was more grounded, paying little respect to national ties. 

By 1345, following eight years of war, English-controlled region for the most part comprised of a beach front strip from Bordeaux to Bayonne, with confined fortresses further inland. The French had solid strongholds all through what had once been English-controlled Gascony. A few legitimately undermined Bordeaux: Libourne, toward the east enabled French armed forces to collect multi day's walk from Bordeaux; the unequivocally braced town of Blaye was arranged on the north bank of the Gironde just downstream of Bordeaux and in a situation to prohibit its indispensable seaborne correspondences; the stronghold of Langon, south of Bordeaux, blocked upstream correspondence along the Garonne, and encouraged the supply of any French power progressing on Bordeaux. 

Edward decided right off the bat in 1345 to assault France on three fronts. The Earl of Northampton would lead a little power to Brittany, a marginally bigger power would continue to Gascony under the order of the Henry, Earl of Derby and the principle power would go with Edward to France or Flanders. The past Seneschal of Gascony, Nicholas de la Beche, was supplanted by the more senior Ralph, Earl of Stafford, who cruised for Gascony in February with a development constrain. Derby was named the King's Lieutenant in Gascony on 13 March 1345 and got an agreement to raise a power of 2,000 men in England, and further troops in Gascony itself. The exceptionally nitty gritty contract of arrangement had a term of a half year from the opening of the battle in Gascony, with a possibility for Edward III to expand it for a further half year on similar terms. Derby was given a high level of self-rule, for instance his vital guidelines were: "si guerre soit, et a faire le bien q'il writer" (if there is war, do as well as can be expected). 

In mid 1345 the French chose to remain on edge in the south west. Their knowledge accurately anticipated English offensives in the three theaters, however they didn't have the cash to bring a huge armed force up in each. They foreseen, accurately, that the English wanted to attempt in northern France. Along these lines they coordinated what assets they needed to there, wanting to amass their fundamental armed force at Arras on 22 July. South western France was urged to depend without anyone else assets, yet as the Truce of Malestroit, marked in mid 1343, was still as a result, the neighborhood rulers were hesitant to burn through cash, and little was finished. 

Derby's power set out at Southampton toward the finish of May. Because of awful climate, his armada of 151 boats was compelled to shield in Falmouth for a little while in transit, at long last withdrawing on 23 July. The Gascons, prepared by Stafford to expect Derby's entry in late May and detecting the French shortcoming, took the field without him. The Gascons caught the extensive, feebly garrisoned strongholds of Montravel and Monbreton on the Dordogne toward the beginning of June; both were shocked and their seizure broke the shaky Truce of Malestroit. Stafford made a short development north to blockade Blaye with his development party and maybe 1,000 men-at-arms and 3,000 infantry of the Gascon masters. Having built up the attack he left the Gascons to indict it and continued to Langon, south of Bordeaux, and set up a second attack. The Anglo-Gascon powers at the two attacks could be promptly provided by ship. The French issued an earnest invitation to battle. 

In the interim, little autonomous gatherings of Gascons attacked over the district. Various neighborhood French gatherings went along with them, and a few minor nobles put their support behind the Anglo-Gascons. They had a few critical triumphs, however their primary impact was to secure a large portion of the frail French battalions in the area and to make them call for fortifications. The couple of portable French troops in the district immobilized themselves with attacks: of Casseneuil in the Agenais; Monchamp close Condom; and Montcuq, a solid however deliberately irrelevant palace south of Bergerac. Extensive regions were successfully undefended. 

Edward III's fundamental armed force cruised on 29 June. They secured off Sluys in Flanders until 22 July, while Edward took care of political undertakings. When they cruised, most likely aiming to arrive in Normandy, they were dissipated by a tempest and found their approach to different English ports over the next week. After over five weeks on board send the men and ponies must be landed. There was a further week's deferral while the King and his gathering discussed what to do, by which time it demonstrated difficult to make any move with the primary English armed force before winter. Mindful of this, Philip VI despatched fortifications to Brittany and Gascony. Diminish, Duke of Bourbon was named French leader in Gascony on 8 August and based himself at Agen. 

On 9 August 1345 Derby landed in Bordeaux with 500 men-at-arms, 500 mounted toxophilite and 1,000 English and Welsh foot bowmen. Following two weeks enrolling and sorting out Derby walked his power to Langon, rendezvoused with Stafford and took order of the consolidated power. Stafford had to this point sought after a careful methodology of little scale attacks. Derby's aim was very extraordinary, instead of proceed with a careful war of attacks he was resolved to strike straightforwardly at the French principle compel before it was completely amassed. The French, becoming aware of Derby's entry, amassed their powers at the deliberately critical town of Bergerac, where there was an essential extension over the Dordogne River, under the order of Bertrand de l'Isle-Jourdain. They would likewise be inside reach of the French power under Henri de Montigny, Seneschal of PÃ©rigord, attacking close-by Montcuq. After a committee of war Derby chose to assault the French here. The catch of the town, which had great waterway supply connects to Bordeaux, would furnish the Anglo-Gascon armed force with a base from which to convey the war to the French. It would likewise constrain the lifting of the attack of the adjacent united chÃ¢teau of Montcuq and separate correspondences between French powers north and south of the Dordogne. The English trusted that if the French field armed force could be beaten or occupied the town could be effectively taken. 

At some point in mid-August Derby walked from Langon with 1,200 men-at-arms, of whom 700 were Gascons, 1,500 longbowmen and 2,800 Gascon infantry. The French around Bergerac and Montcuq had 1,600 men-at-arms and an expansive however unspecified number of different troops. Derby's military moved quick and shocked the French powers. The accurate date of the fight is obscure; A.H. Burne gives the fall of Bergerac as 26 August yet holds that the fight occurred some prior days, while Kenneth Fowler gives the date of the fall of Bergerac as 24 August. 

Precisely where the initial segment of the fight occurred is likewise obscure. The cutting edge antiquarian Clifford Rogers presents the defense for the street between St. Aubin-de-Langais and St. Nexans. Fowler trusts it was out and about from Montcuq to Bergerac. The French, either attracted from Bergerac by a ploy or during the time spent pulling back from their attack of Montcuq, or both, were gotten out and about by the Anglo-Gascon armed force. They were liable to a blast of English arrow based weaponry and struck by a charge by the Anglo-Gascon men-at-arms. The French were directed and a running battle occurred as they fled toward the St. Madeleine suburb of Bergerac, at the south end of the extension. Since the interest was so close, it was difficult to close the doors on the barbican at the south end of the scaffold and it was overwhelm. The followers went ahead to the extension, which was long, restricted, and blocked most of the way along by a house of prayer. The battalion endeavored to foray to verify the barbican and the extension wound up stuck with Frenchmen. English bowmen swam out to sandbanks in the waterway and enfiladed the hysterical French from the two flanks. They "were slaughtered in incredible numbers" and many surrendered to the Anglo-Gascons squeezing not far behind them. Endeavors to drop the portcullis on the north end of the scaffold were ruined by an injured pony falling in the entryway. The Anglo-Gascons proceeded to assault the town itself. 

Now the contemporary sources contrast. The two fundamental narratives covering the entire war, Froissart's "The Chronicles of England, France and Spain" and the "St. Omer Chronicle", express that the door was shut and that the town withstood an attack for a few days, falling simply after Derby had pontoons raised waterway to empower an assault on the feeble riverside divider. A bigger gathering of fourteenth century sources, including the two which center explicitly around the war in Gascony, the "Chronique de Guyenne" and the "Chronique de Brazas", express that the entryway was conveyed by the main ambush, on a similar day as the fight, and after sunset. There is other narrative proof to help this sentiment and it is commonly acknowledged by present day students of history, for example, Rogers and Jonathan Sumption. In any occasion, regardless of whether a few days after the fact or on the night of the fight, the town was caught and sacked, and a lot of provisions and ponies was caught. The enduring French from the field armed force which had been attacking Montcuq were assembled by John, Count of Armagnac, and withdrew north to PÃ©rigueux. 

The fight and consequent catch of Bergerac were significant triumphs; the loot from the vanquished French armed force and from sacking the town was enormous. More than 600 French men-at-arms were recorded as murdered, and an extensive number were caught. Misfortunes among the French infantry are not recorded but rather were accounted for to have been overwhelming; as was standard, the majority of the regular officers were murdered, paying little mind to whether they were all the while remaining battle ready. Detainees included Henri de Montingny, ten other aristocrats and an extensive number of lesser nobles. A lot of the payoffs and the plunder was assessed at Â£34,000 (Â£ in 2019 terms), roughly multiple times the yearly pay from his territories. English and Gascon misfortunes were extremely light. 

It was the first of a progression of triumphs which would prompt Derby being designated "a standout amongst the best warriors on the planet" by a contemporary writer in "Chroniques de quatres head Valois" and to present day students of history applauding his generalship as: "[a] magnificent and imaginative strategist" (Rogers); "ris[ing] to the dimension of virtuoso" (Rogers); "splendid in the outrageous" (Burne); "shocking" (Gribit). Present day history specialist Nicholas Gribit has portrayed Derby's multi month crusade of 1345 as "the primary effective land battle of... the Hundred Years' War". 

Deliberately, the Anglo-Gascon armed force had verified an imperative base for further tasks. Politically, neighborhood masters who had been uncertain in their faithfulness had been demonstrated that the English were again a power to be figured with in Gascony. Alongside the Battle of Auberoche later in the year, it denoted an adjustment in the military equalization of intensity in the locale.
