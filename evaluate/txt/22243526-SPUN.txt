The University of Washington moved from its downtown grounds toward the north side of Portage Bay in 1895, later extending amid the Alaskaâ Yukonâ Pacific Exposition of 1909 that was facilitated at the site. In 1911, urban organizer Virgil Bogue's rejected thorough arrangement for Seattle imagined a citywide tram framework, including a line serving the east side of the college grounds and associated with Ravenna and eastern Capitol Hill. The Forward Thrust Committee's arranged provincial fast travel framework, which was dismissed by voters in 1968 and 1970, incorporated a metro station at the University Hospital close Husky Stadium, from where trains would proceed with south through Capitol Hill to Downtown Seattle. A 1986 territorial travel plan from the Puget Sound Council of Governments proposed a light rail line through the University District, including a station at the University Hospital, proceeding through Eastlake to Downtown Seattle. 

During the 1990s, a provincial travel specialistâlater Sound Transitâwas framed to manufacture a light rail framework for the Seattle metropolitan region. The University District was named as a noteworthy goal for the framework and given two stations at NE Pacific Street and NE 45th Street on the western side of the college grounds, which would be associated with Downtown Seattle by means of a passage under Capitol Hill. The $6.7 billion proposition, including a light rail line proceeding with north from the University District to Northgate and Lynnwood, was dismissed by voters in 1995 and supplanted with a littler arrangement.

Looked with spending issues and further timetable deferrals, Sound Transit conceded development of the fragment between Downtown Seattle and the University District in 2001 while reexamining arrangement alternatives. The options were limited to two choices in mid 2002: a passage under the Ship Canal at University Bridge with a solitary station at Northeast 45th Street; and a passage under the Montlake Cut and stations close Husky Stadium and at Northeast 45th Street.
