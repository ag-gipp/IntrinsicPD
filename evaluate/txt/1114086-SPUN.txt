Denoting Vidler's directorial debut, the movie was adjusted from the play of a similar name, likewise composed by Enright, which was roused by the homicide of Leigh. The film stars Laurence Breuls, Simon Lyndon and Linda Cropper, and furthermore includes the primary credited film execution of Heath Ledger. The film pursues Jared (Breuls), a youthful surfer who observes his companions assaulting a young lady. When she is discovered killed the following day, Jared is torn between uncovering what he saw and securing his companions. 

Leigh's family contradicted the fictionalization of her homicide, however challenges the film were surrendered after it got money related support from the New South Wales Film and Television Office. "Blackrock" was taped over a time of about fourteen days at areas including Stockton, where Leigh was killed, a choice that was contradicted by neighborhood inhabitants who said that recollections of the homicide were still new. While the film was never advertised as being founded on a genuine story, various examinations between the homicide and the film were made, and numerous watchers trusted it to be a real record of the homicide. 

The film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, and was likewise appeared at the Boston Film Festival, however it neglected to locate an American showy merchant. It was designated for five AACTA Awards, including Best Film, and won the Feature Film â Adaptation grant just as the Major Award at the 1997 AWGIE Awards. It got commonly positive audits in Australia, where it netted $1.1 million in the cinematic world. Outside Australia, where groups of onlookers were less acquainted with Leigh's homicide, basic gathering of the film was blended. 

Blackrock is an Australian beachside regular workers suburb where surfing is prevalent among adolescents like Jared (Laurence Breuls). His first genuine sweetheart is Rachel (Jessica Napier), who originates from an a lot wealthier piece of the city. At some point, Ricko (Simon Lyndon), a surfer mainstream among the nearby adolescents, comes back from an eleven-month trip. Jared's mom Diane (Linda Cropper) endeavors to reveal to Jared that she has been determined to have bosom malignant growth, however Jared demands conversing with her later as he is caught up with masterminding an "appreciated home" party for Ricko at the nearby surf club. Rachel's dad, a picture taker who takes provocative pictures of ladies, prohibits her from going to the gathering, however he permits her more seasoned sibling Toby (Heath Ledger) to visit. 

While heading to the gathering, Toby sees Tracy (Bojana Novakovic), Cherie (Rebecca Smart) and two different young ladies, and gives them a ride. Jared plays with Tracy at the gathering and along these lines gets into a battle with Toby. Ricko goes to Jared's guard, however Jared separates the battle after Ricko has hit Toby a few times. Tracy comes to comfort Toby and Jared leaves the gathering to go to the shoreline alone. Jared sees Toby having consensual sex with Tracy on the shoreline. He at that point observers three of his male companions intruding on the couple and assaulting Tracy. Tracy gets out for help, however Jared, who is unmistakably exasperates by what he is seeing, does not mediate. Toby and the other three young men, who never saw Jared was viewing, escape the territory. Jared likewise flees, disregarding Tracy and bothered. Soon thereafter Rachel, who has escaped home to go to the gathering, discovers Tracy's beaten body on the shoreline. 

Jared at first tells the police nothing of what he saw. He is torn between the need to come clean and the craving to secure his companions; his annoyance prompts the breakdown of his associations with both Rachel and Diane. In spite of Jared's quiet, police capture Toby and the three different young men inside a couple of days. Jared chooses to tell the police what he saw, as he trusts Toby and the different young men will be accused of Tracy's homicide; in any case, on his way into the police headquarters he is stood up to by Ricko. Ricko admits to Jared that he executed Tracy, however asserts it was a mishap â that she hit her head on a stone when he endeavored to engage in sexual relations with her. He has just told police that he was with Jared throughout the night and asks Jared to affirm his vindication for the sake of mateship. Diane, who still has not had the capacity to reveal to Jared that she has malignancy because of his conduct, goes in to have medical procedure. 

Jared tells the police that he was with Ricko; when he endeavors to recommend Tracy's passing may have been a mishap, the police demonstrate to him the photographs of Tracy's battered body. Jared forcefully goes up against Ricko at the shoreline and Ricko admits that Tracy's passing was not a mishap. He had discovered her strolling on the shoreline after the assault and she requested that he take her home. He concurred, yet needed to have intercourse with her first. She attempted to ward him off and bit him all the while, which infuriated him enough to pound the life out of her. 

As Ricko completes his admission, the police arrive and he understands that Jared has handed him over. He endeavors to escape yet the police give pursue and corner him on a bluff. As opposed to go to imprison, and disregarding Jared's shouts of challenge, he bounces to his demise. In the weeks that pursue, Jared's life breakdown. In spite of learning of Diane's ailment, he moves out of her home, picking rather to be destitute. Jared returns home one day to gather his possessions; in the wake of belligerence with Diane, he admits that he saw Tracy's assault and could have spared her life on the off chance that he had mediated or helped her thereafter. Soon thereafter, Jared joins Diane and Cherie in cleaning spray painting from Tracy's grave. 

Writing in the diary "Antipodes", scholastics Felicity Holland and Jane O'Sullivan acknowledge the film for investigating the topics of Australian manliness, mateship, brutality and sexuality. The film's depiction of an assault and murder at a high school party proposes that genuine wrongdoing can emerge from drinking and fun basically escaping hand. The savagery, they state, emits from outrageous larikkinism as opposed to the prototype psychopathy seen in different movies highlighting viciousness towards ladies. The film's study of criminal manliness undermines the status of recently commended manly crooks in Australian history and film, for example, Ned Kelly and Mick Dundee. The creators trust that the attention on manliness leaves the female unfortunate casualty to a great extent out of the film; they consider the "close eradication" of Tracy to be an alarming viewpoint; the film rather centers around depicting the guys as casualties of their class, manliness and mateship. 

Executive Steven Vidler said the film was not about an assault, rather it was "about the way of life that enabled it to occur." Vidler safeguarded the decision to give the assault injured individual a minor job, expressing, "demonstrate this could have transpired. We would not like to give away a lot about the person in question so we could keep up that anticipation." Producer David Elfick said that the film was about contemporary Australia; about "kids who have for their entire life to appreciate, at that point a destructive blend of medications, liquor, sexual pressure, and want mean a catastrophe." 

Brian Joyce, the executive of Newcastle's Freewheels Theater in Education, moved toward dramatist Nick Enright, urging him to make a play that investigated topics around the 1989 assault and murder of Leigh in Stockton, a shoreline region of Newcastle. Leigh's family protested the fictionalization of her homicide. Titled "A Property of the Clan", the 45-minute play debuted at the Freewheels Theater in 1992 and was performed at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1993. The play was appeared different secondary schools in the Newcastle region and, following its positive gathering, was appeared at secondary schools the nation over a time of eighteen months. 

In 1994, the Sydney Theater Company authorized Enright to form the play into a full length creation. The subsequent play was titled "Blackrock". "Blackrock" held the first four characters from "A Property of the Clan", and included nine others; it was viewed as a more fictionalized variant of Leigh's homicide. The account and accentuation were reshaped for a grown-up crowd instead of for an explicitly instructive condition. 

While the amendments to the play "Blackrock" were all the while being finished, Enright began working with first-time executive Steven Vidler to coordinate a film rendition, which would likewise be titled "Blackrock". By December 1995, Vidler was working with Enright as an informal content proofreader, in spite of the fact that they were experiencing difficulty discovering financing for the film. Vidler said he considered coordinating the film "Blackrock" in the wake of having watched and been moved by the showy adaptation, saying the play was "completely what it resembled [for him] experiencing childhood in the Western Suburbs... It's tied in with keeping reinforced with your mates. Nothing else matters... It's about the inconceivable lengths young men will go to keep those bonds strong." Leigh's mom Robyn battled to have generation of the film stopped, however her endeavors bombed after the film got government budgetary support from the New South Wales Film and Television Office. 

"Blackrock" was taped over a time of about fourteen days with a cast and group of around 70. A call for additional items got an excited reaction by numerous young people in the Newcastle zone. Recording areas included Stockton, Maroubra Beach, Caves Beach, and NESCA House. Eminent Stockton tourist spots found in the film incorporate the Stockton Ferry and Stockton Bridge. 

The people group of Stockton contradicted recording in the zone, as recollections of Leigh's homicide were still new and the subtleties of the content were "much too close". At the point when producers touched base in Stockton in late August 1996, areas that had recently been saved were abruptly no longer accessible. The neighborhood media treated them with threatening vibe. Previous Newcastle appointee city hall leader and Stockton occupant Frank Rigby scrutinized the film amid creation, saying "I would simply adore it to leave thus would every other person." Brian Joyce was additionally condemning of the choice to film in the region, saying the movie producers needed to recognize the decision they had made in doing as such. The circumstance was exacerbated by the producers' disavowal that the film was explicitly about Leigh, notwithstanding their decision of Stockton for shooting. Amid creation in September 1996, Elfick told "The Newcastle Herald" that he was "getting somewhat exhausted" of individuals referencing Leigh's homicide. While recognizing that the remarks were reasonable, Elfick finished up, "Sadly, that occasion happens all over Australia. We needed to take the occasions of that murder and numerous different homicides". He was additionally cited in "The Sydney Morning Herald" as saying, "The motion picture is greater than the Leigh thing". Elfick trusted that individuals seeing the film would consider it to be a constructive method for taking a gander at the conditions that prompted Leigh's passing, and that it would make individuals think and perhaps quit something to that effect transpiring later on. Leigh's family were eagerly restricted to the film, saying that the movie producers were "devouring an awful circumstance", coldheartedly trivializing and abusing her demise, and depicting her adversely at the same time. One of Leigh's aunties wrote to "The Newcastle Herald" soon thereafter, saying "David Elfick doesn't appear to mind free exposure regardless of whether it originates from the terrible and severe strike, assault, and murder of a fourteen-year-old virgin, not as he called it: 'the Leigh thing which happens all over Australia.'" Enright said that while Leigh's homicide filled in as the motivation, the finished film is about the manner in which a community responds when one of its own individuals kills another. 

Sandy George from Australian Screen Online said that Vidler's long vocation as a performer helped him "draw the staggering exhibitions" from the film's young on-screen characters. 17-year-old Laurence Breuls was truly the principal individual to try out for the job of Jared. Hundred of others tried out however Breuls remained the most loved decision. Vidler picked Simon Lyndon, who assumed the job of Jared in the first stage creation of "Blackrock", for the job of Ricko, expressing that Lyndon had the looks, charm, and multifaceted nature to assume the job. Rebecca Smart, who additionally depicted Cherie in the first stage generation, was the main individual to repeat their job from the play. "Blackrock" is frequently viewed as Heath Ledger's introduction film, however he had an uncredited minor job in the 1991 film "Playing Around". While Ledger's job in "Blackrock" is little, it is credited with earning him consideration in Australia, prompting progressively unmistakable acting jobs. 15-year-old Bojana Novakovic was given the job of Tracy somewhat on the grounds that she was an aggressive athlete and was considered rationally and physically sufficiently able to film the assault scene. Vidler talked about the job with her folks before taping initiated, who in spite of introductory reservations, in the end gave consent for her to film the scene. Novakovic said the experience was awful and she started to tremble wildly once the shoot finished, however recouped in a matter of seconds a while later, closing, "As it were, I feel fortunate to have had such a job toward the start of my vocation. I don't think I'll ever be terrified by an enthusiastic scene again." The young men engaged with the scene appeared at her entryway the next day and gave her a cluster of blooms and a T-shirt that said "crap occurs". Vidler said he found the execution so ground-breaking that when he originally watched the surges of the scene alone, he burst into tears. 

The soundtrack to the film was discharged on 28 April 1997 on Mercury Records Australia. Vidler said a great deal of time was spend filtering through hundred of CDs "attempting to discover stuff that was suitable for the film as well as request the gatherings of people and ideally, you know, would be discharged around a similar time as the film, which isn't as simple as it sounds!" Jonathan Lewis from "AllMusic" gave the collection four and a half out of five stars, reasoning that it was "A fine accumulation of tunes that, given the assorted variety of craftsmen included, is shockingly firm as a collection." 

The film appeared at the Sundance Film Festival on 24 January 1997. It was likewise appeared at the Boston Film Festival in September 1997. The adaptation of the film appeared outside Australia was around 100 minutes in length; after inspecting this form the Australian Classification Board gave it a 'R' rating, expressing the assault scene was "excessively nerve racking and going up against" for a MA15+ rating. Vidler in this manner cut around 10 minutes of film out of the film so it could get a MA15+ rating and achieve its intended interest group of 15-to 18-year-olds. "Blackrock" opened in films in Australia on 1 May 1997. It netted $1,136,983 at the Australian film industry. 

Fully expecting the film's presentation at Sundance, John Brodie from "Assortment" said the film could be the "roar from Down Under the way "Sparkle" was a year ago." Having watched the film at Sundance, David Rooney from "Assortment" applauded a few of the on-screen characters' exhibitions and said the film "should score with children the heroes' age, however its cleanser musical drama style plotting and overwritten exchange will constrain more extensive acknowledgment". "Debut" likewise gave a negative audit of the film's introduction, remarking that groups of onlookers had been hoping to see another "Sparkle", however left the screening frustrated. Elfick recognized that the underlying screening of "Blackrock" at Sundance was less generally welcomed, which he accused on sound issues. He expressed that the issue was amended for the second and third screenings, which were considerably more fruitful. Diane Carmen of "The Denver Post" gave the film a positive audit of the film, which she said left gatherings of people at Sundance "reeling with its power", finishing up it was "nearly ensured to discover a wholesaler in the U.S", however in the occasion the film never gotten American conveyance. Having seen the film at the Boston Film Festival, Chris Wright from "The Phoenix" finished up, "Even with its marginally absurd dÃ©nouement, "Blackrock" is a credible, contacting teenager dramatization. It's likewise a holding spine chiller". 

R.S. Murthi from the Malaysian paper "New Straits Times" gave the film two out of five stars, finishing up it is "an unflattering however fairly constrained take a gander at the wild side of adolescent life that now and again appears to be perilously tolerant of over the top teenager conduct." Associate teacher Donna Lee Brien of Central Queensland University said that when appeared outside Australia, the film comes up short on the "piercing and incredible account backing of Leigh's catastrophe" and was esteemed by commentators to be "shallow and stereotypical". 

Australian author and faultfinder Robert Drewe gave a positive survey, commending the execution of Breuls, the cinematography by Martin McGrath, and chief Steven Vidler's decision of such a dubious subject for a first film. After taking note of that the movie producers purposely demanded that their characters be depicted as not quite the same as the genuine individuals engaged with the Leigh murder as would be prudent, Drewe said the film is "soliciting a great deal from Australian gatherings of people to cancel reality from their recollections", however he inferred that the film ought to be "mandatory review for every single Australian young person." Rob Lowing from "The Sun-Herald" noticed that the film had a place with a huge number of Australasian movies that concentrated on white collar class life and eventually gave the film 3Â½ stars out of 4, expressing, "in the event that you went to see "Romper Stomper", "Metal Skin", "Moron Box" or "Once Were Warriors", this lumpy, punchy social dramatization capably fits into that class." 

In her book "Who Killed Leigh?", Kerry Carrington, a criminologist and unmistakable analyst of Leigh's homicide, had both analysis and applause for the film. She adulated it for dissipating "the legend" that sexual viciousness is kept to one social class, for delineating how young men demonstrate their sexual lead on their dads' treatment of ladies, and how the way of life of sex isolation in work environments can continue into the open existence of a town, worsening misogynist convictions and practices. She condemned the film, in any case, for the "solid impression" it makes that inadequate moms are a piece of the fundamental issue and for a few contrasts between Leigh's homicide and the film that she viewed as insolent to Leigh's memory, specifically the film's "Hollywood consummation". 

Donna Lee Brien expressed that similarly as the producers endeavored to separate themselves from Leigh's homicide, the city of Newcastle endeavored to remove itself from "Blackrock". A 1999 component in "The Sydney Morning Herald" talking about true to life creation in Newcastle referenced everything from Mel Gibson's 1977 introduction film "Summer City" to a short film celebration that year, however made no notice of "Blackrock". Brien conjectured that a portion of the judgment the film got may have been because of open dissatisfaction with the lawful framework, as the film accomplishes equity for the person in question, though nobody was ever sentenced for assaulting Leigh. Brien refered to the film for instance of why affectability and care must be taken while fictionalizing a real wrongdoing. 

A district 1 DVD was discharged on 29 October 2002 containing the first form of the film. A locale 4 DVD was discharged on 19 November 2003 containing the altered variant. Extraordinary highlights incorporated a four-minute featurette, cast and group meets, a 'goof reel' which included film of a holding trip made by Simon Lyndon, Laurence Bruels and Cameron Nugent to Lennox Head, and the film's unique trailer and TV ad. As per Andrew L. Urban from Urban Cinefile the featurette was "overburdened" with clasps from the film, however was generally of intrigue. Urban additionally applauded the seven-minute meeting with Nick Enright. 

None of the limited time material for the film referenced Leigh and the film was not advertised as being "founded on a genuine story". The film's credits express that it is a work of fiction and that similarity to "real occasions or people living or dead is altogether adventitious". By the by, various correlations between the film and Leigh's homicide were made. Much the same as the play it depended on, "Blackrock" was regularly erroneously considered by watchers to be a true record of Leigh's homicide. Conflation between the two subjects was high; the film was portrayed by Miriam Davis on radio station "FM 91.5" similar to the genuine story of "the homicide of Leigh Warner at Blackrock Beach close Newcastle." Donna Lee Brien expressed that each audit of both the film and the play it depended on at any rate referenced Leigh, with some expounding regarding the matter. Kerry Carrington expressed that the film was precise in certain parts of the homicide, yet far off in others, as though the film was "having a wagered every way". 

Jared is a totally anecdotal character, however he has been translated as a representation for everybody who saw Leigh being openly struck yet did nothing. In the film, Tracy does not approach her folks for consent to go to the gathering as she probably is aware this would be denied, though Leigh acquired authorization from her folks, who were told the gathering would be directed. Tracy wears a short skirt, tight-fitting top, and wedged-heels to the gathering, while Leigh wore common shorts, a jumper, and sand-shoes. Tracy's body is discovered that night by a young lady; Leigh's body was discovered the following day by a kid. Tracy's mom packs up her little girl's room the next day, while Leigh's mom left her room immaculate for a considerable length of time. In the film, police work until each kid associated with the assault and murder is rebuffed, while nobody was sentenced for assaulting Leigh and police got analysis for supposed inadequacy. Tracy's killer was 22 years of age, very much conditioned, and ended it all, while Leigh's was 18 years of age, , and was imprisoned. 

The two killers, in any case, were secondary school dropouts who were keen on mechanics, were considered to have no passionate profundity, and were inclined to savagery. The gathering in the film was viewed as "a practically immaculate re-creation" of the gathering in Stockton; a surf club is employed for the night with young participants being engaged by a secondary school band. The gathering spills out into the encompassing zone where there are battles, and youngsters are seen lurching, heaving and oblivious. Tracy's burial service was additionally viewed as "an immediate re-arranging" of Leigh's administration; both Leigh and Tracy's companions set red roses on her pine box and after that plant a tree in her memory. Both Leigh and Tracy's moms worked at a nursing home and both their dads required capital punishment for her killer. Guardians are accused for ignoring their youngsters in the two cases. 

Subtleties that were viewed as without a doubt taken from Leigh's homicide incorporated the taping area of Stockton, the nearness of the melody "On the off chance that I Could Turn Back Time" highlighted at Leigh's burial service showing up in the first content (however it didn't show up in the completed film), and blurbs perusing "Disgrace Blackrock Shame" seen on telephone poles following Tracy's homicide; publications showed up around Stockton following Leigh's homicide expressing "Disgrace Stockton Shame: Dob the gutless rats in". 

"Blackrock" got five selections at the 1997 AACTA Awards, however did not win any honors. It won both the 'Element FilmÂ â Adaptation' grant and the Major Award at the 1997 AWGIE Awards.
