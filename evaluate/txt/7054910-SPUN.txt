At the beginning of World War II, Hardman was sent to France with the RAF component of the British Expeditionary Force. After the Fall of France in 1940, he served on the base camp staff of No.Â 22 Group and was contact officer with the British Army's Eastern Command, before assuming responsibility for the Directorate of Military Co-activityâlater the Directorate of Operations (Tactical)â at the Air Ministry. He was selected an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 11Â July 1940 for "recognized administrations rendered in late tasks", and referenced in despatches on 1Â January 1941. On 1Â March 1941, he was advanced impermanent gathering chief. 

Hardman was advanced transitory air commodore on 1Â October 1944, and substantive gathering chief on 1Â December. He was doled out to Air Command South East Asia (ACSEA) as the appointee officerâand RAF segment administratorâof the Combat Cargo Task Force (CCTF). Containing RAF, Royal Canadian Air Force, and United States Army Air Forces components, CCTF was in charge of providing the Fourteenth Army in Burma. Hardman's last wartime posting, initiating in February 1945, was as Air Officer Commanding No.Â 232 (Transport) Group in Comilla, India (presently Bangladesh). The gathering involved the squadrons that some time ago made up the RAF part of CCTF.

This has been South-East Asia's commitment to the craft of war."

On 14 January 1952, Hardman was named Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), succeeding Air Marshal George Jones, who had served ten years in the position. The choice by Australia's Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, to choose a RAF officer caused hatred in the RAAF. This was intensified when Menzies expressed his reason as being that there might have been "no RAAF officer of adequate age, or operational experience, to take the post of Chief of the Air Staff", which seemed to overlook the wartime records of such figures as John McCauley and Frederick Scherger. "The Daily Mirror" in Sydney was one of a few news sources to voice a "stern dissent" over the issue. Menzies additionally felt that he could legitimize the arrangement of a pariah in light of the fact that the RAAF's geologically based order and-control framework required revamping along utilitarian lines, a framework with which a senior RAF part would be recognizable. England's CAS, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Slessor, was, to some degree reluctantly, in charge of satisfying the Australian Government's solicitation for a reasonable officer. In advancing Hardman as the "exceptional applicant" for the Australian post, Slessor endeavored to maintain a strategic distance from what he called "the indiscretions of certain years prior", alluding to Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett's questionable residency as CAS on secondment from the RAF right off the bat in World WarÂ II. 

Hardman rolled out two noteworthy improvements to the structure of the Air Force to streamline direction and control: coordinating RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, with the Department of Air, and displacing the topographical territory directions with three practical associations, in particular Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. The practical direction framework has been depicted by history specialist Alan Stephens as Hardman's "real inheritance to the RAAF". While getting rid of the territory order structure that had been supported by Jones, Hardman carried on his ancestor's help for the neighborhood airplane industry. He likewise framed an approach concurrence with the Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Sir John Collins, covering joint obligation and participation for sea fighting. Amid Hardman's term as CAS, No.Â 78 (Fighter) Wing was re-furnished with RAF deÂ Havilland Vampire fly contenders to battalion Malta and bolster British activities in the Mediterranean. He was delegated a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the Queen's Birthday Honors declared on 5Â June 1952, and raised to substantive air marshal on 1Â July. 

As a protege of Slessor, Hardman declared: "An aviation based armed forces without aircraft isn't a flying corps". He kept up that the best way to achieve "genuine and suffering air prevalence" was by assaulting the adversary's crucial focuses, which incorporated its methods for delivering contenders. He suggested that the RAAF buy one of Britain's atomic skilled "V planes"â the Vickers Valiant, Handley Page Victor, or Avro Vulcanâhowever this never eventuated, and Australia's fly aircraft remained the English Electric Canberra until the since a long time ago postponed presentation of the General Dynamics F-111C in 1973. Towards the finish of his residency as CAS, Hardman gave a meeting in which he reprimanded Army and Navy activities against a scenery of proceeding with interservice competition for the safeguard spending plan. He was cited as saying: "The Air Force in this nation, for either barrier or offense, is the main power worth while. It tends to be sent anyplace on the planet to the point where it can do most great and be quickly changed to some other point." as opposed to the underlying anxiety at his arrangement, upon his takeoff from Australia Hardman was depicted by "The Age" as "the remarkable CAS in the RAAF's history", a "splendid coordinator", and an "ace of the hypothesis of air control". He was prevailing by McCauley on 18Â January 1954. 

Hardman came back to Britain on the SS "Himalaya", and joined the British Air Council as Air Member for Supply and Organization on 1Â May 1954, succeeding Air Chief Marshal Sir John Whitworth-Jones. In December, he spoke to the Air Council at No.Â 78 Wing's goodbye march in Malta, reminding the faculty assembled that he had been available at the wing's walk through Sydney in July 1952, preceding its flight for the Mediterranean. He was elevated to air boss marshal on 1Â April 1955. In July 1956, he exhibited a Squadron Standard to his old unit, No.Â 19 Squadron. That October, he managed the investigation into the deadly accident of Vulcan "XA897" at Heathrow Airport after its lady round-the-world flight, the main overcomers of the six team individuals being the pilot and Air Marshal Sir Harry Broadhurst. Hardman was prevailing as Air Member for Supply and Organization via Air Chief Marshal Sir Walter Dawson on 1Â January 1958, and was raised to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire that day. He resigned from the RAF on 29Â January.
