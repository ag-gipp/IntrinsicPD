History of the British penny (1901â 1970) 

The British penny ( of a pound sterling), an extensive, pre-decimal coin proceeding with the arrangement of pennies that started about the year 700, was struck discontinuously amid the twentieth century until its withdrawal after 1970. All through the period 1901 to 1970, the front ("heads" side) of the bronze coin delineated the ruler who was ruling toward the beginning of the year. The invert highlighted a picture of Britannia situated with shield, trident, and steerage, initially made by Leonard Charles Wyon and dependent on a prior structure for the penny by his dad William Wyon. The coins additionally were utilized in domains and British provinces that had not issued their very own coins. 

The turn around configuration had in 1895 been adjusted by Engraver of the Royal Mint George William de Saulles. Following Queen Victoria's passing in 1901, de Saulles was called upon to make a structure for the front-side highlighting Edward VII. This showed up on the penny in 1902, and stayed being used until the time of King Edward's demise, 1910. A front-side plan by Sir Bertram Mackennal delineating George V went into utilization in 1911, and stayed with some change until the time of the King's demise, 1936. No pennies were delivered for business in 1933, as there were an adequate number available for use. No less than seven were struck that year, for the most part for position underneath establishment stones and in galleries; they are significant today. Edward VIII's short rule is just spoken to by a solitary example coin, dated 1937. That year, another front structure delineating George VI by Humphrey Paget went into utilization. Amid the Second World War time of 1941 to 1943, pennies were struck just for the states; these are altogether dated 1940, the latest year of generation for the United Kingdom. After the war, interest for the penny started to lessen. The vast majority of the 1950 and 1951 pieces were sent to Bermuda, with many recovered from flow and repatriated by British coin vendors in view of their relative shortage. 

Despite the fact that trade did not require them, pennies bearing the similarity of Elizabeth II were printed in 1953 in sets sold to the general population, utilizing a front-side structure by Mary Gillick. One 1954 penny was struck, for inside Mint purposes. By 1961, new pennies were required again for course, and were created in vast numbers. The authorities who arranged decimalisation during the 1960s did not support keeping the extensive bronze penny, whose esteem had been disintegrated by expansion. The keep going for course were dated 1967âa last evidence set was dated 1970. The old penny rapidly left use after Decimal Day, 15 February 1971 - there was no definite decimal proportional, and the motto "utilize your old pennies in sixpenny parts" clarified that pennies and "threepenny bits" were possibly acknowledged in shops if the complete esteem was six old pence (precisely 2 1/2 new pence). The old penny was demonetised on 31 August of that year. 

Following the demise of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901, authorities at the Royal Mint made arrangements for new coins, to shoulder the picture of her child and successor, Edward VII. New coin plans had been presented during the 1890s, and Mint authorities trusted the British individuals needed as few changes to the coinage as could be expected under the circumstances. Subsequently, it was chosen not to change the turns around of the three bronze coins (the penny, halfpenny and farthing), as another representation of the Queen had been presented in 1895. Around then, the Engraver of the Royal Mint, George William de Saulles, had changed Leonard Charles Wyon's delineation of Britannia on the turn around of the bronze coinsâthe beacon and cruising ship that had flanked her were expelled. De Saulles was entrusted with making a portrayal of Edward for the King's new coinage. The Mint kept on striking coins portraying Victoria, dated 1901, until the King's coinage was prepared in May 1902. 

The King sat for de Saulles twice, in February and June 1901, and the etcher additionally utilized an illustration of Edward by court painter Emil Fuchs. The unadorned bust of the King that came about is in low alleviation, as de Saulles looked for a coin that would be simple for the Royal Mint to strike. All things being equal, the generally vast size of the head caused metal stream issues for the penny once issued, bringing about "ghosting", a black out layout of the front structure obvious on the turn around. On 20 August 1901, the Mint got affirmation that the de Saulles bust of Edward would be utilized on all coins. The new bronze coins were made current by a declaration dated 10 December 1901, viable 1 January 1902. 

Edward's pennies are to a similar standard as the last Victorian issues: 95 percent copper, 4 percent tin and 1 percent zinc, and, similar to every single bronze penny from 1860 until 1970, they gauge a normal of and have a distance across of 1.2 inches (30.81 mm). The head faces directly on the Edward VII coins, with the engraving . The invert demonstrates the situated Britannia encompassed by , with the date at the base of the coin; this structure remained to a great extent unaltered until the coin's downfall after 1970. Pennies were hit with Edward's bust from 1902 to 1910. There are two assortments on 1902-dated pennies, "high tide" and "low tide", because of a choice to raise the obvious water level around Britannia. 

The demise of de Saulles in 1903 had prompted the cancelation of the post of Engraver, and coins for George V, who took the honored position on Edward's passing in 1910, were liable to a structure rivalry won by Bertram Mackennal, who likewise arranged the decoration for the Coronation. The King obviously loved his work, as he was selected a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1911 and knighted in 1921. The engraving around the left-confronting bust peruses , while no huge change was made to the switch plan. The new bronze coins were made current by decree dated 28 November 1910, viable 1 January 1911. 

Notwithstanding those struck at the Royal Mint, in 1912, 1918 and 1919 a few pennies were created at the Heaton Mint in Birmingham, and are recognized by a "H" mint imprint to one side of the date. In 1918 and 1919 some were delivered at the Kings Norton Metal Co. Ltd, likewise in Birmingham, and have a "KN" there. The two firms likewise given spaces to the Royal Mint for striking into pennies from 1912 to 1919. This was because of extreme interest for little change, at first brought about by the 1911 execution of the National Insurance Act by the Asquith government, and from that point by the war years. Likewise nourishing the interest for pennies were programmed opening machines, a pattern saw as right on time as 1898. To lessen the quantity of worn pieces in trade, the Royal Mint had in 1908 consented to acknowledge the arrival of worn pre-1895 pennies and halfpennies through banks and post workplaces, and from 1922, pieces dated 1860 to 1894 would be reclaimed in any condition, however they stayed adequate available for use. The pre-1860 copper penny had been demonetised after 1869 in Britain (however acknowledged at full assumed worth by the Mint until 1873) and in 1877 for the states. 

Lord George's pennies were delivered in a similar combination as before until 1922, however the next year the piece of bronze coins was set at 95.5 percent copper, 3 percent tin, and 1.5 percent zinc, despite the fact that the weight stayed at and the measurement 1.2 inches (31 millimeters). This amalgam was marginally increasingly pliable; the diminished power expected to strike pennies limited ghosting. No pennies were struck for the years 1923, 1924 or 1925; this was because of absence of interest as the interwar years saw substituting excesses and deficiencies of pennies. In 1928, the King's picture was decreased in size, successfully wiping out the ghosting issue. The engraving around the three varieties of the left-confronting head remained , while Britannia stayed on the invert, as previously, however that plan was marginally altered in 1922. 

Before the finish of George's rule, in 1936, the bronze penny, which had felt lighter in weight contrasted and more established coppers when the compound was first utilized for it in 1860, was viewed as profound and lumbering, the heaviest bronze coin available for use in Europe. The weight when in mass caused issues for business; the London Passenger Transport Board got 6,000 tons of pennies, halfpennies and farthings a year. A decrease of size for the penny was regarded unfeasible, since time is running short it would take to recoin the 3,000,000,000 pennies available for use, and on the grounds that numerous programmed machines that took pennies would need to be reconfigured. The real reaction would be the 1937 presentation of the metal threepence coin. This twelve-sided piece was presented since threepence worth of pennies or halfpennies was substantial and badly designed, and the silver threepenny piece was esteemed excessively little. 

There was no requirement for the Mint to deliver any pennies in 1933 on the grounds that there was no business request, and it had sufficient stocks from earlier years away. There was a custom around then for the King to put a lot of coins of the present year under the establishment stone of critical new structures, and the Mint struck three 1933 pennies for this reason, likewise one each for its own historical center and for the British Museum, and something like two others. The outcome was an irregularity that individuals thought may turn up in their pocket change, and that is likely the best-known British uncommon coin. 

The exact number struck was not recorded at the time; seven are known to exist. One of the 1933 pennies sold in 2016 for US $193,875 (Â£149,364 at the time). The realized 1933 pennies are to be found in the Royal Mint Museum, the British Museum, under the Senate House of the University of London (put there by King George in 1933), with three now in private accumulations, and one that was stolen, its whereabouts obscure. The missing coin was put in 1933 under the establishment stone of Church of St Cross, Middleton, Leeds; it was stolen in August 1970 amid the congregation's reproduction, by cheats who figured out how to expel the arrangement of coins from underneath the congregation. To avoid conceivable further burglary, John Moorman, Bishop of Ripon, requested that the 1933 penny put under St Mary's Church, Hawksworth Wood, Kirkstall, Leeds, be uncovered and sold, which it was. To the extent is known, the penny under Senate House is still set up. Two others in private hands were sold at sales in 1969 and 2016 individually. 

Four example coins were likewise made, bearing comparative plans to official coins yet arranged by stone carver AndrÃ© Lavrillier at the Royal Mint's solicitation. These were dismissed by the Standing Committee on Coins, Medals and Decorations in December 1932. One sold at closeout on 4 May 2016 for Â£72,000. 

No coins of King Edward VIII (1936) were formally issued, however a penny exists, dated 1937. It is an example coin, one delivered for regal endorsement which it would most likely have been expected to get about the time that the King resigned. The front, by Humphrey Paget, demonstrates a left-confronting representation of the King, who believed this to be his best side, and wished to break the custom of exchanging with each alter of reign the course in which the ruler faces on coins. The engraving on the front is . 

At the point when the Royal Mint's Advisory Committee were thinking about the subject of new structures for King Edward's coinage, they didn't support another search for the penny. Or maybe, they looked for the arrival of the beacon and ship, found out there on either side of Britannia on pre-1895 pennies, yet with the cruising ship seen on Victorian pennies supplanted with an advanced warship. Authorities felt this excessively forceful at a fragile worldwide time, and the ship was not reestablished, however the beacon was set on Edward's examples, and would be kept on the penny until its nullification after 1970. 

Lord George VI's new coins were made current by an announcement dated 18 March 1937, which went into power right away. In spite of the fact that the standard Britannia theme was held for the penny, the halfpenny and farthing were given their own plans. 

George's pennies (1937â 1952) have a left-confronting bust of him, additionally by Paget, with the engraving (to 1948) , and (from 1949) , evacuating the Latin shortening for "Ruler of India" after that country had picked up autonomy. Pennies were delivered for dissemination dated 1937â 1940, and 1944â 1951, in spite of the fact that when fundamental pennies were created for the provinces in 1941â 1943 utilizing the 1940 passes on. These went mainly to Gibraltar and the British West Indies. 

In spite of the fact that the 2000 release of the Coincraft inventory of British coins says the wartime stop was because of an excess of pennies, numismatist Kerry Rodgers, in his 2016 article on the cash crisis in Fiji amid the Second World War, refered to a pioneer authoritative record such that it was to monitor copper for weapons. Starting with the 1942 generation of 1940-dated pennies, the structure was changed, as tin was a basic war material, uncommon in light of the fact that the majority of it originated from Malaya, so pennies from that point until some other time in 1945 are 97 percent copper, 0.5 percent tin, and 2.5 percent zinc. Such coins stain to a shading unique in relation to the prewar coins, and they were treated with sodium thiosulphate to give them a darker tone. That substance, named "hypo", had been utilized to obscure every one of the 1934 pennies before issue and the vast majority of the 1935 mintage, "Hypo" would be utilized again in 1946, staining the coins to demoralize the storing of new pennies. Despite the fact that the prewar compound was reestablished in 1945, the Mint turned around itself in 1959, made pennies out of that wartime structure for the rest of the coin's pre-decimal history without concoction treatment, and proceeded with its utilization for the new decimal bronze pieces. 

By the late 1940s, interest for pennies was falling in Britain, likely because of the ubiquity of the lighter, progressively helpful, metal threepence coin. which weighed not exactly a fourth of a similar incentive in bronze coins. The prompt outcome of the war had seen a solid interest for pennies until January 1949, when it dropped off, and in May of that year, the Royal Mint ceased the coin's generation. Authorities inferred that the fall sought after was changeless because of expansion; its obtaining power was insignificant, and numerous programmed machines never again took it. The Royal Mint reclaimed surplus coppers from the banks for liquefying starting in 1951, and before the decade's over, some Â£1.2 million worth had been expelled from course. 

The 1950 and 1951 course pennies were delivered for the provinces as none were required in Britain. Amid 1956, the whole 1950 mintage (still held in stock in Britain) and 75% of the 1951 creation were sent to Bermuda. The two mintages were low contrasted and before George VI pennies, and London vendors slid on the islands, offering a pound a coin. Gathering coins by date (particularly the penny) wound up mainstream in the mid 1960s; after numerous striking cases about the speculation capability of the 1951 penny were made, the coin gained something of a clique status. One 1952 penny accepted to be one of a kind was struck by the Royal Mint. 

The arrangement of pennies worth of a pound closes with the pre-decimalisation issues for Queen Elizabeth II. No real change was made to the turn around plans of the penny or other bronze coins with the new rule, and her coins were made current by a declaration of 25 November 1952, powerful 1 January 1953. No pennies were struck for dissemination in 1953, the main surviving group between the farthing and half crown not to see a flow issue. This was a direct result of the extensive number of pennies available for use. Example sets, including the penny, were issued for the Queen's Coronation that year, with the front-side of each coin recorded around the right-confronting bust of the Queen by Mary Gillick. These were not issued for flow, however as the example sets were sold for just a slight development on presumptive worth, many were later torn open and spent. In all consequent mintings of the penny, the engraving was . The erasure of the Latin for "Ruler of the considerable number of Britains" for assigning her just as "Ruler" was because of the changing idea of the British Commonwealth, which by then incorporated a few republics. 

One 1954 penny is known, struck for bite the dust testing purposes at the Royal Mint, and expected for liquefying, however recouped from flow. Before the finish of the 1950s, the cost of metal guaranteed that each bronze coin was struck at a misfortune; the Mint sought after a decrease in size, and the demonetisation of the farthing toward the finish of 1960 helped make room for such a plan. It was not until 1961 that there was a requirement for more pennies to be stamped, and generation proceeded with every year in exceptionally huge numbers until the last pre-decimal pennies for dissemination, dated 1967, were begat. 

The old bronze penny was slated for end as decimal money was arranged during the 1960s. It kept on being struck after 1967, as yet bearing that date. The 97 percent copper, 0.5 percent tin, 2.5 percent zinc combination was utilized again for the 1960s pennies. At last, there was an issue of evidence quality currencies dated 1970 for authorities, to say goodbye to a division which had served the nation well for a long time. The longstanding portrayal of Britannia on the penny was deciphered by stone worker Christopher Ironside to the post-decimal fifty-pence coin. 

The Decimal Currency Board had foreseen the requirement for a progress of as long as year and a half after Decimal Day, 15 February 1971, however the "old penny" immediately disappeared from flow, and it was made no longer lawful delicate after 31 August 1971. It had been the last overcomer of the three bronze coins, as the halfpenny had been pulled back in 1969. With decimalisation the new penny conveyed an estimation of 1/100 of a pound.
