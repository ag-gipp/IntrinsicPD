In the wake of holding the Confederations Cup in 2009, Gilberto communicated his craving to drag out his club vocation, which harmonized with restricted playing time for Brazil, provoking his retirement from universal challenge preceding the 2010 FIFA World Cup, subsequent to gathering 93 appearances for the side. 

Gilberto filled in as specialized executive at Panathinaikos in 2016. 

As a youngster, Gilberto lived in the city of Lagoa da Prata with his dad (a metal forger), his mom (a housewife) and three sisters. His family lived in a little house which his dad worked, in the area of Usina LuciÃ¢nia. In spite of money related hardship, making his sisters and him share a solitary room, he had a moderately lighthearted youth: he portrays it as "[a time when] I had no duty in my life, I played football in the city with cousins and companions, and we never had any contact with medications or viciousness". In 1988 (matured 12), he found the opportunity to break out of neediness by playing football, joining AmÃ©rica Mineiro as a young player. It was amid these years at AmÃ©rica Mineiro that Gilberto was shown cautious order by playing as a focal protector. At the point when not playing football, Gilberto was shown furniture-production aptitudes by his dad, which he would come to use in the next years. In 1991, Gilberto's dad resigned leaving the 15-year-old to give monetarily to his entire family, an errand made progressively troublesome by his mom's evil wellbeing. 

In view of the low compensation at AmÃ©rica Mineiro, he was compelled to stop football to accept different employments as a worker, a woodworker, and a laborer in a sweet processing plant. It looked as though this would be the finish of his youth dream. As an assembly line laborer Gilberto earned what might be compared to about Â£50 every month by 2002 rates. Following three years of working in a processing plant, the 18-year-old chose to attempt his karma at football again by joining up with the nearby club's childhood foundation. His time in the foundation did not keep going long because of the compounding circumstance at home because of his mom's evil wellbeing; he came back to work in the sweet industrial facility with little any desire for restoring his football vocation. 

In 1997, Gilberto's companions persuaded him to give football another attempt, which prompted him re-marking for AmÃ©rica Mineiro on 1 June 1997, this time as a full-time proficient. Matured 22, Gilberto played as a focal safeguard for the principal group. Amid his first season for AmÃ©rica Mineiro he was viewed as a key player by the club, in spite of being reprimanded by certain fans for irregularity. He helped them win the SÃ©rie B division, and thusly gain advancement to SÃ©rie A. 

Amid Gilberto's third season at AmÃ©rica Mineiro, with the group back to SÃ©rie B after transfer in SÃ©rie An of every 1999, he played 20 diversions and scored one objective, helping the club to wrap sprinters up in the association. In 2000, matured 24, he joined opponent club AtlÃ©tico Mineiro. In his first season for the club, he broke his correct tibia and, thus, missed various recreations. In his second season, he was moved by the supervisor Carlos Alberto Parreira from focal safeguard to a guarded midfield job where he prospered. He scored three objectives in the 2001 season and turned into a disclosure in Brazilian club football. 

Gilberto's execution in the 2002 FIFA World Cup grabbed the eye of numerous mentors. Gilberto communicated a craving to move to England, saying, "It is awesome to play against any semblance of David Beckham once more." thus, FA Premier League clubs Aston Villa and Arsenal drove the pursuit to sign him. In August, while still under contract to AtlÃ©tico Mineiro, Gilberto joined Arsenal on their pre-season voyage through Austria; while he had not yet marked for Arsenal the arrangement looked set to proceed. Be that as it may, inconveniences emerged when an exchange ban was set on AtlÃ©tico Mineiro because of unpaid wages to certain players at the club, including Gilberto. There was additionally an issue of acquiring a UK work license for Gilberto. Regardless of the difficulties, Gilberto finished a mid year of hypothesis and joined Arsenal on 7 August 2002 for an expense of Â£4.5Â million. After marking Gilberto, Arsenal supervisor ArsÃ¨ne Wenger stated, "What I like was the way that he kept things straightforward. He can play all over the midfield however the holding job just before the safeguard is the thing that he does best." 

At the point when Gilberto moved to England and started preparing with Arsenal, he purchased a house in St Albans, South Hertfordshire. Having been utilized to life in little Brazilian towns, he at first attempted to adjust to the better approach for life in London. In any case, on the pitch, he settled in all respects rapidly. On 11 August 2002 he made his Arsenal debut as a substitute against Liverpool in the second 50% of the FA Community Shield amusement in which he scored the triumphant objective. As the 2002â 03 FA Premier League season started, Gilberto confronted firm challenge for a spot in midfield from comrade Edu. After two substitute appearances, Gilberto at last broke into the beginning eleven on 27 August, helping Arsenal to a 5â 2 success against West Bromwich Albion. Gilberto's great structure proceeded as he set another record for the quickest objective scored in the UEFA Champions League, scoring after 20.07 seconds against PSV on 25 September 2002. In any case, his legitimate issues proceeded, since his exchange to England still was not completely settled. Subsequently, Gilberto trained his legal advisors to begin legitimate procedures against AtlÃ©tico Mineiro for unpaid wages in November 2002. For the second 50% of the 2002â 03 season, he remained a normal starter in the Arsenal side. Despite the fact that he endured a pass in structure towards the finish of the period, he won a FA Cup champ's award, playing in the last at the Millennium Stadium as Arsenal beat Southampton 1â 0. 

2003â 04 was a far and away superior season for Gilberto, as he was instrumental in helping Arsenal win the Premier League title while going the whole season unbeaten. He played in 32 of Arsenal's 38 unbeaten Premier League amusements amid the season. His next season began similarly stunningly, as he scored the primary objective in Arsenal's 3â 1 Community Shield prevail upon Manchester United at the Millennium Stadium. Amid the opening rounds of the period, he began to encounter serious torment in his back, and after a match at Bolton Wanderers on 27 September 2004, an output uncovered he had cracked his back. At first it was accounted for that he would be out of activity for a month. Later reports proposed the damage could be season-undermining. 

Gilberto's specialist requested him to wear a back support for three months to help the mending of the broke bone. Gilberto came back to his local Brazil for the term of his restoration. Amid his time there, he questioned whether he could ever have the capacity to play football again, because of hypothesis that his damage could compromise his profession. Regardless of his worries, his long restoration time satisfied as he made a full recuperation. He made his footballing rebound in Arsenal's 4â 1 triumph over Norwich City on 22 April 2005. Amid the entire 2004â 05 season, Gilberto was harmed for 7 months and played just 17 diversions. His nonattendance, joined with Arsenal's droop in structure at the time, prompted much discourse in regards to the significance of Gilberto to the Arsenal group; some proposing that Arsenal battled without him. Gilberto's troublesome 2004â 05 season finished in relief as Arsenal wrapped sprinters up in the Premier League and won the FA Cup against Manchester United in a punishment shoot-out. 

In June 2005, football specialist Jacques Lichtenstein indicted AtlÃ©tico Mineiro over Gilberto's move in 2002. Lichtenstein's legal advisor contended that he and his casual accomplice, Ronny Rosenthal, never got a purportedly concurred 10% commission from Gilberto's Â£4.5Â million exchange to Arsenal from AtlÃ©tico Mineiro in July 2002. ArsÃ¨ne Wenger and Arsenal bad habit executive David Dein both gave proof in court, saying that Arsenal managed AtlÃ©tico Mineiro and that no operator was engaged with the arrangement. The case was directed before The Hon. Mr Justice Jack, who on 29 June ruled against Lichtenstein, and requested the petitioners pay Atletico MinÃ©iro Â£94,000 in legitimate expenses. After a year, the case could have caused issues for Arsenal, when previous player Ashley Cole scrutinized the club for "deception and twofold norms" in the manner in which they drew closer Gilberto. 

With legitimate issues died down, the 2005â 06 season started. Following midfielder and group skipper Patrick Vieira's takeoff from Arsenal, Gilberto turned into a senior individual from the Arsenal group. In the blink of an eye into the season, in September 2005, his longing to see his vocation out with the club prompted Gilberto stretching out his Arsenal contract to June 2009. After a month this unwaveringness was reimbursed when, on 18 October 2005, Gilberto showed up for Arsenal as skipper, against Sparta Prague. In spite of the fact that Gilberto had a time of inappropriate behavior amid the winter a long time of the period, his great guarded exhibitions amid the last phases of the UEFA Champions League (specifically, recreations against Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal) picked up him acclaim. On 17 May 2006 Gilberto played for Arsenal in the UEFA Champions League Final against FC Barcelona, which Arsenal lost 2â 1. 

Following the takeoff of protector Sol Campbell and retirement of striker Dennis Bergkamp in the late spring of 2006, Gilberto was declared as Arsenal's bad habit chief for the 2006â 07 season. He started the season well, as he scored the first since forever objective at the Dutch DSB Stadion in a pre-season benevolent match. He at that point scored Arsenal's first historically speaking objective in an aggressive match at the Emirates Stadium in a 1â 1 draw with Aston Villa. His great structure proceeded for Arsenal as he scored a few group objectives, collecting acclaim for his exhibitions as remain in skipper while Thierry Henry was harmed. Gilberto and his operator (Paulo Villana) likewise repeated the player's longing to respect his agreement with the Gunners. Then, Gilberto's great structure brought through to the second 50% of the period. Despite the fact that Arsenal just figured out how to complete fourth in the association, he finished the season as Arsenal's second most astounding scorer with 10 Premier League objectives. The clarification for his bizarrely high count is the way that Henry endured two long damage spells, in which Gilberto ventured up as chief to take punishments. Gilberto's objective scoring record joined with his very own great structure in midfield and his administration of Wenger's young squad drove some Arsenal fans and football intellectuals to name Gilberto as Arsenal's best player of the period, and a standout amongst the best in the Premier League. 

The development of the 2007â 08 season saw Arsenal skipper Thierry Henry leave the club to join Barcelona. This combined with the way that Gilberto was Arsenal's bad habit chief amid the 2006â 07 season drove numerous individuals to expect that Gilberto would assume control over Henry's job. Be that as it may, to the astonishment of Gilberto, William Gallas was given the commander's armband. In August, subsequent to coming back to Arsenal's pre-season preparing late because of his association in the Copa AmÃ©rica competition (and along these lines missing the beginning of the period), Gilberto then lost his place in the main group to youthful midfielder Mathieu Flamini. This reignited theory connecting Gilberto to Italy because of bits of gossip that he was miserable being on the seat at Arsenal. Be that as it may, reports that he was being reprimanded at the club were expelled by Wenger, who demanded that Gilberto would stay at Arsenal to battle for his place. In spite of this, in October 2007, gossipy tidbits in the press re-rose that Gilberto resented Wenger for being approached to play in barrier in a League Cup amusement against Sheffield United, and had resultantly would not play. Gilberto wound up playing the amusement in midfield however, with he and Wenger both precluding gossipy tidbits from claiming a break with one another. Gilberto hence remarked that while he was upset being a substitute, he would stay proficient and battle for his place at the club. Additionally in October, Gilberto surrendered the Brazilian captaincy to LÃºcio upon his countryman's arrival from damage. 

Through the winter a very long time of the 2007â 08 season, Gilberto began a predetermined number of amusements for the "Heavy weapons specialists", however he kept his place in the Brazil group, beginning a few diversions for "A SeleÃ§Ã£o". Subsequent to ending up increasingly more baffled with not playing normally, Gilberto conceded in February 2008 that he had been made to feel "absolutely pointless" by Wenger. Regardless of this, he declined to settle on a choice on his future; something which provoked Wenger to guarantee chats with Gilberto. In the midst of Gilberto's dissatisfaction at Arsenal, he focused on playing in Brazil's Olympic group in Beijing amid August 2008; a challenge which he had never played in. Off the pitch, Gilberto was accounted for to have breezed through his UK Citizenship test, and that he would in this way apply for a British identification. April saw Gilberto's season improve; making 5 begins â a significant segment of his occasional aggregate of 12 â notwithstanding figuring out how to score an objective. The objective came against Reading on 19 April, and regardless of its deflective nature prompting some classing it as a conceivable possess objective, the Premier League's Dubious Goals Committee in the long run attributed the objective to Gilberto. Be that as it may, Gilberto's arrival to support did not stop Arsenal's 2007â 08 season closure trophyless. The club in this way confronted the likelihood of a few players leaving; among those supposed to leave was Flamini, the player who had kept Gilberto out of the principal group. The Frenchman wound up moving to A.C. Milan on 6 May, and a consequent hole was left in the Arsenal midfield. Gilberto turned out to be more averse to leave the club amid Summer 2008 therefore, and Wenger commented that he needed to keep Gilberto; Gilberto saying he needed to remain and perhaps even restore his agreement at Arsenal. Gilberto completed the 2007â 08 season with 36 appearances for Arsenal, yet just 12 of these being Premier League begins. 

Following Brazil's mid year global recreations, he was truly connected with a move to Greek club Panathinaikos. The theory finished up when Gilberto concurred terms with the Athenian side on 17 July 2008, for an undisclosed charge. Amid his first season at the club, Gilberto helped the side achieve the UEFA Champions League Round of 16. He figured out how to win both the 2009â 10 Greek Championship and Cup with Panathinaikos, being the beginning holding midfielder and delivering various strong showcases. In Gilberto's last home amusement for Panathinaikos on 23 May 2011, he scored the triumphant objective in a 1â 0 triumph over PAOK, for the Greek UEFA Champions League playoffs. After two days, he played his last diversion for the group, winning 2â 0 against AEK Athens. 

On 23 May 2011, Gilberto finished his 9-year vocation in Europe by marking a 18-month manage GrÃªmio, of Porto Alegre. 

Before, Gilberto indicated that he may one day come back to Brazil to play for AtlÃ©tico Mineiro. After his football vocation completes, he has said that he might want to, "Live in a little ranch and ride a pony and have the majority of my family by me." On 10 November 2012, it was affirmed that Gilberto's desire would be in all actuality, as he marked a pre-contract with "Galo". 

On 9 December 2012, Gilberto was invited at Aeroporto dos Confins by enthusiasts of AtlÃ©tico Mineiro, coming back to the Belo Horizonte side following 11 years away. Gilberto talked about winning the 2013 Copa Libertadores title upon his arrival. Gilberto accomplished this desire on 24 July 2013, with a last triumph over Club Olimpia of Paraguay. 

On 11 December 2015, following two years without a club, he formally reported his retirement as a footballer, aiming to seek after a vocation as a universal advisor for clubs and players. 

In October 2001, his great exhibitions from that year earned Gilberto a call-up to the Brazilian national group (""A SeleÃ§Ã£o"") by Luiz Felipe Scolari for the 2002 World Cup capability recreations. He made his worldwide presentation against Chile on 7 October, going ahead as a substitute. On 7 November, he influenced his introduction in the beginning line-to up of the national group against Bolivia. His worldwide profession kept on prospering in mid 2002: he scored twice against Bolivia and once against Iceland. In 2002, he was an unexpected incorporation in the Brazil squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan. He was required to have a little influence in the competition. In any case, guarded midfielder and Brazilian group chief Emerson was harmed in preparing just before the principal World Cup amusement. In light of the misfortune, mentor Scolari called upon Gilberto to fill the hole which Emerson left. Gilberto wound up playing in each moment of each match of the competition, which Brazil proceeded to win. In the expressions of Veja magazine, Gilberto "conveyed the piano for Ronaldo and Rivaldo to play their tunes on". He was not without assaulting use either, setting up Ronaldo's semi-last objective to put Brazil through to the last. It was Gilberto's execution in this competition which prompted him being classed as one of the top cautious midfielders on the planet. 

On 22 June 2005, Gilberto played in Brazil's 1â 1 draw against Japan, in his solitary round of the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup. His nonappearance as a first group ordinary could be clarified by his absence of amusements, and therefore coordinate wellness, for Arsenal amid the season paving the way to the competition. Gilberto's appearance in the competition picked up him a victors decoration, as Brazil proceeded to win the challenge. On the back of his great Champions League structure, Gilberto was chosen for the Brazil national football crew for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Gilberto was substituted on in two recreations, and began twice because of another damage to Emerson. Brazil were beaten 1â 0 by France in the quarter last. Following Brazil's World Cup disillusionment, midfielder Juninho required the more seasoned individuals from the Brazil squad (counting Gilberto) to resign from global football. On the back of Gilberto's youth icon Dunga being named Brazil mentor, Gilberto did not accept Juninho's recommendation, and in this way proceeded with his universal vocation. 

On 1 June 2007, Gilberto captained Brazil against England at the primary senior universal match at the new Wembley Stadium. Having had an apparently decent headed objective denied following 20 minutes, he set up Brazil's solitary objective as the amusement finished 1â 1. Amid the mid year of 2007 Gilberto played in the Copa AmÃ©rica competition, in which he was picked to chief Brazil without LÃºcio. They proceeded to beat Argentina 3â 0 in the last, however he missed the last amusement through suspension. Following the finish of the 2007â 08 Premier League season, Gilberto was called up to the Brazil national group for 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers amid the mid year just as a voyage through the United States. 

Gilberto is regularly called "the imperceptible divider" in Brazil. His play regularly goes unnoticed as he positions himself between the two focus backs and the remainder of midfield, separating resistance assaults before they assemble energy. In this job, he is a piece of the guarded unit for both club and nation. When playing, he is more latent than most players in safeguard. As opposed to handle an adversary, he is bound to shadow him, consequently driving him back. Accordingly, he has a surprisingly spotless record for a protective midfielder: he has twice gone 45 amusements or more without getting a solitary booking amid his Arsenal profession. 

Gilberto is great at guarding against rivals who play a long ball game since he frequently man denotes the resistance's assaulting target-man. This slices off the resistance's supply to the strikers, and along these lines powers the long-ball crew to play through the midfield, something to which long-ball groups are not especially fit. 

Regardless of Gilberto's high pass fulfillment rate, his passing has been portrayed as unpredictable previously. 

As per ProZone (an information investigation framework utilized by football administrators) figures refered to by "The Sunday Times" in January 2007, Gilberto was, as one with Paul Scholes of Manchester United and Frank Lampard of Chelsea, one of only a handful couple of midfielders in England to accomplish "the tip top Champions League level" of execution.

In May 2016, Gilberto joined Panathinaikos as specialized executive. He left in December, following seven months in the job.
