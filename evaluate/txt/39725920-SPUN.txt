The Chase (U.S. diversion appear) 

The Chase is an American TV test show dependent on the British program of a similar name. The show debuted on August 6, 2013, on Game Show Network (GSN). It is facilitated by Brooke Burns, and highlights Mark Labbett (nicknamed "The Beast") as the "chaser". 

The American rendition of the show pursues a similar general configuration as the first UK adaptation, yet with groups of three contenders rather than four. The diversion is a test rivalry in which competitors endeavor to win cash by testing a test show virtuoso known as the chaser. Every candidate takes an interest in an individual "pursue" called the Cash Builder, in which they endeavor to respond to however many inquiries as could be expected under the circumstances in 60 seconds to win however much cash as could reasonably be expected to add to a prize store for the group. The hopeful must answer enough inquiries to remain in front of the chaser on the gameboard; else, they lose their rewards for that round. The challengers who effectively total their individual pursues without being gotten advance to the Final Chase, in which they answer inquiries as a group playing for an equivalent offer of the prize reserve gathered all through the scene. 

"The Chase" got positive basic gathering; Burns and Labbett earned positive surveys for their jobs, and one commentator adulated the arrangement for keeping away from a moderate pace in ongoing interaction. Both the arrangement and Burns got Daytime Emmy Award assignments; the arrangement was designated in 2014 for Outstanding Game Show, and Burns two years after the fact for Outstanding Game Show Host. Each lost to "Risk!" and Craig Ferguson (host of "Superstar Name Game") separately. 

Three new competitors contend on every scene as a group. In the first round, every challenger thusly wins cash for their group by addressing whatever number inquiries effectively as could be expected under the circumstances amid a one-minute fast flame round, entitled the "Money Builder". Each right answer in this round adds $5,000 to the bank; amid superstar scenes, contenders begin with $5,000 as of now in the bank. Toward the finish of the Cash Builder, the candidate takes an interest in a key component of the show called a "pursuit". In the pursuit, the chaser and the challenger each answer questions; the competitor begins with favorable position, and the chaser endeavors to get up to speed. The's challenger will likely answer enough inquiries accurately to move the earned rewards along the gameboard into the group bank without being gotten by the chaser, whose activity is to get them by exploiting their errors. 

The chaser begins eight spaces from the bank. The candidate has the alternative of beginning five stages from the bank, implying that they should respond to five inquiries accurately without being gotten to bank the cash and proceed to the following round. Before the pursuit begins, the chaser will make two ideas to the contender: one offer will be to play for a lower sum, yet begin one bit nearer to the bank, implying that they should respond to one less question effectively; the other offer will be to play for a higher sum, yet begin above and beyond far from the bank. On uncommon events, if the contender picks the higher offer, the chaser may heighten the stakes by offering an "overly offer" for a much higher sum. For this situation, the contender must answer seven inquiries accurately without being gotten and along these lines begin directly before the chaser, implying that the hopeful needs to respond to each question in that round effectively (accepting the chaser does as such also). 

After the challenger chooses for which add up to play, the prize cash is shown on the gameboard. The contender and chaser are given the equivalent numerous decision question, and every lock in their answer, which can't then be changed; different has five seconds to reply after them; else, they are bolted out and don't progress on the gameboard. For each inquiry the hopeful answers effectively, the prize cash appeared on the gameboard draws one stage nearer to the group bank. Likewise, the chaser draws one stage nearer to the hopeful's prize cash with each right answer. Further inquiries are asked until the competitor achieves the finish of the board (along these lines banking the prize cash), or the chaser gets the contender, dispensing with them from the diversion. No development is made by the candidate or the chaser if an off base answer is given or in the event that they are bolted out when limit. 

After every one of the three challengers have played a Cash Builder round pursued by a pursuit, the hopefuls who were not gotten by the chaser advance to the Final Chase, with the group bank set to the all out that they won in their Cash Builder rounds. On the off chance that each of the three hopefuls neglect to win their individual pursues, the group chooses one competitor to play the Final Chase alone for a sum of $15,000 ($5,000 per candidate). Amid VIP scenes, competitors who are gotten leave with $5,000 for their individual philanthropies. 

The Final Chase is played on a gameboard. The group gets a head beginning of one space for every part who best in class to this round. Amid the business break, the group picks between two arrangements of inquiries, named "An" and "B". The chaser plays the other set. The challengers have two minutes to respond to however many inquiries as could be expected under the circumstances. After an inquiry is asked, answers must be prompt, and challengers are just allowed to react or pass an inquiry after first ringing in. On the off chance that a candidate rings in yet another hopeful answers, the appropriate response is treated as wrong regardless of whether it was right. On the off chance that there is just a single challenger in the Final Chase, at that point the individual in question does not have to ring in. Each inquiry addressed accurately inside as far as possible moves the group one space ahead on the board. 

After time terminates, the chaser is given two minutes to get the group by accurately noting another arrangement of inquiries, with each right answer moving him one space along the load up. On the off chance that the chaser answers erroneously or passes, the clock is halted quickly and the group is allowed to address the inquiry, which they may affirm among themselves before replying. A right answer pushes the chaser back one space, or advances the group by one on the off chance that he has not proceeded onward to the gameboard. An erroneous answer gives no development to the chaser by any stretch of the imagination. Despite the result, the clock starts running again and the chaser keeps on responding to questions. In the event that the chaser comes up short on time before getting the group, the group parts the banked cash similarly, yet on the off chance that he gets them before time lapses, the group leaves with no cash. Amid big name scenes, if the chaser gets the group before time runs out, the group leaves with $15,000 partitioned similarly.
