It was the sixteenth race of the 2008 Formula One season. The 67-lap race was won by Fernando Alonso for the Renault group from fourth position on the beginning network. Robert Kubica completed second for BMW Sauber, and Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen third for Ferrari. 

Lewis Hamilton, the possible Drivers' Champion, drove the Championship going into the race, and began from shaft position nearby RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen. Hamilton's McLaren partner Heikki Kovalainen started from third, by Alonso. At the principal corner Hamilton braked late, compelling RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen wide. Hamilton was later given a punishment, and was censured by the British hustling press for overaggressive driving. Ferrari driver Felipe Massa, Hamilton's important Championship rival, was punished after an occurrence on lap two in which he contacted Hamilton's vehicle, making it turn. The episode dropped Hamilton to the back of the field, from where he was unfit to recover a scoring position. Massa later slammed into SÃ©bastien Bourdais of Toro Rosso. Bourdais was punished after the race, and downgraded from 6th to tenth position. The punishment provoked boundless analysis from the hustling media and ex-drivers. 

The triumph was Alonso's second back to back win; he began from fifteenth on the lattice to win the Singapore Grand Prix two weeks earlier. Kubica held off a decided assault from RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen in the end laps to come in just short of the win. Massa's seventh spot limited his hole to Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship to five. Ferrari built up a noteworthy lead over the McLaren group in the Constructors' Championship, with two races of the period remaining. 

The Grand Prix was challenged by 20Â drivers, in ten groups of two. The groups, otherwise called "constructors", were Ferrari, McLaren-Mercedes, Renault, Honda, Force India, BMW Sauber, Toyota, Red Bull Racing, Williams and Toro Rosso.

Hamilton underscored the esteem that a moderate hustling system could hold for his title possibilities: 

Fernando Alonso's triumph at the Singapore Grand Prix was his first Formula One win since rejoining the Renault group, in the wake of driving for McLaren in 2007. In the wake of qualifying in fifteenth and making an early pit stop, Alonso had figured out how to bounce to the front of the race when his partner Nelson Piquet Jr. slammed. Left with no chance to pit, the leaders needed to postpone their stops until the harm was cleared, permitting the intensely fuelled Alonso to move to the front once they did as such. In spite of the fact that Alonso addressed whether his Renault group could coordinate the pace of Ferrari and McLaren at Fuji, he said "We should stay focussed and attempt to rehash our dimension of execution from Singapore to battle at the front." Renault's specialized chief Bob Bell said that the group's improvement from the beginning of the period was empowering, yet "we perceive that we're not going to update McLaren and Ferrari this season".

As is typical for a Formula One race, Bridgestone conveyed two distinctive tire mixes to the race; the milder of the two set apart by a solitary white stripe down one of the sections.

This was then trailed by contact with Kovalainen, which at long last constrained RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen off the track. Each of the three drivers dropped down the field because of the episode. Kubica led the pack in front of Alonso and Kovalainen after the corner, maintaining a strategic distance from impacts as different vehicles bolted their tires on the virus track. Fisichella crashed into the back of Barrichello, dissipating carbon fiber over the track. Coulthard slammed into Bourdais and afterward Piquet, supporting suspension harm and sliding into the obstructions after turn two.

Nakajima completed last, in fifteenth, unfit to recoup after his constrained pit-stop from the get-go in the race. 

The main three finishers showed up in the consequent question and answer session where Alonso said that the choice to run a shorter second stretch than Kubica (between the first and second pit stops) was his choice: "At times you can do it, once in a while you can't however today the vehicle was impeccable and I had the capacity to do it." Alonso included that he believed in the vehicle to perform at the rest of the Grands Prix: "The inclination I have now is that we can do anything". Kubica said that his second-set completion was superior to his success at the Canadian Grand Prix prior in the season. He included that to complete the platform after BMW Sauber's inability to improve the vehicle from the earliest starting point of the period was an "extraordinary outcome for the group in, I think, a troublesome minute".

Imprint Blundell, who drove in Formula One for a long time, called for previous drivers to be a piece of the stewards gatherings which grant punishments: "You can analyze bits of paper, charts, telemetry, yet you don't have the foggiest idea about what's happening in a driver's mind until you've encountered it." Blundell's proposal in the long run moved toward becoming certainty - the 2010 season presented a framework whereby a previous F1 driver went about as a steward amid every Grand Prix.

In Italy, "La Gazzetta dello Sport" said that Hamilton's begin experienced "his standard over the top animosity". Hamilton said "I committed an error and I paid for it." 

Massa's touch on Hamilton's vehicle on lap two was named by the McLaren driver "as purposeful as it could be". Massa rejected the claim, saying "I had two wheels on the rock. I couldn't stop the vehicle and I was on the rock since he pushed me into the rock." Media inclusion of the occurrence proposed that however the contact was Massa's blame, it was unexpected. Simon Arron, composing for "The Daily Telegraph", said Hamilton's allegation of intentional contact was "contemptible and hasty", including that the contact was essentially a dashing occurrence. The hole between the drivers in the Drivers' Championship after the race remained at five, to support Hamilton, with two races remaining. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's inability to score focuses, joined with Ferrari's third and seventh, moved Ferrari to a noteworthy lead.
