Washington State Route 522 

State RouteÂ 522 (SRÂ 522) is a state thruway in the U.S. province of Washington that serves the Seattle metropolitan zone. Around long, it associates the city of Seattle toward the northeastern rural areas of Kenmore, Bothell, Woodinville, and Monroe. Its western half is essentially a blood vessel road, named Lake City Way and Bothell Way, that pursues the northern shore of Lake Washington; the eastern half is a level isolated interstate that keeps running among Woodinville and Monroe. SRÂ 522 associates a few of the metropolitan region's major expressways, including Interstate 5 (I-5), I-405, SRÂ 9, and U.S. Highway 2 (USÂ 2). 

The present-day course of SRÂ 522 was worked in stages somewhere in the range of 1907 and 1965, start with the Red Brick Road from Seattle to Bothell, at that point some portion of the Pacific Highway and later USÂ 99. The street later turned into a part of Primary State Highway 2 (PSHÂ 2) in 1937, and was stretched out east to Redmond and North Bend. A part of the Stevens Pass Highway was worked to associate PSHÂ 2 in Bothell and Monroe in 1965, and was joined into SRÂ 202 after it was assigned in 1964. The Bothellâ Monroe roadway was re-assigned as a major aspect of SRÂ 522 in 1970, leaving SRÂ 202 on the Bothellâ North Bend interstate. 

Since the late 1990s, the SRÂ 522 passageway among Woodinville and Monroe has been incompletely changed over to an expressway to address security concerns and a developing populace. Parts of the parkway close Woodinville and Monroe were augmented somewhere in the range of 2001 and 2014, while different segments close Maltby stay two paths wide and unified, with progress extends left unfunded. 

SRÂ 522, named Lake City Way inside Seattle city limits, starts at an exchange with I-5 in the Roosevelt neighborhood of northern Seattle, east of Green Lake. The exchange just permits developments south towards Downtown Seattle on I-5, and incorporates an association with the turnpike's reversible express path framework. The parkway voyages upper east from the exchange, burrowing under the convergence of Roosevelt Way NE and NE 75th Street; the crossing point itself is associated with SRÂ 522 by a progression of slopes to authority lanes. Lake City Way proceeds with upper east through Maple Leaf as a four-path blood vessel road before turning north on its way to deal with Thornton Creek. Subsequent to intersection the spring, the expressway enters the Lake City neighborhood, passing a few vehicle vendors. Lake City itself is an assigned urban town, with blended use improvement and loft structures that are revolved around the crossing point of Lake City Way between NE 125th Street and NE 145th Street. At NE 145th Street, SRÂ 522 meets SRÂ 523 and crosses into Lake Forest Park. 

Past Seattle, the parkway is named Bothell Way and pursues the northern shore of Lake Washington. SRÂ 522 converges Ballinger Way (SRÂ 104) at the focal strip mall in Lake Forest Park, and is joined by the Burke-Gilman Trail, a multi-use trail running along the lakefront on a previous railroad level. Bothell Way proceeds with east along the northern shore of Lake Washington through the city of Kenmore, situated on the mouth of the Sammamish River and home to the Kenmore Air Harbor seaplane base. SRÂ 522 ventures upriver through a limited valley that makes a sharp turn north towards Bothell. The interstate turns east and proceeds with downhill of the city's downtown business locale, remaining close to the Sammamish River (and the Sammamish River Trail) and meeting Bothell Way (previously SRÂ 527). Leaving Bothell, SRÂ 522 then goes around the southern edge of University of Washington Bothell grounds and crosses I-405, turning into a level isolated road. 

East of I-405, SRÂ 522 enters Woodinville and pursues Little Bear Creek as it dismisses north from the city's downtown, crossing SRÂ 202. The road enters Snohomish County and converges SRÂ 9 south of the Brightwater sewage treatment plant. It proceeds through a few sharp turns that pursue the Eastside Rail Corridor, a previous railroad level that runs northeasterly through the overwhelmingly rustic region close Grace. In Maltby, the interstate reaches an at-level convergence with Paradise Lake Road (SRÂ 524) and turns into a two-path unified parkway. SRÂ 522 ventures upper east from Maltby, meeting Echo Lake Road in a solitary point urban exchange, and crosses the Snohomish River into Monroe. Inside Monroe, the expressway enlarges to a four-path turnpike with middle partition and converges Main Street in a dogbone exchange close to the Monroe Correctional Complex. SRÂ 522 cuts crosswise over rural lodging territories in Monroe, and traverses USÂ 2 and the BNSF Railway close to the Evergreen State Fairgrounds. The expressway makes a 180-degree swing south to cross with USÂ 2, where it ends; the convergence additionally has a direct offramp for eastward traffic from SRÂ 522 to eastward USÂ 2. 

The whole course of SRÂ 522 is assigned as a major aspect of the National Highway System, ordering it as critical to the national economy, resistance, and versatility. The State of Washington likewise assigns the SRÂ 522 hallway as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which incorporates roadways that associate real networks all through the state. The roadway is the essential course for Seattle-territory inhabitants to get to Stevens Pass and different pieces of the Cascade Mountains. SRÂ 522 is kept up by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which leads a yearly overview on the state's parkways to gauge traffic volume as far as normal yearly day by day traffic. In 2016, WSDOT determined that 96,000 vehicles utilized SRÂ 522 at its trade with I-405 and 12,000 vehicles utilized it at its eastern end in Monroe, the most elevated and least checks along the parkway, separately. 

Logging settlements were set up on the northern shore of Lake Washington during the 1870s, depending basically on the water for intercity transportation. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was worked along the lakefront in 1888, associating Seattle to the new towns of Bothell and Kenmore. By the 1890s, unpaved logging trails had been finished along Lake Washington and the railroad, coming to as far upper east as Maltby. 

Bothell businessperson and great streets advocate Gerhard Ericksen effectively campaigned the Washington State Legislature to finance the development of a street from Seattle to Bothell as a State Aid Road and Permanent Highway in 1903. The principal area of the roadway, going from Ravenna Park in Seattle to Lake Forest Park, was finished in 1907 and was articulated by "The Seattle Times" as one of the "best bits of street to be found anyplace in the United States". From 1911 to 1913, the state and district government cleared of the expressway between Lake Forest Park and Bothell with blocks. The roadway, named the Ericksen Road after its advertiser and Bothell Road after the city of Bothell, was opened on January 10, 1914, in an occasion named the "Street Blowout" that included 50 autos crossing the whole course among Seattle and Bothell. A large portion of the block street was supplanted in 1934, yet an area south of downtown Bothell was protected and stays known as Red Brick Road Park. 

The Bothell Road turned out to be a piece of the Pacific Highway in 1915, shaping piece of the parkway that would proceed with north from Bothell towards Everett. In 1922, the first street arrangement through cutting edge Lake City was skirted by the new, concrete-cleared Victory Way, committed in the memory of World War I veterans. The Pacific Highway was joined into another national parkway framework that was endorsed by the American Association of State Highway Officials on November 11, 1926, and numbered as USÂ 99. On October 15, 1927, the North Trunk Highway was opened among Seattle and Everett, giving a shorter and more straightforward course that would later be assigned as USÂ 99 and the Pacific Highway. The Bothell Highway was redesigned from Seattle to Lake Forest Park in 1939, including an enlarging to four paths and fixing of certain portions. Some portion of the interstate in Seattle city limits was renamed to Lake City Way in 1967, in the wake of campaigning from Lake City agents. 

An unpaved expansion of the Bothell Road, going along the Sammamish River to Woodinville, Redmond, and Fall City, was assigned as a part of the Sunset Highway (State Road 2) in 1925. The roadway was later cleared and joined into a more drawn out part of the Sunset Highway (re-assigned as Primary State Highway 2) in 1937, running from Downtown Seattle to Fall City. The branch parkway was stretched out to North Bend after the opening of a Sunset Highway sidestep in 1941, utilizing the previous mainline street. 

Another part of the Bothell Road, from Bothell to the Stevens Pass Highway (Primary State Highway 15) in Monroe, was proposed by the state great streets relationship in the late 1930s. In 1941, subsidizing for this portion was dismissed by the state senate, for finishing the roadway among Everett and Monroe first. The Bothellâ Monroe Cutoff was assigned as a part of Primary State Highway 15 of every 1943, with an arrangement that the roadway would be developed after the culmination of the Everettâ Monroe course. Development of the interstate was pushed back to 1961, and it was additionally deferred by stormy climate. The Bothellâ Monroe Cutoff opened on February 10, 1965, costing $5.3Â million (proportional to $Â million in dollars) and cutting 20 minutes in movement time among Seattle and the Stevens Pass ski zone. 

In 1963, the Washington State Legislature dispatched another state thruway numbering framework to ease disarray over comparably numbered courses. The new framework appeared in 1964, at first with State RouteÂ 522 (SRÂ 522) doled out to the part of Primary State Highway 2 from Seattle to North Bend, and State RouteÂ 202 (SRÂ 202) doled out to the part of Primary State Highway 15 from Woodinville to Monroe. By 1970, SRÂ 522 had been moved to the Bothellâ Monroe Cutoff, while SRÂ 202 was moved to the Woodinvilleâ North Bend parkway. 

The North Seattle area of the Everettâ Seattle Freeway (presently I-5) opened on August 28, 1963, including access to Bothell Way in the Roosevelt neighborhood. SRÂ 522 was truncated to I-5, evacuating Roosevelt Way and Eastlake Avenue from the state parkway framework. A four-level road trade with I-405 east of Bothell was finished in 1969, making an association somewhere in the range of SRÂ 522 and SRÂ 202. 

In 1968, the state expressway division proposed the change of SRÂ 522 into a road bypassing Lake City Way and Bothell Way. The arrangement drew overwhelming restriction from nearby occupants, who dreaded bottlenecks and a decrease in personal satisfaction, and was expelled from territorial road designs in 1973. Expressway designs in Monroe pushed ahead rather, with the culmination of a detour toward the west of downtown in 1972. SRÂ 522 was moved from its steering on Main Street to the new interstate, which ended at USÂ 2 and expelled a railroad level intersection from the course. 

Since the 1980s, populace development in Monroe and around the SRÂ 522 has brought about expanded traffic clog and security issues, incorporating an ascent in mishaps and accidents. The expressway was initially intended for possible transformation into a four-path interstate, with extra option to proceed and connect approaches worked in 1965. Somewhere in the range of 1980 and 1995, the stretch of SRÂ 522 among Woodinville and Monroe was the site of more than 1,100 mishaps and 40 passings. SRÂ 522 has been named as a standout amongst the most hazardous thruways in the United States by "Peruser's Digest" in 1995 and "Forbes" in 2007, among different records. The musical crew "State Route 522" shaped in 1995 by neighborhood non mainstream shake performer Jake Snider was named for the thruway. 

Because of the accidents on SRÂ 522, neighborhood inhabitants sorted out a grassroots battle ("Citizens Rallying for a Safer Highway") to appeal to the state for wellbeing upgrades and an interstate enlarging. In 1993, the state lawmaking body designated $180Â million (proportionate to $Â million in dollars) in financing towards a five-organize enlarging venture, yet the assets were exchanged to the general reserve at the command of Governor Mike Lowry. The 1994 supplemental transportation spending plan included $2Â million for building thinks about on SRÂ 522, with development of a four-path interstate financed through different methods. State legislators prescribed tolling SRÂ 522 to satisfy development bonds, however the arrangement was pulled back after restriction from nearby occupants. 

Existing state reserves were utilized for the principal phases of the SRÂ 522 passageway venture, including the expansion of middle thunder strips and improved asphalt markers in 1995, which diminished head-on crashes. The city of Monroe supplanted the eastern portion of SRÂ 522 trade with Main Street (164th Street Southeast) with an indirect, the first to be worked in Snohomish County, in 2001. The main phase of the hallway venture was finished in 2001 and extended an area among SRÂ 9 and Paradise Lake Road (SRÂ 524) in Maltby, at an expense of $22Â million. The second stage, another single-point urban exchange at Echo Lake Road southwest of Monroe, was finished in 2006 at an expense of $37Â million. The third phase of the SRÂ 522 hall venture was finished in 2014, enlarging the parkway to four paths over the Snohomish River and through Monroe to USÂ 2, where another eastward offramp was likewise developed independently in 2012. Another circuitous at the 164th Street Southeast trade was additionally opened as a feature of the task, finishing the dogbone exchange. 

The rest of the phases of the SRÂ 522 passage venture among Maltby and the Snohomish River were wanted to be financed by the Roads and Transit ticket measure in 2007, preceding it was dismissed by nearby voters. The 2015 state transportation bundle included $10Â million in configuration subsidizing for an exchange at Paradise Lake Road in Maltby, to be made accessible in 2025, yet development of the trade and enlarging of the rest of the portion stays unfunded. The primer plan choices for the future precious stone exchange would put the principle slopes at either SRÂ 524 or Paradise Lake Road. An alliance of lawmaker and business pioneers named "Finish522" was framed in 2018 to campaign the state government for hindrances and complete evaluation partition in the wake of a few deadly crashes in the mid-2010s. Long haul plans from WSDOT to address expanding traffic blockage in downtown Monroe incorporate the development of a parkway sidestep for USÂ 2 toward the north of the city. The undertaking would incorporate a northern augmentation of SRÂ 522 to converge the realigned USÂ 2 close Kelsey Street and Chain Lake Road. 

The western bit of SRÂ 522, including Lake City Way and Bothell Way, is a noteworthy open travel passageway for the locale and is served by Sound Transit Express and King County Metro transport courses. Transport paths were added to areas of SRÂ 522 in Seattle, Lake Forest Park, and Kenmore during the 1990s, and were extended during the 2000s. In 2002, Sound Transit propelled express RouteÂ 522, going between Downtown Seattle and Woodinville. 

Sound Transit intends to run a Stride transport quick travel line on SRÂ 522 from NE 145th Street to the University of Washington Bothell grounds as a feature of its Sound Transit 3 program, endorsed in 2016. The line is planned to start administration in 2024 and will end at the NE 145th Street light rail station in Shoreline. The hall has additionally been proposed for types of rail travel since the mid-twentieth century, including the flopped Forward Thrust vote proportions of 1968 and 1970, the Seattle Monorail Project, and light rail in the Sound Transit long-go plan.
