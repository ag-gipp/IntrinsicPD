The 1896 Cedar Keys sea tempest was a ground-breaking and ruinous tropical violent wind that crushed a significant part of the East Coast of the United States, beginning with Florida's Cedar Keys, close to the finish of September 1896. The tempest's quick development enabled it to keep up quite a bit of its power after landfall and cause noteworthy harm over a wide region; accordingly, it wound up one of the costliest United States storms at the time. The fourth tropical violent wind of the 1896 Atlantic typhoon season, it shaped by September 22, likely from a tropical wave, before intersection the Caribbean Sea only south of the Greater Antilles. It entered the Gulf of Mexico as what might be compared to a noteworthy storm on the Saffirâ Simpson scale, and struck the Cedar Keysâa seaward island chain that incorporates the island and city of Cedar Keyâfrom the get-go the morning of September 29 with breezes of 125Â mph (205Â km/h). The territory was immersed by a staggering tempest flood that undermined structures, washed out the associating railroad to the terrain, and submerged the littler, peripheral islands, where 31 individuals were murdered. Solid breezes additionally obliterated a large number of the red cedar trees that assumed a vital job in the economy of the locale. 

The violent wind proceeded with inland over the Suwannee River valley, causing far reaching decimation in many networks crosswise over inside northern Florida; in the hardest-hit settlements, extreme breezes left couple of trees or structures standing.

Solid breezes and high tides battered southeastern South Carolina, demolishing rice yields and stripping off rooftops. The tempest at that point followed through for the most part provincial areas of North Carolina and did noteworthy breeze harm in the Raleighâ Durham region. 

In spite of the fact that the sea tempest was debilitating and progressing into an extratropical typhoon late on September 29, its fast forward development added to high twist speeds crosswise over pieces of the Mid-Atlantic states, with blasts drawing nearer . Furthermore, heavy rains fell west of the tempest's track. In Virginia, urban areas and farming locale alike endured broad harm. Streak flooding in the Shenandoah Valley finished in the disappointment of an earthen dam upstream from Staunton, releasing a downpour of water that cleared homes from their establishments and desolated the town's trade locale.

Albeit little is thought about the framework preceding its section through the Leeward Islands as a typhoon on September 22, it likely began from a tropical wave that left the western shore of Africa. Its track has been re-broke down numerous occasions since the mid twentieth century. For a few days, the tempest moved westbound through the northern Caribbean Sea, passing only south of Jamaica as a low-end typhoon on September 25.

As the tempest entered the Gulf of Mexico, it started to quicken and bend toward the north-upper east. 

In the early morning on September 29, the focal point of the sea tempest made landfall on Cedar Key, Florida, with a base focal weight of , and moved inland crosswise over Levy County. The violent wind had a surprisingly tight center, with a range of most extreme breeze, and was going at a quick pace of about . Thus, its evaluated greatest breezes of 125Â mph (205Â km/h) were higher than weight alone would recommend. The little however extraordinary sea tempest proceeded with northeastward through northern Florida and southeastern Georgia, and its center contracted further; outside of a tight passageway along the tempest's track, winds were similarly light. At Savannah, Georgia, pneumatic stress fell 15Â hPa (0.45Â inHg) in 45 minutes as the tempest focus passed just toward the west around noontime on September 29. The framework debilitated as it sped northward through the Carolinas, however when it achieved the Mid-Atlantic states on the night of September 29, its inexorably quick forward development added to recharged wind viciousness.

As the tempest came aground, the Cedar Keys were struck by a tempest flood that exploited people regularly wrongly called a "tsunami." Yankeetown got a considerably higher tempest flood of . The fundamental road through the focal point of Cedar Keyâthe most crowded island in the Cedar Keys island chainâwas seriously overwhelmed by of water, which attacked each structure and left vast sinkholes when it retreated. Walkways along the road were washed out. The flood of water undermined the establishments of stone structures, debilitating a large number of them to the point of breakdown, while clearing ceaselessly more fragile structures.

Absolute property harm in New York was evaluated at $50,000 (identical to $Â million in ). 

Substantial precipitation drenched pieces of Ohio for four days starting on September 27. Coming about floods harmed yields and property, and the nasty climate disturbed William McKinley's presidential crusade exercises at his home in Canton. 

On September 30, storms from the previous tropical storm cleared over the Great Lakes. Many onlookers lined the shores of Lake Michigan at Chicago, Illinois, to watch the huge waves. A yacht was torn from its moorings at Chicago, and collided with almost twelve littler vessels while being blown about. The boat "Beauty" from Racine, Wisconsin, disappeared in the midst of the tempest, while the flatboat "Sumatra" separated and inverted close Milwaukee, ending the lives of four team individuals; the commander, first mate, and cook were securely protected. The tempest harmed around $75,000 worth of property on the Great Lakes (identical to $Â million in ).
