"Mother and Me and Mom" (2013) is the seventh of Maya Angelou's arrangement of collections of memoirs. It was finished 11 years after the distribution of her past life account, "A Song Flung Up to Heaven" (2002), and more than thirty years after she kept in touch with her first personal history, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" (1969).

Amid this period, she was granted the Lincoln Medal in 2008 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011. 

Angelou had turned out to be perceived and profoundly regarded as a representative for Blacks and ladies and was, as researcher Joanne Braxton has expressed, "without a doubt,Â ... America's most unmistakable dark lady autobiographer". She had additionally turned into "a noteworthy personal voice of the time". Angelou was one of the primary African-American female journalists to openly talk about her own life, and one of the first to utilize herself as a focal character in her books. Essayist Julian Mayfield, who called her first collection of memoirs "a masterpiece that escapes depiction", expressed that Angelou's arrangement set a point of reference for other Black ladies authors, yet for the class of personal history all in all. Researcher Hilton Als called Angelou one of the "pioneers of self-presentation", willing to concentrate sincerely on the more antagonistic parts of her identity and decisions. For instance, while Angelou was making her second life account, "Assemble in My Name", she was worried about how her perusers would respond to her revelation that she had been a whore. Her better half Paul Du Feu convinced her to distribute the book by urging her to "come clean as an author" and to "speak the truth about it". 

Out of the blue, Angelou centers around her association with her mom in this book, and fills in what analyst Fiona Sturges calls "conceivably the last spaces in Angelou's astounding life". As indicated by Candace Smith, who looked into the sound form of the book for "Booklist", Angelou and Baxter's relationship was "contacted upon however never completely depicted" in "Confined Bird", yet "Mother and Me and Mom" clarifies Baxter's activities, particularly the reasons she sent Angelou and her more established sibling Bailey to live with their grandma in Stamps, Arkansas. The book likewise annals Angelou's underlying awkward gathering and possible compromise with Baxter. Pictures of Baxter, Angelou, and their family and dear companions show up all through the book and upgrade the content. A sound adaptation of the book, perused by Angelou, was discharged in CD structure and as a computerized download. 

Angelou clarifies in the book's preface why she composed the book, which was to clarify how she progressed toward becoming, in spite of being brought into the world poor, Black, and female, a famous writer and artist. The book is partitioned into two areas: the initial 13 parts are gathered into the main segment, called "Mother and Me", and the rest of the parts make up the second segment, called "Me and Mom". Angelou expresses gratitude toward her mom, "who liberally shown me how to be a mother", which enabled her to devote the book to her child, Guy Bailey Johnson, whom she calls "a standout amongst the most fearless and liberal men I know". 

Angelou's mom, Vivian Baxter, was conceived in St. Louis, Missouri, at the turn of the twentieth century, the most seasoned of six offspring of her Trinidadian dad and her Irish mother. Baxter's family was brutal, yet religious and melodic. Baxter, "who was to remain an alarming delight", met Angelou's dad, Bailey Johnson, a dietitian and cook, in 1924, upon Johnson's arrival from serving in World War I. They wedded and moved to California, where Angelou and her more established sibling, Bailey, Jr., were conceived. When she was three and Bailey was five, their folks separated and sent their kids, via train with distinguishing proof labels and no grown-up supervision, to live with their fatherly grandma, Annie Henderson, in Stamps, Arkansas. 

Angelou and her sibling lived with their grandma and her child, Uncle Willie, until Angelou was thirteen. They quickly visited their mom in St. Louis, yet at eight years old Angelou was assaulted, and in striking back the attacker was slaughtered by individuals from her family. She felt so regretful for his demise that she quit conversing with everybody except Bailey for quite a while. They were sent back to Stamps, yet when Bailey turned 14, they came back to their mom's consideration in San Francisco for his insurance. At first, Angelou was safe and furious towards her mom for relinquishing her and Bailey, calling her "Woman", and it took her quite a long while to warm to her. 

One summer, Bailey and Angelou made separate outings to visit their dad in San Diego, in what "Kirkus Reviews" called "a truly revolting gathering". Angelou did not coexist with her stepmother. Amid her visit, her dad took Angelou to Mexico; he turned out to be so tanked, she needed to drive him back over the outskirt, despite the fact that she had never determined a vehicle. When they came back to San Diego, Angelou's stepmother cut Angelou with a couple of scissors amid a contention. Angelou lived in the city until her injury was mended. When she came back to San Francisco, she chose she needed a vocation as a streetcar conductor; at first, she was not employed in light of the fact that she was Black, yet upon her mom's support, she was diligent with the streetcar organization until she turned into the principal Black to chip away at the railroad. Baxter furnished security by following Angelou with a gun. 

At the point when Angelou was seventeen, she wound up pregnant after a one-time experience with a neighbor kid. She told Bailey, who prompted her to conceal it from their mom and stepfather until she moved on from secondary school. Three weeks before the introduction of her child, she let them know. Baxter's response was to run a shower; as Angelou stated, "In our family, for some obscure reason, we think of it as a respect to run a shower, to put in air pockets and great fragrances for someone else". Baxter helped Angelou through the birth; from that point on, Angelou started to call her "Mom", and later, "Mother". 

The remainder of the book comprises of a progression of accounts about the manners in which that Baxter upheld and acknowledged her little girl and kept on winning her adoration and regard, through unwed parenthood, a fizzled marriage, and profession high points and low points. Angelou relates a few accounts of Baxter, including her help of Angelou as a free single parent, her life-sparing mediation after a desirous ex beat Angelou, and her underlying opposition and afterward acknowledgment of Angelou's first marriage to Greek mariner Tosh Angelos. Angelou relates the start of her profession as an artist and performer in San Francisco; Baxter thought about her grandson as Angelou voyaged Europe as an individual from the Gershwin musical show "Porgy and Bess". Angelou felt so remorseful about abandoning her child that she returned and continued her association with her mom and child, in the long run moving to New York City and beginning another vocation as an author and artist. 

Angelou relates, proudly, her mom's social exercises, in the Order of the Eastern Star and dark ladies' altruistic associations in Stockton, California, just as her profession as one of the main dark female trader sailors. At a certain point, Baxter drops everything and goes to her little girl's guide while Angelou was taking a shot at a motion picture in Stockholm. Baxter underpins Angelou's choice to live in Africa for some time and afterward, after Angelou came back to the U.S., to turn into an instructor at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Angelou portrays Baxter's marriage, late in her life, to Angelou's fourth stepfather, whom Baxter called her most prominent love and who was Angelou's top choice. There is a troublesome scene among Angelou and her sibling, who in spite of his apparently simple reentry into their mom's life when they were adolescents (she calls them "the new darlings"), had plummeted into battles with medication misuse. 

Angelou closes "Mother and Me and Mom" with a portrayal of Vivian Baxter's demise in 1991, and of Angelou's last words to her on her deathbed. In 1995, the city of Stockton regarded Baxter for her numerous long stretches of administration by naming a recreation center after her. 

Beginning with "Confined Bird", Angelou made a purposeful endeavor while composing every one of her collections of memoirs, including "Mother and Me and Mom", to challenge the standard structure of the self-portrayal by evaluating, changing, and extending the class. Her utilization of fiction-composing procedures, for example, discourse, portrayal, and topical advancement has frequently driven analysts to sort her books as personal fiction. Valerie Sayers, in her survey of "Mother and Me and Mom" in "The Washington Post", calls Angelou's books journals on account of their restricted center, however adulates her for depicting what it resembled to grow up Black in "Jim Crow America". Sayers states: "She figures out how to completely uncover that national sore without picking at it, a slick trap that...requires impressive limitation and her very own steely altruism". Angelou expressed in a 1989 meeting that she was the main "genuine" essayist to pick the class to convey what needs be. As commentator Susan Gilbert expressed, Angelou was announcing not one individual's story, however the collective's. Researcher Selwyn R. Cudjoe concurred, and saw Angelou as illustrative of the tradition in African-American self-portrayal as an open signal that represented a whole gathering of individuals. Angelou's manager Robert Loomis had the capacity to persuade her to state "Confined Bird" by provoking her to compose a self-portrayal that could be considered "high craftsmanship", which she proceeded all through her arrangement. In spite of the fact that Angelou was effective, she was, as Sayers demanded, brilliant and sufficiently talented to compose for any gathering of people, however decided not to compose for "a highbrow abstract group of onlookers", yet for "perusers as open, energetic and clear as herself". 

Angelou's collections of memoirs fit in with the class' standard structure: they are composed by a solitary creator, they are ordered, and they contain components of character, procedure, and topic. In a 1983 meeting with African-American writing pundit Claudia Tate, Angelou called her books self-portrayals. When discussing her one of a kind utilization of the class, she recognized that she has pursued the slave story custom of "talking in the main individual solitary discussing the principal individual plural, continually saying I signifying 'we'". Angelou perceived that there were anecdotal viewpoints to every one of her books; she tended to "veer from the customary thought of life account as truth". Her methodology paralleled the traditions of numerous African-American personal histories composed amid the abolitionist time frame in the US, when truth was frequently controlled for reasons for self-security. Creator Lyman B. Hagen has set Angelou in the long custom of African-American collection of memoirs, however demanded that she has made a novel elucidation of the personal structure. 

In a 1998 meeting with writer George Plimpton, Angelou examined her composition procedure, and "the occasionally tricky idea of truth in verifiable" and journals. Whenever inquired as to whether she changed reality to improve her story, she expressed, "Once in a while I make a distance across from a composite of three or four individuals, on the grounds that the embodiment in just a single individual isn't adequately solid to be expounded on." Although Angelou has never confessed to changing the actualities in her accounts, she has utilized these certainties to have an effect with the peruser. As Hagen expressed, "One can accept that 'the pith of the information' is available in Angelou's work". Hagen likewise expressed that Angelou "fictionalizes, to improve intrigue". Angelou's long-lasting proofreader, Robert Loomis, states that she could modify any of her books by changing the request of her certainties to have an alternate effect on the peruser. Like "Confined Bird", the occasions in "Mother and Me and Mom" and the remainder of her personal histories are rambling and made as a progression of short stories, yet don't pursue a severe sequence, something that Angelou uses to propel her perusers forward. Sayers concurs, saying that Angelou gives little consideration to sequential request in the book. Sayers additionally states, "Time races through this account". Significant characters, similar to Angelou's stepfather Daddy Clidell, vanish after their underlying notice. Despite the fact that Angelou rehashes numerous tales found in her before life accounts, the concentration in "Mother and Me and Mom" is on her mom; as per commentator Stacy Russo, "that center makes this a particular expansion to Angelou's personal works". Analyst Pam Kingsbury, who profoundly suggested the book for all gatherings of people, expressed those acquainted with Angelou's past works "will be compensated with an increasingly total image of her life", while new perusers "will find a very much made and astute prologue to the writer". 

Commentators have judged "Mother and Me and Mom" and Angelou's different collections of memoirs "in light of the first", and "Confined Bird" for the most part gets the most astounding acclaim. Marjorie Kehe of "The Christian Science Monitor", thinks about the book" "a continuation of "Confined Bird."" "Huge numbers of the occasions portrayed in Angelou's past collections of memoirs are returned to in this one, some with more detail than others, for example, her time of vagrancy, which was depicted in "Confined Bird," and her genuine beating by her envious beau, which was first uncovered in "Letter to My Daughter" (2008), Angelou's third book of articles. As indicated by Fiona Sturges, who assessed "Mother and Me and Mom" in the British distribution "The Independent", "As in her past books, these stories are told with clear-sightedness and a nonappearance of self indulgence, and they are no less dreary for their nature. Angelou has never been one for flowery composition, and here she keeps up an exact and practical style which makes these dreary minutes progressively distinctive, similar to a film from which you can't turn away". Sayers expresses that major sensational occasions, for example, the occurrence when Angelou was beaten, "are conveyed absent much enhancement or further reference". 

Angelou portrays her composition procedure as controlled. Starting with "Confined Bird", she has utilized the equivalent "composing custom" for a long time. She gets up at five in the first part of the day and registers with a lodging, where the staff has been told to expel any photos from the dividers. She composes on lawful cushions while lying on the bed, with a jug of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, "Roget's Thesaurus", and the Bible, and leaves by the early evening. She midpoints 10â 12 pages of material daily, which she alters down to three or four pages at night. Angelou experiences this procedure to "charm" herself, and as she said in a 1989 meeting with the BBC, to "remember the distress, the anguish, the "Sturm und Drang"". She puts herself back in the time she is expounding on, amid horrendous encounters like her assault in "Confined Bird", to "tell the human truth" about her life. Angelou has expressed that she plays cards to achieve that spot of charm, to get to her recollections all the more viably. She has expressed, "It might take an hour to get into it, yet once I'm in itâha! It's so delectable!" She doesn't discover the procedure cathartic; rather, she has discovered alleviation in "coming clean". 

"Mother and Me and Mom" appeared at number 8 on "The New York Times" blockbuster list the seven day stretch of its discharge, 21 April 2013. The book, similar to Angelou's past collections of memoirs, got for the most part positive audits. Fiona Sturges, who surveys the book in the British production "The Independent", and analyst Stacy Russo of "Library Journal" both express that Angelou's perusers would perceive a significant number of the sections in "Mother and Me and Mom" from her prior collections of memoirs. Bernardine Evaristo of the British distribution "The Observer", in one of only a handful couple of negative surveys of "Mother and Me and Mom", calls the book "a slight, episodic and severely altered book that repeats stories from past journals". Evaristo questions the veracity of Angelou's accounts, and expresses that some of them negate prior variants. Evaristo additionally trusts that "Mother and Me and Mom" undermines "Confined Bird", which she calls "a pivotal triumph". 

As indicated by analyst Heid Erdrich, "Mother and Me and Mom" does not focus on Angelou's youth injury, as portrayed in "Confined Bird", yet "rather builds a picture of self by means of subtleties of her relationship to the mother who surrendered her and with whom she rejoined as a young person". Erdrich states that Angelou's composition is "all around basically composed", and calls her tone "generally light, even sweet, loaded up with warmth for her more youthful self". Erdrich states that despite the fact that it could have been composed for young ladies encountering similar challenges Angelou confronted, the book does not lecture, however "presents Angelou's life way dispersed with tremendous impediments persevered through and vanquished through learning of self and a particular brand of mother love". "Distributers Weekly" concurs, expressing, "The exercises and love introduced here will address those endeavoring to advance on the planet". Erdrich additionally expresses that Angelou's account of her "hard-won love for her phenomenal mother" is convincing, and that Angelou depicts Baxter "as exceptionally mindful, freed from what others may think, and autonomous past any women's activist of her time" and "the stuff of fiction however genuine and capable in surprising ways for the endowment of her gifted little girl". 

Most faultfinders feel that Baxter is exhibited well in "Mother and Me and Mom". Candace Smith, who audits the sound adaptation of the book, expresses that Angelou commends the unlimited acknowledgment and backing of her mom, who appears to be "a road savvy, mindful lady who molded the writer's life and inheritance by her words and model". Vanessa Bush of "Booklist" considers the book an "adoring memory of an entangled relationship" and a "wonderful and profoundly uncovering annal of adoration and recuperating". Russo states that the book is "a delightful tribute to Baxter's free, lively, and fearless soul". Evaristo deviates, and expresses that Baxter seems to be "less adjusted, less intriguing, progressively purified and less valid" than Angelou depicts her somewhere else. Sturges calls the book "a significantly moving story of detachment and gathering, and an at last hopeful picture of the maternal bond". The most intriguing piece of the book, as per Sturges, is "Angelou's easygoing upsetting of the possibility of the mother who deserts her kids as gigantic and coldhearted". Sturges additionally says that Baxter is displayed as proud, alluring, autonomous, and flexible, attributes that "have apparently been passed on to her little girl". Commentator Valerie Sayers demands that the scenes that delineate Angelou's "stopping ventures" towards her absolution and acknowledgment of her mom are among the best in the book. Sayers names "Mother and Me and Mom" "a record of absolution", and like Angelou and Baxter, "sufficiently uncovering, and quite overwhelming". Like her mom anticipated from her, Angelou anticipates that her perusers should move past their feelings of hatred and "whatever was horrendous". Sayers likewise calls both Baxter and Angelou "a Large Dramatic Presence", and says that Angelou matches her mom's soul. 

As indicated by Sayers, the book contains Angelou's "trademark geniality and furious positive thinking". "Kirkus Reviews" expresses that consistent with Angelou's style, her composition "gets straight to the point with pressure and straightforwardness", and that it contains a "calypso smoothness, whirlwinds and showers of musicality between the snapshots of underhandedness". Kirkus likewise considers the book a "firmly hung, finely tuned diary". As indicated by Candace Smith in her audit of the book's sound variant, Angelou performs it "in her trademark moderate and keen tones, and with watchful articulation". Albeit a portion of her tales are excruciating to hear, Angelou is "verifiably genuine". Smith additionally states, "Despite the fact that her voice doesn't indicate much outward feeling, her words are so amazing and the accounts so intriguing that we remain bolted". 

Most pundits concurred that the book would be famous with perusers acquainted with Angelou's works and to her new perusers. Marjorie Kehe of The Christian Science Monitor, who calls it "an account of recovery" and "a delicate read and an exquisite tribute", envisions that Angelou's perusers would take pleasure in it. Russo predicts that because of Angelou's notoriety and "receptive composition", the book would have wide intrigue for some perusers.
