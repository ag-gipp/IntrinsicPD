In 2011, it participated in aid ventures following the floods in Queensland, the Christchurch seismic tremor, and the TÅhoku quake and torrent in Japan. The Queensland floods required the clearing of two C-17s to Richmond, when Amberley was compromised by rising waters; of the other two Globemasters, one was in the Middle East and the other was experiencing support at Amberley and couldn't be flown however was moved onto high ground and got away harm. The arrangement to Japan included each of the three of the squadron's accessible C-17s, the fourth as yet being overhauled at Amberley. On 11Â May 2012, a C-17 flew an Australian Army M1 Abrams tank from RAAF Base Darwin to Shoalwater Bay for a preparation work out; it was the first run through a RAAF Globemaster had carried an Abrams, which at 61 tons was among the biggest single things the 70-ton-limit flying machine could convey. In November that year the squadron took conveyance of its 6th Globemaster. It was again granted the Gloucester Cup in March 2013, for its capability the earlier year.
