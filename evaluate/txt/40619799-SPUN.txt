"A Cure for Pokeritis" was one of many Vitagraph's one-reel or shorter comedies featuring Bunny and Finch in a local setting, referred to famously as "Bunnygraphs" or "Bunnyfinches". The quantity of these shorts that were initially created is obscure in light of the fact that Vitagraph's movies were commonly not filed. Assessments fluctuate impressively; aggregates more than 150, 200, or 260 have been proposed. The vast majority of the studio's movies are currently viewed as lost. 

The film was an early case of endeavors to move past venue blocking traditions. Amid the police attack, profundity was exhibited by having move make place in both the frontal area and the foundation, and by enabling performing artists to move between the spaces. This cinematography procedure loaned authenticity to the scene, and improved its pacing. 

In the quiet time, motion pictures were joined by an assortment of live and recorded music. Contingent upon the film and the scene, the music may have been the execution of a live piano player or ensemble, recorded music, or missing completely. A few pictures were appropriated with signal sheets demonstrating when music was to be played, or treasurys of explicit melodies to use as backup. Particularly somewhere in the range of 1910 and 1912, these determinations were regularly well known music, picked on the grounds that the melody's title or verses identified with the film somehow or another, as opposed to later endeavors to furnish music with fitting surface. Starting in 1910, Vitagraph gave arrangements of this nature to the majority of their movies. 

Vitagraph's suggested music for "A Cure for Pokeritis" started with "I'm Glad I'm Married" and "I've Got My Eyes on You". The studio recommended possibly "I Don't Believe You" or "I'm an Honorary Member of the Patsy Club" be played as George introduced his implied hotel enrollment. His rest talking was to be joined by "In the event that You Talk in Your Sleep, Don't Mention My Name", trailed by "Back to the Factory, Mary" as Freddie researches.

The Bunnygraphs, as a class, were illustrative of the film of the period, and were extremely effective, making Bunny the main American comic film star and Finch the primary female star comic. "A Cure for Pokeritis", discharged February 23, 1912, was exclusively generally welcomed, incorporating into showings outside the United States. The "Thames Star", a New Zealand paper, portrayed the film as "screamingly clever". After John Bunny's passing, enthusiasm for his movies drove Vitagraph in 1917 to declare the re-arrival of this film (retitled "A Sure Cure for Pokeritis"), alongside huge numbers of his different works, as "Most loved Film Features". In any case, the parody style of "A Cure for Pokeritis" has not matured well, particularly as opposed to Mack Sennett's droll movies and crafted by later entertainers, for example, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. As indicated by film researchers Donald McCaffrey and Christopher Jacobs, present day watchers "will scarcely get a glimmer of a grin" from the film, in spite of the aptitude of its performers. 

The film's topics and its relationship to later works have been the subject of basic investigation. "A Cure for Pokeritis" might be the principal portrayal of poker in film, and gives knowledge into the open's view of the diversion at the time as a male-ruled societal sick. This frame of mind, and a scene like the film's plot, is additionally present in Cassius Marcellus Coolidge's work of art "Sitting up with a Sick Friend", some portion of the "Pooches Playing Poker" arrangement appointed in 1903. "A Cure for Pokeritis" has been contrasted with sitcoms of both the 1940s and the finish of the twentieth century. Film history specialist Wes Gehring of Ball State University believes George to be a precursor of the advanced screw-up paradigm and analyzes the Browns to Laurel and Hardy. Different creators have inspected the film's sex issues. Gerald Mast composed that the comedic viewpoints overlaid a contention among manliness and moralist or women's activist qualities. Brunel University instructor Geoff King saw the male lead's endeavors to escape from a "detaining" spouse to be a repetitive subject in quiet parody, and film analyst Peter Nash found the "picky and feminine" Freddie a case of a contemporary gay stock character.
