California State Route 57 

State Route 57 (SRÂ 57), otherwise called the Orange Freeway for the vast majority of its length, is a northâ south state roadway in the Greater Los Angeles Area of California. It associates the exchange of Interstate 5 (I-5) and SR 22 close downtown Orange, privately known as the Orange Crush, to the Glendora Curve trade with I-210 and SR 210 in Glendora. The roadway gives a course over a few goads of the Peninsular Ranges, connecting the Los Angeles Basin with the Pomona Valley and San Gabriel Valley. 

An ancestor to this street went through Brea Canyon by the mid twentieth century and was added to the state interstate framework. The interstate was worked in stages amid the 1950s, one of which incorporated the Brea Canyon Freeway; SRÂ 57 was assigned as a component of the 1964 state thruway renumbering. The last bit of the present-day Orange Freeway was not finished until the mid 1970s. The most recent bit of SRÂ 57 to be included was in the past piece of I-210, after SRÂ 210 was authoritatively stretched out to San Bernardino in 1998. An unconstructed expansion from Santa Ana south to Huntington Beach stays in the lawful meaning of SRÂ 57, and has been examined as a toll street over the Santa Ana River. 

SRÂ 57 starts at the Orange Crush trade close downtown Orange, where it meets the northwestâ southeast Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) and the eastâ west Garden Grove Freeway (SRÂ 22). The Orange Crush trade, which had for some time been viewed as a noteworthy bottleneck, was reconstructed during the 2000s. The expressway travels north from the intersection and before long crosses toward the west side of the Santa Ana River, proceeding with north through rural bits of Anaheim and going alongside Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center, Angel Stadium and Honda Center. In northern Anaheim, SRÂ 57 meets the Riverside Freeway (SR 91). SRÂ 57 quickly goes through Placentia and Fullerton, giving access to California State University, Fullerton, and The Bruery. As it crosses Imperial Highway (SR 90) close to the Brea Mall and enters Brea, SRÂ 57 enters increasingly rough territory before moving through Brea Canyon, the hole between the Chino Hills and Puente Hills. Close to the edge of the ravine, the thruway bends north out of the Brea Canyon, and slips somewhat to an intersection with the Pomona Freeway (SR 60) in Diamond Bar, directly on the edge of the San Gabriel Valley. 

A short cover conveys SRÂ 57 traffic on a similar roadway as SRÂ 60. The two courses head upper east through an arm of the San Gabriel Valley; after they split, SRÂ 57 rises marginally and afterward inclines through the edge of the Puente Hills and into the west end of the Pomona Valley. Here it meets the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10) and Chino Valley Freeway (SR 71) at the four-level Kellogg Hill Interchange. In the north 50% of that trade, SRÂ 57 enters the San Jose Hills, moving to its most elevated rise before sliding once more into the associated San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys and consummation at the Glendora Curve exchange with the Foothill Freeway (I-210) in Glendora. 

High-inhabitance vehicle paths (HOV) exist in the middle of SRÂ 57 south of SRÂ 60 in Diamond Bar. Raised slopes permit HOV traffic bound to or from Brea Canyon to associate with I-5 towards the southeast, SRÂ 91 towards the west, or SRÂ 60 towards the east without entering the primary paths. 

SRÂ 57 is lawfully qualified for the State Scenic Highway System through Brea Canyon, between SR 90 and SR 60, however it has not authoritatively been assigned as a beautiful parkway by the California Department of Transportation. The whole course is in the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is a turnpike for its whole built length. SRÂ 57 is likewise part of the National Highway System (NHS), a system of thruways that are fundamental to the nation's economy, resistance, and portability. The parkway from SRÂ 1 to SRÂ 60 in Diamond Bar is authoritatively assigned as the Orange Freeway. In 2013, SRÂ 57 had a yearly normal day by day traffic (AADT) of 129,000 among SRÂ 60 and Sunset Crossing Road in Diamond Bar, and 278,500 between SRÂ 91 in Anaheim and Orangethorpe Avenue in Placentia, the last of which was the most elevated AADT for the roadway. 

The street through Brea Canyon was oiled soil by the late 1910s, giving a decent association over an outbranching of the Peninsular Ranges between the Los Angeles Basin and Pomona Valley. This street left the principle coast parkway (Harbor Boulevard) at Fullerton and pursued the present Brea Boulevard and Brea Canyon Road, converging with the Valley Boulevard from Los Angeles close Walnut and proceeding with east to Pomona by means of Valley and Pomona Boulevards. Los Angeles County cleared the street in cement in mid 1923, and in 1931 it was added to the state interstate framework as a part of Route 19. Up to that point, RouteÂ 19 had associated Route 9 close Claremont with Riverside, following Garey Avenue and Mission Boulevard through Pomona. 

The state constructed a detour of the Valley Boulevard segment of the course in the ahead of schedule to-mid-1930s, leaving the old street close Diamond Bar and traveling upper east through the lower regions, along the present expressway arrangement and Mission Boulevard. Toward the south, the lawmaking body included then-inconsequential RouteÂ 180 along State College Boulevard in 1933, interfacing Route 2 (I-5) close to the Santa Ana River with Route 175 (Orangethorpe Avenue, later supplanted by SR 91) close Placentia. By 1955, the Brea Canyon Freeway was proposed to start at the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) close La Veta Avenue in Santa Ana and head north, paralleling Routes 180 and 19 to Pomona. The segment upper east of Diamond Bar into Pomona before long turned out to be a piece of the arranged Pomona Freeway, and the name of the rest of changed to Orange Freeway. The state lawmaking body adjusted the meaning of RouteÂ 19 to mirror this in 1957 by moving its south end to Santa Ana. 

At that point, in 1957, the northernmost piece of present SRÂ 57 was added to the state interstate framework as a feature of Route 240, which the assembly assigned along the course got ready for I-210. This turned out to be a piece of the proposed Temescal Freeway, later the Corona Freeway; a southerly expansion of the Orange Freeway to Legislative Route 60 (SR 1) close Huntington Beach was included 1959 as RouteÂ 273. Additionally in 1959, the governing body made RouteÂ 272, expanding the line of the Orange Freeway north from the Pomona Freeway to the Temescal Freeway, finishing the proposed expressway hall that is presently SRÂ 57. At the point when the whole course, aside from RouteÂ 240 which was still piece of I-210, was redesignated SRÂ 57 in the 1964 renumbering, none of these proposed turnpikes had been manufactured; the main developed fragment was the old surface street from Fullerton towards Pomona. The piece of old RouteÂ 19 east of RouteÂ 272 turned out to be a piece of SR 60. As a major aspect of the equivalent renumbering, RouteÂ 180 on State College Boulevard progressed toward becoming RouteÂ 250, which was corrected the following year to accommodate its cancellation once that bit of the SRÂ 57 interstate was finished (between I-5 and SR 91). 

A noteworthy function was held in Placentia on January 30, 1967, to start development of the Orange Freeway. The principal partition was committed on May 16, 1969, and opened before long, broadening north from the Riverside Freeway (SR 91) to Nutwood Avenue in Fullerton. Throughout the following couple of years, the road was finished from SR 91 north to I-10, and I-210 was manufactured north to the present end of SRÂ 57; the Pomona Freeway (SR 60), which covers it through Diamond Bar, was built in the meantime. The last bits of that partition were the turnpike through Brea Canyon, which opened March 13, 1972, and the four-level Kellogg Hill Interchange at I-10, which was devoted May 1, 1972, and opened before long. At last, the Orange Freeway was stretched out south from SRÂ 91 to I-5 in the mid-1970s, permitting RouteÂ 250 to be swung back to nearby governments, however the ensuing cancellation from the Streets and Highways Code did not happen until 1981. With the expansion of SR 210 around San Bernardino in 1998, the previous easternmost bit of I-210 to the Kellogg Hill Interchange rather turned into a northerly augmentation of SRÂ 57, however it remains authoritatively part of the Interstate Highway System. 

The southerly augmentation to Huntington Beach remains unconstructed. In 1986, Orange County's arrangements were for a toll street raised over the Santa Ana River as opposed to through existing neighborhoods, just stretching out south to the San Diego Freeway (I-405) in Costa Mesa with associations with the Corona del Mar Freeway (SR 73); this was to a great extent enlivened by clog on SR 55 through the Santa Ana territory. The augmentation was considered by Caltrans as two 11.2-mile-long (18.0Â km), two-path viaducts that would cost $950 million. The toll street establishment that American Transportation Development (ATD) held for this part of SR 57 terminated in JanuaryÂ 2001, after a solicitation to postpone the lapse until JanuaryÂ 2007. Following this, ATD sued to reestablish the establishment, and this case endured until NovemberÂ 2003. The end was expected to ATD not starting the development amid the initial ten years of the establishment, after it had been instituted by the state lawmaking body. 

In AprilÂ 2009, the Orange County Transportation Authority kept on examining the augmentation of SRÂ 57, where the turnpike would go along the Santa Ana River and end at I-405 in Fountain Valley. 

The northbound extending between Katella Avenue and SR 91 was done in 2014. To keep the stream of the northbound fifth path which finishes after the Orangewood Avenue exit and continues after the Katella Avenue exit, Caltrans and OCTA plan to augment that 0.5 mile segment of street to include one more path the northbound way.
