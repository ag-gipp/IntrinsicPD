Linklater needed an amiable performing artist for the contemptible job and, while Affleck was "enormous and forcing," he was "so shrewd and brimming with life ... I simply enjoyed him." Affleck later said Linklater was instrumental in demystifying the filmmaking procedure for him. 

Affleck's first featuring film job was as a purposeless workmanship understudy in the school show "Magnificence Daze" (1995), with Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" commenting that his "approachably mopey execution finds only the correct harmony among upsetting and dismal sack". He at that point played a harasser in producer Kevin Smith's satire "Mallrats" (1995), and progressed toward becoming companions with Smith amid the recording. Affleck started to stress that he would be consigned to a vocation of "tossing individuals into their storage spaces", yet Smith place him in the number one spot job in Smith's rom-com "Pursuing Amy" (1997).

"Cooperative attitude Hunting" had not yet been discharged amid the throwing procedure and, after Affleck's screen test, executive Michael Bay rejected him as "a nerd". He was persuaded by maker Jerry Bruckheimer that Affleck would be a star, yet the performer was required to shed pounds, become tanned, and get his teeth topped before recording started. The film, where he featured inverse Bruce Willis as an industrial driller entrusted by NASA with preventing a space rock from crashing into Earth, was a film industry achievement.

Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" asked why on-screen characters like Affleck and Peter O'Toole had consented to show up in the "junky" movie: "Affleck's crashing execution proposes he is perusing his discourse out of the blue, straightforwardly from sign cards." 

Affleck and Damon had an on-screen get-together in Kevin Smith's religious parody "Creed" (subsequent to having showed up in Smith's past movies, "Mallrats" and "Pursuing Amy"), which debuted at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.

I've been doing this for quite a while and he's extremely one of the most delightful." He featured inverse Charlize Theron as a solidified criminal, with Elvis Mitchell of "The New York Times" getting a charge out of the sudden throwing decision: "Affleck regularly proposes one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent ... He looks as though he has never missed a gathering or a night's rest. He's amusement, however, and his slight disengagement attempts to the benefit of "Reindeer Games"." He at that point had a supporting job as a savage stockbroker in the wrongdoing dramatization "Engine compartment" (2000). A.O. Scott of "The New York Times" felt Affleck had "followed over" Alec Baldwin's execution in "Glengarry Glen Ross", while Peter Rainer of "New York Magazine" said he "completes a progression of riffs on Baldwin's aria, and every one is more interesting and crueler than the following". He at that point gave the voice of Joseph in the vivified "". In his last film job of 2000, Affleck featured inverse his sweetheart Paltrow in the sentimental show "Bob". Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" commended the "downplayed power and impeccable detail" of his execution: "His picture of a youthful, mockingly self-characterized 'social butterfly' who isn't half as certain as he might want to show up is near conclusive." 

Affleck rejoined with executive Michael Bay for the basically ridiculed war show "Pearl Harbor" (2001). He later described it as a film he did "for moneyÂ â for the wrong reasons". A.O. Scott of "The New York Times" felt Affleck and Kate Beckinsale "do what they can with their lines, and gleam with the silken sparkle of genuine film stars". In any case, Todd McCarthy of "Assortment" stated, "the tastelessly attractive Affleck couldn't persuade that he'd quite a lot as been turned down for a date, significantly less lost the affection for his life to his closest companion". Affleck then ridiculed "Cooperative attitude Hunting" with Damon and Van Sant in Kevin Smith's "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" (2001), made an appearance in the satire "Daddy and Them" (2001), and had a supporting job in the little-seen "The Third Wheel" (2002). He depicted the CIA investigator Jack Ryan in the spine chiller "The Sum of All Fears" (2002). Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" felt he was miscast in a job recently played by both Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin: "In spite of the fact that Mr. Affleck can be engaging when playing sincere young fellows grabbing toward development, he just comes up short on the gravitas for the job." Affleck had an "astonishing knowledge" making the spine chiller "Switching to another lane" (2002), and later refered to Roger Michell as somebody he gained from as a chief. Robert Koehler of "Assortment" portrayed it as one of the on-screen character's "most altogether created" exhibitions: "The voyage into an ethical haze urges him to play more internally and mindfully than he ever has previously." 

Affleck turned out to be progressively required with TV and film creation in the mid 2000s. He and Damon had set up Pearl Street Films in 1998, named after the road that kept running between their youth homes. Their next generation organization LivePlanet, helped to establish in 2000 with Sean Bailey and Chris Moore, tried to coordinate the Internet into standard TV and film creation. LivePlanet's greatest achievement was the narrative arrangement "Undertaking Greenlight", circulated on HBO and later Bravo, which concentrated on first-time movie producers being allowed to coordinate an element film. "Task Greenlight" was named for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program in 2002, 2004 and 2005. "Push, Nevada" (2002), made, composed and delivered by Affleck and Bailey, was an ABC puzzle dramatization arrangement that set a watcher investment diversion inside the casing of the show. Caryn James of "The New York Times" commended the show's "nerve, creative energy and sharp composition", yet Robert Bianco of "USA Today" portrayed it as a "knock-off" of "Twin Peaks".

Affleck was a long-lasting comic book fan, and had composed a foreword for Kevin Smith's "Gatekeeper Devil" (1999) about his adoration for the character of Daredevil. The film was a business achievement, yet got a blended reaction from faultfinders. Elvis Mitchell of "The New York Times" said Affleck was "lost" in the job: "A major man, Mr. Affleck is withered by the one-dimensional job ... [Only his scenes with Jon Favreau have] a lively side that permits Mr. Affleck to demonstrate his liberality as an on-screen character." In 2014, Affleck portrayed "Adrenaline junkie" as the main film he lamented making. He next showed up as a low-positioning mobster in the lighthearted comedy "Gigli" (2003), co-featuring Lopez. The movie was consistently panned, with Manohla Dargis of the "Los Angeles Times" commenting that "Affleck doesn't have the cleaves or the appeal to move around (or past) terrible material."

Soon thereafter, he featured inverse James Gandolfini in the occasion parody "Enduring Christmas". Holden noted in "The New York Times" that the film "found a cunning method to utilize Ben Affleck's offensive characteristics. The performing artist's shark-like smile, presumptuous testiness and tormenting college kid swagger befit his character." At this point, the nature of contents offered to Affleck "was simply deteriorating and more regrettable" and he chose to take a lifelong break. The "Los Angeles Times" distributed a piece on the defeat of Affleck's vocation in late 2004. The article noticed that, not at all like film commentators and sensationalist writers, "couple of industry experts appear to boast over Affleck's travails". 

Subsequent to wedding performing artist Jennifer Garner in 2005, and respecting their first kid, Affleck started a lifelong rebound in 2006. Following a featuring job in the little-seen "Man About Town" and a minor job in the wrongdoing dramatization "Smokin' Aces", Affleck won approval for his execution as George Reeves in the noir biopic "Hollywoodland". Subside Travers of "Moving Stone" applauded "an honor gauge act ... This is feeling, nuanced work from a performing artist a few of us had rashly discounted."

David Denby of "The New Yorker" pronounced that Affleck "gives his best execution yet", while Richard Corliss of "Time" discovered he "nails Bobby's dive from hubris to embarrassment". 

Following the unassuming business achievement of "Gone Baby Gone", Warner Bros. built up a nearby working association with Affleck and offered him his decision of the studio's contents. He chose to coordinate the wrongdoing show "The Town" (2010), an adjustment of Chuck Hogan's tale "Sovereign of Thieves".

Scott of "The New York Times" lauded his "aptitude and self-assurance as a genuine chief," while Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" noted: "Affleck has the stuff of a genuine executive. Everything is here. It's a successful spine chiller, he works intimately with on-screen characters, he has a vibe for pacing." Also in 2010, Affleck and Damon's creation organization, Pearl Street Films, marked a first-look delivering bargain at Warner Bros.

Anthony Lane of "The New Yorker" said the film offered "additional confirmation that we weren't right about Ben Affleck". Diminish Travers of "Moving Stone" commented: "Affleck makes the following stride in what resembles a noteworthy coordinating profession ... He coordinates the damnation out of it, nailing the reviving pace, the wayward amusingness, the nerve-broiling tension." A noteworthy basic and business achievement, "Argo" won the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture. The cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast.

He at that point pushed back generation all alone directorial venture to star as a spouse blamed for homicide in David Fincher's thrill ride "Gone Girl" (2014). Fincher cast him halfway in light of the fact that he comprehended what it felt like to be distorted by newspaper media: "What numerous individuals don't know is that he's insane brilliant, however since he doesn't need that to get unbalanced, he makes light of it. I think he figured out how to skate on appeal." David Edelstein of "New York Magazine" noticed that Fincher's controlled style of coordinating had a "noteworthy" impact on Affleck's acting: "I never thought I'd compose these words, however he conveys the motion picture. He's astounding." Justin Chang of "Assortment" discovered Affleck "splendidly cast": "It's a precarious turn, requiring a proportion of watchful underplaying and enthusiastic lack of approachability, and he nails it totally."
