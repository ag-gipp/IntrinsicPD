Stan's Uncle Jimbo and his Vietnam War mate Ned take Stan, Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman on a chasing trip in the mountains. As they arrive, Jimbo discloses to the young men how to chase. At whatever point they see an animal, they shoot it in the wake of hollering, "It's coming ideal for us!", so they can guarantee the shooting was in self-preservation. Stan does not have the correct personality to appreciate chasing, and gets himself unfit to shoot a living target. Not at all like Stan, Kenny can shoot creatures, inspiring Jimbo. In the interim, South Park geologist Randy finds that the mountain on which the young men are chasing is a spring of gushing lava that is going to eject. He reports his discoveries to the Mayor, who guides one of her assistants to settle on suitable choices about the emergency. 

Amid the chasing trip, Jimbo announces Kenny his privileged nephew, irritating Stan. At the point when sunsets, Cartman recounts to the narrative of Scuzzlebutt, an animal that has a bit of celery instead of one of its hands and Patrick Duffy for a leg. The young men are incredulous, so Cartman chooses to take on the appearance of the animal the following morning so as to persuade and unnerve them. When he vanishes the following morning, the others set out to discover him. They at that point see Cartman masked as Scuzzlebutt and begin shooting at him. When they make up for lost time with Cartman at the base of the mountain, Stan endeavors to shoot him so as to make up for himself in his uncle's eyes. Notwithstanding, he is unfit to do as such and the postpone gives Cartman time to expel the outfit. At a lower height, Randy requests the South Park occupants to burrow a channel to redirect the magma far from the town. 

Abruptly the fountain of liquid magma emits. The seekers attempt to escape, however end up caught on the opposite side of the channel. The genuine Scuzzlebutt then shows up, and Jimbo apologizes to the young men for their apparently impending passings, just before understanding that Scuzzlebutt is weaving a wicker bin to convey the chasing gathering to wellbeing. The magma at that point moves through the channel similarly as Randy arranged, yet because of an error he made, the channel drives the magma to Denver, pulverizing it. Be that as it may, in a misinformed endeavor to demonstrate he can murder something and inspire his uncle, Stan slaughters Scuzzlebutt. Jimbo is not exactly awed, disclosing to Stan that "a few things you do slaughter and some you don't". Ned states that he presently comprehends the indiscretion of firearms and drops his rifle, which coincidentally shoot, murdering Kenny. Stan does not comprehend, since Jimbo attempted to execute Scuzzlebutt before and different creatures and needed to inspire Jimbo like Kenny did, Jimbo brings up that Kenny is dead and that Stan will dependably be Jimbo's nephew. At long last, the young men choose that chasing is inept and befuddling, hence chose to return home to watch kid's shows. 

"Fountain of liquid magma" was composed and coordinated by arrangement co-makers Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The scene was enlivened by fountain of liquid magma related Hollywood calamity films, for example, "Dante's Peak" (1997) and "Spring of gushing lava" (1997), which turned out around the time they were composing the content; Parker and Stone considered the movies two of the most noticeably awful at any point made. Stone stated, "On the off chance that you watch this scene and, at that point go watch "Well of lava", this bodes well than "Spring of gushing lava" does." Debbie Liebling, who filled in as a "South Park" maker at the season of the scene's communicated, said the fountain of liquid magma emitting in South Park built up the setting as a spot where "anything can occur". Albeit Stone and Parker recognized that a well of lava couldn't really emit in this Colorado town, they believed they were qualified for make the scene at any rate in light of the fact that the "Fountain of liquid magma" film was set in Los Angeles; Stone stated, "In the event that they could do it, we could." Similarly, the pair recognize the passage worked in the scene would not by any stretch of the imagination redirect the magma, however they included it since Parker stated, "Any motion picture today, that is fundamentally how moronic they are." 

Another effect on the plot was the huge measure of chasing Parker and Stone saw around them while experiencing childhood in Colorado. Neither of them were seekers, and Parker said Stan's wavering regarding chasing depended to a great extent on himself and his dad, who abhorred executing a creature despite the fact that Parker's granddad, as Jimbo, was energetic about the game. Parker said he feels huge numbers of the principal season scenes considered forbidden in 1997 would have been viewed as less disputable five years after the fact, however that "Spring of gushing lava" is an exemption. Since the scene included kids drinking brew and compromising each other at gunpoint amid chasing trips, Parker said he didn't trust Comedy Central would have broadcast it following the Columbine High School slaughter in 1999. Parker stated, "In those days, it was simply kind of clever, kids pointing weapons at one another, and it's simply not all that amusing at this point." 

"South Park" illustrators spent the initial four scenes of the show endeavoring to consummate the liveliness of the characters. By "Fountain of liquid magma" â which was created after "Weight Gain 4000" â , Parker and Stone felt the surfaces were improved, just as littler subtleties like the lines around the eyes of the characters. While the arrangement pilot "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" was vivified with development paper, ensuing scenes were made utilizing PCs. All things considered, Parker and Stone needed the show to keep up its unrefined paper look; for instance, they explicitly requested the night sky in this scene to resemble a dark bit of paper with gaps cut into it for stars, similarly as it was in the pilot scene. Stone and Parker were particularly glad for the liveliness of the magma, which they said took hours to consummate, despite the fact that they recognized it wound up essentially taking after orange development paper. The magma ball shooting out of the fountain of liquid magma and practically murdering Kenny was legitimately propelled by the "Spring of gushing lava" film. Parker and Stone concocted the character of Scuzzlebutt amid an irregular discussion with Comedy Central official Debbie Liebling. While meeting with her, they essentially begun illustration the character, and chose to include a celery hand and Patrick Duffy leg for no specific reason. Scuzzlebutt additionally showed up in a second scene, "City on the Edge of Forever" from the second season. Scuzzlebutt ending up being a genuine character as opposed to a strange story was the principal occurrence of a typical normal for the Cartman character, in which Cartman says ridiculous and totally improbable things that end up being valid. Stone remarked, "He's correct more regularly than he's off-base." 

The "Fountain of liquid magma" scene was underway when "South Park" appeared on August 13, 1997. Fun times TV officials did not article to the greater part of the substance of the scene, yet said the scene in which Kyle flatulated while conversing with Stan ought to have been expelled in light of the fact that nothing occurred after the fart, and they said it was not entertaining. Parker and Stone, in any case, demanded it remain in the scene, and they said the absence of any response at all to the fart was what made it entertaining. Amid close-ups of Cartman's face while recounting to the narrative of Scuzzlebutt around the pit fire, the flares from the flame quit moving. Parker and Stone saw the consistency mistake after the scene was taped, yet they didn't have enough time to return and fix it before the communicate date, so it was left in. A feline highlighted out of sight of one of the open air scenes was intended to look precisely like Parker's feline, Jake. The scene in which Ned bursts into flames depended on an encounter Parker had amid a Colorado outdoors trip where he endeavored to complete an "Indian Fire Trick", in which one pours fuel onto a flame to make extensive flares. Despite the fact that no one burst into flames, Parker said the trap fizzled and he almost torched the backwoods. In the wake of completing the scene, Parker and Stone acknowledged "Well of lava" was around two minutes shorter than the time length required for the scene. So as to add time to the scene, Parker and Stone included the scene with Ned singing the melody "Kumbaya" around the flame, just as the long stop outline on a stunned Chef and Mayor McDaniels responding to the updates on the spring of gushing lava's inescapable emission. 

Notwithstanding Scuzzlebutt, "Well of lava" incorporated the primary appearances of repeating characters Randy Marsh and Ned Gerblanski. In this first appearance, Randy is recognized just as the South Park geologist, and it is just in the scene "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" that he is first presented as Stan's dad. Parker, who gives the voice of Randy Marsh, said the plan, voice, and identity of the character depend on his genuine dad, who fills in as a geologist for the United States Geological Survey. Parker said his dad is quiet, all things considered, and Randy's casual response to learning of the spring of gushing lavaâserenely tasting his espressoâis "about how my father would respond to anything". The appearance of the Ned character depended on an attracting Parker made secondary school, despite the fact that the character did not initially have a voice box. The voice was roused by a server who worked at a Kentucky Fried Chicken eatery in Boulder, Colorado, where Parker and Stone would visit while going to the University of Colorado. The pair said they would go to the eatery just to hear her voice, however that it was so low they would lose their craving when she took their requests. Stone and Parker experienced difficulty making the correct voice for the character; they had a go at putting the mouthpiece legitimately on their throat, and furthermore purchased a genuine voice box, in any case chose that the most ideal approach to furnish the character's voice was with characteristic voice recreation.

The film was roused by real "Duck and Cover" films from the 1960s, in which youngsters were told to stow away under tables or incline toward dividers on account of an atomic weapon assault; Parker and Stone, in the same way as other faultfinders of the movies, found the strategies horrendously shortsighted and did not trust they would really help on account of such an assault. Jimbo and Ned are portrayed as veterans of the Vietnam War, the military clash between North Vietnam and South Vietnam that endured from 1959 to 1975; Cartman, who is extremely youthful to have taken an interest in the war, cases to have flashbacks to his encounters in it. Patrick Duffy, the American TV on-screen character best known for his jobs in the shows "Dallas" and "Well ordered", shows up in the scene as the living leg of Scuzzlebutt. Matt Stone asserted there was no specific reason Duffy was picked as the leg aside from that he is such a dull on-screen character: "He's simply too tasteless. Like, how would you be able to perhaps be a devotee of Patrick Duffy?" 

The scene where Scuzzlebutt puts a star over a tree is a reference to a comparable scene in the 1964 TV uncommon "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer", in which the Abominable Snow Monster puts a Christmas star on an extensive tree. Mount Evanston, the anecdotal mountain in "Spring of gushing lava", was named after the genuine Mount Evans in the Front Range district of the Rocky Mountains in Clear Creek County, Colorado; Nichols Canyon in the scene was named after Kirt Nichols, a companion of Trey Parker. Jimbo reprimands the Democratic Party for passing excessively prohibitive laws on seekers and firearm proprietors. After learning youngsters are in risk because of the well of lava, Mayor McDaniels looks for exposure for herself by reaching the TV news programs "Excitement Tonight" and "Inside Edition". 

A few lines of exchange from "Well of lava" turned out to be particularly prominent among "South Park" fans, including "It's coming appropriate for us!" by Jimbo, and the two Cartman lines, "Democrats irritate me!" and "Kid's shows Kick Ass!", the remainder of which was highlighted on T-shirts. Regardless of the generally little job Scuzzlebutt played in the arrangement, he by the by turned into a well known minor "South Park" character.
