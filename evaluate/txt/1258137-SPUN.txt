Ontario Highway 416 

Ruler's Highway 416, generally alluded to as Highway 416 and as the Veterans Memorial Highway, is a 400-arrangement parkway in the Canadian region of Ontario that interfaces the Trans-Canada Highway (HighwayÂ 417) in Ottawa with HighwayÂ 401 among Brockville and Cornwall. The road goes about as a critical exchange hallway from Interstate 81 between New York and Eastern Ontario by means of HighwayÂ 401, just as the quickest connection among Ottawa and Toronto. HighwayÂ 416 goes through a generally rustic zone, with the exception of close to its northern end where it enters suburbia of Ottawa. The turnpike likewise serves a few networks along its length, remarkably Spencerville and Kemptville. 

HighwayÂ 416 had two particular development stages. HighwayÂ 416 "North" was the section beginning from a trade at HighwayÂ 417 and bypassing the first course of HighwayÂ 16 into Ottawa (presently Prince of Wales Drive) along another option to proceed. HighwayÂ 416 "South" was the twinning of HighwayÂ 16Â Newâa two-path interstate developed all through the 1970s and completed in 1983 that skirted the first roadwayâand the development of another exchange with HighwayÂ 401. Areas of both opened all through the late 1990s. HighwayÂ 416 was recognized as the Veterans Memorial Highway on the 54th commemoration of D-Day in 1998. The last connection was authoritatively opened by a World War I veteran and nearby authorities on SeptemberÂ 23, 1999. 

HighwayÂ 416 starts at a trade with HighwayÂ 401, stretching toward the north close to the network of Johnstown in the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville. This exchange just gives access to and from the west of HighwayÂ 401, however promptly north of it, a second trade with the rest of the area of HighwayÂ 16 gives access from Johnstown and to a parclo trade with the two headings of HighwayÂ 401, just as to the Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge intersection to Ogdensburg, New York. 

Continuing north, the two carriageways of the turnpike are isolated by a forested middle. 

The course is encompassed by thick timberlands for the following . As it goes underneath Leeds and Grenville County RoadÂ 44, the first directing of HighwayÂ 16 (the Prescott Highway) south of Spencerville, it leaves the backwoods and enters ranch fields. The course goes toward the east of the network, access to which is given by a trade at County RoadÂ 21, and crosses a bog and the South Nation River. 

HighwayÂ 416 crosses under the Prescott Highway a second time; toward the north, the two remain generally parallel however isolated as they go through a blend of farmland and woods. South of the network of Kemptville, the Prescott Highway crosses the highway a third time, with a trade interfacing the two thruways. 

The turnpike bends toward the upper east, bypassing Kemptville and including an exchange with County RoadÂ 43 (once in the past HighwayÂ 43). 

It goes too far of the old Bytown and Prescott Railway, 

at that point bends toward the northwest, furnishing a trade with River Road. At the southeast corner of the River Road exchange is the Veterans Commemorative Park, committed in 2000 by the Royal Canadian Legion. 

It crosses the Rideau River and enters the City of Ottawa. Beside the principal couple of kilometers north of the Rideau River, most of the interstate slices through swaths of farmland which fill the Ottawa Valley. The middle likewise progresses toward becoming smaller. The expressway experiences a trade with Dilworth Road and from that point with Roger Stevens Drive, the last giving access to North Gower. 

Proceeding with north of Manotick through fields, HighwayÂ 416 is crossed by the Prescott Highway for the fourth and last time as that street transforms upper east and goes into downtown Ottawa as Prince of Wales Drive. Presently is an exchange with Brophy Drive/Bankfield Road; the last gives access to the Prescott Highway/Prince of Wales Drive. Moving toward urban Ottawa, the course goes nearby an expansive quarry, at that point runs toward the west along a S-bend, crossing the Jock River all the while. After this, a trade with Fallowfield Road gives access to the suburb of Barrhaven which involves segments of the land quickly east of the expressway. The course runs back toward the east along a second S-bend and goes through a stylishly structured scaffold while going close by the Stony Swamp. 

The last area of HighwayÂ 416 ventures out parallel to Cedarview Road, which was moved for the expressway. The Stony Swamp lies west of the course while farmland deceives the east. At the northern end of the marsh is an exchange with West Hunt Club Road. The road proceeds through a segment of greenspace before dropping tenderly into a channel. It goes underneath Bruin Road and the Ottawa Central Railway while going close by Lynwood Village in Bells Corners. The interstate is crossed by Baseline Road and Richmond Road; the previous gives an onramp to southbound HighwayÂ 416. The expressway closes at an expansive exchange with the Trans-Canada Highway, HighwayÂ 417 (ExitÂ 131), only south of the Lakeview and Bayshore people group on the Ottawa River; downtown Ottawa is toward the east and Kanata is toward the west. 

The Stony Swamp bridge at the southern access to Ottawa is a pre-tensioned solid curve; the plan, which enables the structure to cross the whole option to proceed with a solitary range, won the 1996 Award of Excellence from the Portland Cement Association. The scaffold goes about as a portal to the National Capital Region and is the longest unbending casing span in Ontario with a range. 

In a similar region, the road sinks subterranean dimension in a channel; groundwater-holding dividers were introduced to keep the bringing down of the water table in adjoining wetlands, in this manner alleviating harm to them. 

At the Jock River, southwest of Barrhaven, stores of touchy leda dirt exhibited a test in structuring the intersection for the expressway just as the Canadian National Railway bridge toward the north. It was expected that the heaviness of these structures could destabilize the earth stores underneath and lead to avalanches. Instead of the standard heavier total, lighter impact heater slag, at a large portion of the weight, was substituted. 

Inclined shake cuts line the side of the expressway in various areas. With the plan of lessening the seriousness of impacts against those cuts, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) tried out various choices to strike an expense to-profit balance. The standard slant utilized by the MTO is vertical, counterbalanced from the edge of the asphalt by . The examination reasoned that despite the fact that an at first higher venture would be required, the 2:1 slanted cut with grass overlaid delivered the best outcomes. 

In 1966, the Department of Highways (DHO), antecedent to the present MTO, distributed the Eastern Ontario Highway Planning Study, distinguishing the requirement for a controlled-get to interstate among Ottawa and HighwayÂ 401. 

HighwayÂ 16, which ignores the topographically curbed St.Â Lawrence Lowlands, was chosen over HighwayÂ 15, which crosses the undulating Canadian Shield toward the west, as the perfect course for the new connection. 

HighwayÂ 16 was one of the main streets taken over by the extending Department of Public Highways in 1918. The critical passageway between the Trans-common Highway (HighwayÂ 2) and Ottawa was known as the Prescott Highway. In 1925, the street was given a numerical assignment to enhance the name. 

This expressway served the low traffic volumes of the day, however as the quantity of vehicles expanded over the main portion of the 20thÂ century, issues emerged with the various private carports along the course. To conquer this issue of adjoining properties since quite a while ago settled on the old HighwayÂ 16 hallway, the DHO started buying another option to proceed among HighwayÂ 401 and Century Road by late 1967 for a two-path sidestep of the first arrangement, evading all the developed zones that the first HighwayÂ 16 experienced. This course was intended to effectively suit the possible move up to a turnpike when traffic volumes required. 

Development of the excessively two, named "Thruway 16 New", occurred somewhere in the range of 1969 and 1983. The Spencerville Bypass opened by 1971, interfacing with the old thruway in the south close Crowder Road and in the north close Ventnor Road. 

Before the finish of 1973, the new thruway was finished from quickly north of HighwayÂ 401 through Leeds and Grenville United Counties and into Ottawaâ Carleton. This incorporated a detour around Kemptville and another structure over the Rideau River. The new parkway finished at Dilworth Road (Regional RoadÂ 13). 

For about 10 years, no new development occurred. At that point, amid the late spring of 1982, the MTO granted an agreement to build the course north from Dilworth Road towards Manotick, bypassing North Gower and broadening the course as far north as Roger Stevens Drive (Regional RoadÂ 6), including a structure over Stevens Creek. Following fulfillment of this first contract, a second contract was granted for the rest of the separation north to Century Road (Regional RoadÂ 8). 

The task was finished in 1983, converging into the first course of HighwayÂ 16 upper east of the present Prince of Wales Drive bridge. 

With the fruition of HighwayÂ 16 New, the MTO required just to build trades and the southbound paths so as to make a full interstate hall. The move up to HighwayÂ 416 occurred somewhere in the range of 1989 and 1999 and was helped out through two separate tasks: Highway 416 North was a turnpike on another arrangement through Ottawa and an exchange at HighwayÂ 417, and HighwayÂ 416 South was the twinning of HighwayÂ 16 New and a trade at HighwayÂ 401. 

The first designs for HighwayÂ 416, considered amid the late 1960s, had it enter Ottawa along the "Merivale Corridor" to converge with the Queensway roughly east of the present exchange. Be that as it may, when it came time to develop this segment, open dispositions had moved and natural concerns had gone to the cutting edge of regular day to day existence; new streets were currently subject to extreme open examination. Rural areas developed along Merivale Road, provoking the Region of Ottawaâ Carleton to demand the MTO decommission the option to proceed along the street in 1977, which it did. The death of the Environmental Assessment Act in 1975, be that as it may, implied that new tasks were liable to a protracted examination of social and ecological concerns. 

In 1981, the MTO started an ecological appraisal into another arrangement for the northern association with the Queensway. It was affirmed in mid-1987, with Cedarview Drive picked as the perfect arrangement for the new expressway. The MTO set out to plan a four-path course to interface the Queensway with HighwayÂ 16 New, including a three-level free-stream exchange. An agreement for development of this exchange was granted in late 1989 and development started in 1990. Amid the 1991 development season, contracts were granted to build a few bridges along the new course. 

This agreement was finished in 1993, after which budgetary limitations kept the granting of further contracts. Therefore, beside the exchange at HighwayÂ 417 and a few bridges, development action on HighwayÂ 416 ground to a halt for a long time. 

It was amid this period that the MTO attempted a building audit of the whole course looking for cost wasteful aspects. Roadways 416 and 407 were built amid a retreat in the mid-1990s. HighwayÂ 407 turned into a tolled parkway and for a period it was referenced in authoritative discussions that HighwayÂ 416 would likewise be tolled, at the end of the day this never occurred. Rather, a break in development enabled architects to assess wasteful aspects in extension and cross-area plans, just as touchy mud soils close Ottawa. This activity prompted a cost reserve funds of over C$7 million and a few of the exceptional structure highlights situated along the length of the road. 

Work continued on HighwayÂ 416 North after the audit. It was opened from Century Road to Hunt Club Road on JulyÂ 16, 1996, and finished on JulyÂ 31, 1997, with the opening of the trade with Highway 417. The expense of this area was C$196 million. On DecemberÂ 8, 1995, in North Gower, the common and central governments reported a financing arrangement to guarantee HighwayÂ 416 South was finished by 2000. 

This area of the course was developed through a procedure known as twinning in which a second carriageway is manufactured parallel to a current street. Moreover, existing crossing points were reconstructed as level isolated trades. 

With the option to proceed along HighwayÂ 16 New previously obtained, development had the capacity to continue without disturbance to neighborhood properties or traffic. 

The undertaking was developed through five contracts. The first was granted to Tarmac Canada on JuneÂ 10, 1996, calling for twinning of from Century Road south to Roger Stevens Drive. Another agreement was granted after one month to Bot Construction, on AugustÂ 19. This agreement included the area from Roger Stevens Drive south to what was then HighwayÂ 43, a separation of . On JuneÂ 12, 1997, the principal segment opened, interfacing with the Ottawa Bypass at Century Road. 

On JulyÂ 10, the third contract was granted to Armbro Construction to build the area from HighwayÂ 43 south to Grenville County RoadÂ 20 (Oxford Station Road). Another agreement pursued on OctoberÂ 21 for the south to Grenville County RoadÂ 20 (Shanly Road) which was granted to Bot Construction. The fifth and last contract was granted to Armbro Construction on AprilÂ 8, 1998, requiring the development of the southern and the two flyover inclines at HighwayÂ 401. The area between Roger Stevens Drive and what had now moved toward becoming Leeds and Grenville County RoadÂ 43, including a second intersection of the Rideau River, opened to traffic on JuneÂ 26, 1998. 

This was pursued two months after the fact by the segment among HighwayÂ 43 and Oxford Station Road, which opened on AugustÂ 24. 

On the fifty-fourth commemoration of D-Day, JuneÂ 6, 1998, at that point Transportation Minister Tony Clement revealed two signs in Ottawa and formally announced the whole length of HighwayÂ 416 as the Veterans Memorial Highway, notwithstanding prior hesitance from past clergyman Al Palladini. 

Six extra signs were additionally introduced along the length of the course. 

At the time, the Veterans Memorial Parkway in London previously existed. From that point forward, two extra veterans roadways have been named: on OctoberÂ 20, 2002, the Veterans Highway was assigned in Halton Region along Regional RoadÂ 25; 

on SeptemberÂ 23, 2010, the Niagara Veterans Memorial Highway was assigned in Niagara Falls along Regional RoadÂ 420. 

A function was held in Johnstown on SeptemberÂ 23, 1999 to open the last segment of HighwayÂ 416 that would total the connection from HighwayÂ 401 to HighwayÂ 417. Chief Mike Harris, Transportation Minister David Turnbull and World War I Veteran James W. Fraser formally opened the parkway. 

On December 14, 2009, there was a 60â 70 vehicle accident because of haze and frosty conditions, driving the conclusion of the parkway in the two headings.
