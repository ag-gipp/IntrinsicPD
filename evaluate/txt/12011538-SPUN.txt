SMS "Kaiser Barbarossa" (His Majesty's Ship "Head Barbarossa") was a German pre-man of war vessel of the . The ship was worked for the Imperial Navy, which had started a program of extension at the heading of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Development occurred at Schichau, in Danzig. "Kaiser Barbarossa" was set down in August 1898, propelled on 21 April 1900, and dispatched in June 1901, at the expense of 20,301,000 imprints. The ship was outfitted with a primary battery of four weapons within two twin firearm turrets. 

"Kaiser Barbarossa" presented with the German naval force from her appointing in 1901, however her dynamic vocation was restricted by two protracted remains in dry dock. The first was for fixes following harm to her rudder in 1903, which endured until mid 1905, and the second for a noteworthy modernization, which started following the finish of fix work in 1905 and kept going until late 1907. She came back to support for an additional two years, before being decommissioned in 1909 and put in the Reserve Division. She kept on taking an interest in armada preparing practices for the following three years. 

Following the episode of World War I in August 1914, "Kaiser Barbarossa" and her sisters were assembled as beach front resistance sends in the V Battle Squadron and relegated toward the North and Baltic Seas. She saw no battle amid the war and, because of a deficiency of groups, the boats were pulled back from dynamic obligation in February 1915 and consigned to auxiliary obligations. "Kaiser Barbarossa" was quickly utilized as a torpedo target transport for the vast majority of 1915 and from that point spent the rest of the war as a jail send in Wilhelmshaven. Following the finish of the war in 1918, "Kaiser Barbarossa" was decommissioned and sold for scrap metal. The ship was separated in 1919â 20. 

After the German "Kaiserliche Marine" (Imperial Navy) requested the four s in 1889, a blend of budgetary requirements, restriction in the "Reichstag" (Imperial Diet), and an absence of an intelligent armada plan postponed the securing of further war vessels. The Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt" (Imperial Navy Office), "Vizeadmiral" (Vice Admiral) Friedrich von Hollmann battled all through the early-and mid-1890s to verify parliamentary endorsement for the s, yet in June 1897, Hollmann was supplanted by "Konteradmiral" (Rear Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz, who immediately proposed and verified endorsement for the principal Naval Law in mid 1898. The law approved the last two boats of the class, "Kaiser Barbarossa" and . 

"Kaiser Barbarossa" was long by and large and had a light emission a draft of forward and rearward. She uprooted up to at full burden. The ship was fueled by three 3-barrel vertical triple-extension steam motors, each driving one screw propeller. Steam was given by four Thornycroft boilers and eight round and hollow boilers, all of which consumed coal. "Kaiser Barbarossa"s powerplant was appraised at , which created a top speed of . The ship had a cruising sweep of at a speed of . She had an ordinary team of 39 officers and 612 enrolled men. 

The ship's deadly implement comprised of a principle battery of four 24Â cm (9.4Â in) SK L/40 weapons in twin firearm turrets, one fore and one toward the back of the focal superstructure. Her auxiliary weapon comprised of eighteen 15Â cm (5.9Â inch) SK L/40 firearms, twelve 8.8Â cm (3.45Â in) SK L/30 fast shooting firearms all mounted in casemates, and twelve machine gun in single mounts. The deadly implement suite was adjusted with six torpedo tubes, all in above-water swivel mounts. The ship's belt protection was thick, and the deck was thick. The conning tower and fundamental battery turrets were secured with of defensive layer plating, and the auxiliary casemates got of reinforcement assurance. 

Kaiser Wilhelm II, the Emperor of Germany, trusted that a solid naval force was fundamental for the nation to extend its impact outside mainland Europe. Thus, he started a program of maritime development in the late 1880s; the main war vessels worked under this program were the four "Brandenburg"- class ships. These were promptly trailed by the five "Kaiser Friedrich III"- class warships, of which "Kaiser Barbarossa" was a part. "Kaiser Barbarossa"s bottom was set down on 3 August 1898, at the Schichau-Werke in Danzig, under development number 640. She was requested under the agreement name "An" as an expansion to the armada. "Kaiser Barbarossa" was propelled on 21 April 1900. The at that point "Vizeadmiral" Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt", gave the starting discourse, and the new ship was initiated by Princess Luise Sofie of Prussia, Wilhelm II's sister-in-law. Ocean preliminaries started on 4 May 1901, amid which two tests were recorded: a 50-hour continuance test and a 6-hour speed test. The previous created a supported speed of , while the last observed a most extreme speed of , and on 10 June she was dispatched into the armada in Kiel. The last expense of the vessel was 20,301,000 imprints. 

Following her authorizing, "Kaiser Barbarossa" was appointed to the I Squadron of the "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet), which presently went on a voyage to Spain. While moored in CÃ¡diz, the boats met the four "Brandenburg"- class ships, which were coming back from their campaign to smother the Boxer Rebellion in China. From 22 August to 21 September, "Kaiser Barbarossa" took an interest in the yearly pre-winter moves of the whole armada. While in the Danzig Bay, the armada led a maritime survey for the meeting Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, whose spouse Alexandra was Wilhelm's cousin. The winter journey in December went to southern Norway. In April and May 1902, the squadron went on a preparation journey to Britain, trailed by a voyage through the Kiel Week cruising regatta in late June. The boats at that point partook in another preparation journey to Norway in July and afterward the pre-winter moves, which started in the Baltic and deduced in the North Sea with an armada audit in the Jade. Amid the activity, which kept going from 17 August to 18 September, "Kaiser Barbarossa" and the remainder of I Squadron were alloted to assume the jobs of both the German armada and threatening powers. The typical winter journey went to Bergen, Norway, that year. 

In 1903 the armada, which was made out of just a single squadron of current warships, was rearranged as the "Dynamic Battle Fleet". "Kaiser Barbarossa" stayed in the I Squadron alongside her sister ships and the most current s, while the more established "Brandenburg"- class ships were submitted for possible later use in request to be modified. The main quarter of 1903 pursued the standard example of preparing works out. The squadron went on a preparation journey in the Baltic, trailed by a voyage to Spain that endured from 7 May to 10 June. The ship endured some harm to her rudder, which required brief fixes at the "Kaiserliche Werft" (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel from the finish of July to 21 August. She from that point participated in the fall moves and the winter journey in the eastern Baltic and the Skagerrak. The harvest time moves comprised of a barricade practice in the North Sea, a voyage of the whole armada first to Norwegian waters and after that to Kiel toward the beginning of September, lastly a fake assault on Kiel. The activities closed on 12 September. The winter preparing journey started on 23 November in the eastern Baltic and proceeded into the Skagerrak toward the beginning of December. On 15 December, "Kaiser Barbarossa" was decommissioned for perpetual fixes to her rudder, which kept going until January 1905. At the point when the fixes were done, she didn't come back to support, be that as it may, and rather started a noteworthy remaking. 

Amid the modernization, four of her 15Â cm weapons were evacuated and two 8.8Â cm firearms were included. Every one of the twelve 1-pounder weapons were evacuated, just like the ship's stern-mounted torpedo tube. "Kaiser Barbarossa"s superstructure was additionally chopped down to lessen the ship's propensity to move too much and her military poles were supplanted with lighter post poles. The ship's channels were additionally extended. "Kaiser Barbarossa"s modernization was finished by 1 October 1907, when she was recommissioned for administration. At that point, the most up to date s were coming into administration; alongside the s, these gave enough present day war vessels to make two full fight squadrons. Thusly, the "Heimatflotte" was renamed the "Hochseeflotte" (High Seas Fleet). "Kaiser Barbarossa" came back to her place in the I Squadron and she took an interest in the ordinary daily schedule of divisional, squadron, and armada moves and travels without episode throughout the following year. The mid year armada journey in May that year went to the Azores and came back to Kiel on 13 August. The harvest time moves kept going from 27 August to 7 September. Divisional activities in the Baltic promptly pursued from 7 to 13 September. 

On 17 September 1909, "Kaiser Barbarossa" was decommissioned and doled out to the Reserve Division in the Baltic Sea. At that point, the new gunboat war vessels, which rendered "Kaiser Barbarossa" and her sister transports altogether out of date, were starting to come into administration with the armada. In mid 1910, "Kaiser Barbarossa" was relegated to the Training Squadron, which worked in the Baltic in April. She was reactivated to take an interest in the harvest time moves that year in the temporary III Squadron; after the finish of the activities on 10 September, she was set back available for later. More modernization work was done at the "Kaiserliche Werft" in Kiel. From 31 July to 15 September, she was reactivated again to participate in the harvest time moves in the III Squadron. She from that point came back to the Reserve Division in mid 1912. 

Because of the flare-up of World War I, "Kaiser Barbarossa" and her sisters were brought out of hold and activated as the V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914. The boats were set up for war in all respects gradually, and they were not prepared for administration in the North Sea until the finish of August. They were at first entrusted with beach front protection, however they served in this limit with regards to a brief timeframe. In mid-September, the V Squadron was exchanged to the Baltic, under the direction of Prince Heinrich. He at first wanted to dispatch a noteworthy land and/or water capable attack on Windau, yet a lack of transports constrained an update of the arrangement. Rather, the V Squadron was to convey the arrival compel, yet this too was dropped after Heinrich got bogus reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. "Kaiser Barbarossa" and her sisters came back to Kiel the next day, landed the arrival power, and after that continued toward the North Sea, where they continued gatekeeper deliver obligations. Prior as far as possible of the year, the V Squadron was by and by exchanged to the Baltic. 

Subsequent to coming back to the Baltic, Prince Heinrich requested an attack toward Gotland. On 26 December 1914, the war vessels rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and after that withdrew on the fight. After two days, the armada landed off Gotland to demonstrate the German banner, and was back in Kiel by 30 December. The squadron came back toward the North Sea for gatekeeper obligations, however was pulled back from bleeding edge administration in February 1915. Deficiencies of prepared teams in the High Seas Fleet, combined with the danger of working more seasoned ships in wartime, required the deactivation of "Kaiser Barbarossa" and her sisters. Her team was diminished on 5 March, just to be supplanted on 11 April so the ship could be utilized as a torpedo target transport; this administration endured until 9 November. After ten days, she was decommissioned once and for all, and in 1916 she was incapacitated. "Kaiser Barbarossa" was from that point utilized as a coasting jail for detainees of war in Wilhelmshaven. In November 1918, Germany looked for a conclusion to the war and marked the First Armistice at CompiÃ¨gne, which briefly finished threats so a harmony bargain could be arranged. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which formally finished the war and was marked on 28 June 1919, Germany was allowed to hold just six warships of the ""Deutschland" or types". In like manner, the ship was struck from the maritime rundown on 6 December 1919 and sold to dispatch breakers. "Kaiser Barbarossa" was separated for scrap metal in RÃ¼stringen in 1919 and 1920.
