Faultfinders adulated the amusement's designs, novel ongoing interaction components, and multiplayer framework, however sentiments were partitioned on the diversion's plot and high trouble. The diversion sold more than 500,000 duplicates in its initial a half year, and got a few honors and selections for best system round of the year and best round of the year. An arrival of the amusement's source code in 2003 started informal ports to macOS and Linux, and three additional recreations in the "Homeworld" arrangement have been created: "" (2000), "Homeworld 2" (2003), and "" (2016). Gearbox Software bought the rights to the arrangement from that point proprietors THQ in 2013, and discharged a remastered accumulation of "Homeworld" and "Homeworld 2" in 2015 for Windows and macOS which was likewise exceptionally respected. 

"Homeworld" is a constant system amusement set in space. Interactivity, as in most continuous methodology titles, is centered around social event assets, building military powers, and utilizing them to decimate foe powers and achieve a target. The amusement incorporates both single-player and multiplayer modes; the single-player mode comprises of one story-driven crusade, separated into levels. In each dimension, the player has a goal to achieve before they can end the dimension, however a definitive target of the mission can change as the dimension's story unfurls. Between every one of the 16 levels is a hand-drawn, high contrast cutscene with story voiceovers. 

The focal ship of the player's armada is the mothership, a vast base which can develop different boats; in contrast to other rocket, in the single-player battle the mothership is unfit to move. Present in each dimension are stationary shakes or residue mists, which can be mined by particular gathering ships which at that point void their heaps at the mothership as "assets", the amusement's solitary money. Assets can be spent by the player on structure new ships, which are built by the mothership. Buildable boats arrive in an assortment of sorts, which are found through the span of the amusement. They incorporate asset gatherer ships, little contender ships, frigates, destroyers, and substantial cruisers, just as specific ships, for example, investigate vessels and fix corvettes. Contender ships need to come back to the mothership intermittently to refuel, while rescue corvettes can catch adversary ships and tow them to the mothership to turn out to be a piece of the player's armada. In certain dimensions, new ship types can be opened by catching a foe ship of that type, through research performed at the examination vessel, or through plot components. Toward the start of the battle, the player may choose between controlling the "Kushan" or "Taiidan" armada; this influences the structures of the boats and changes a portion of the specific ship alternatives, however has no impact on the plot or ongoing interaction. 

Each dimension's playable zone is a circle, separated by a roundabout plane. Boats can be coordinated to move anyplace in that circle, either independently or in gatherings. The diversion's camera can be set to pursue any ship and view them from any edge, just as presentation the ship's perspective. The player may likewise see the "Sensors Manager", wherein they can see the whole diversion map alongside every single unmistakable ship. Boats can be assembled into arrangements, for example, wedges or circles, so as to furnish strategic points of interest amid battle with adversary ships. Non-particular boats are furnished with weapons to shoot upon adversary ships, which incorporate ballistic firearms, shaft weapons, and rockets. As a ship is harmed by weapons its wellbeing bar exhausts, enhanced visualizations, for example, discharge and smoke are included, and it can in the long run detonate. 

At the point when all mission goals are finished, the player is given the alternative to make a hyperspace bounce to end the dimension. This might be delayed so as to assemble more assets or fabricate more ships. At the point when the hyperspace hop is started, all warriors come back to the mothership while bigger boats line up beside it, and blue square shapes ignore the boats and transport them to the following dimension. The player holds their armada among levels, and the trouble of every mission is changed in accordance with a little degree dependent on what number of boats are in the player's armada toward the start of each dimension. In multiplayer recreations, the goal is normally to obliterate the foe motherships, however other fight arranged triumph conditions are accessible. The mothership is fit for development, and as there are no dimensions, the examination done at the exploration vessel pursues an innovation tree with each overhaul or ship configuration taking a set measure of time, instead of likewise being subject to a plot point. Different maps are accessible, as are choices to kill the need to look into advances or fuel utilization for littler boats. 

A century preceding the beginning of the amusement, the Kushan, humanoid occupants of the desert planet Kharak, found a spaceship covered in the sands, which holds a stone guide checking Kharak and another planet over the cosmic system named "Hiigara", signifying "home". The disclosure joined the families of Kharak, who realized they were not indigenous to Kharak and needed to illuminate the riddle of how they resulted in these present circumstances unfriendly planet. Together, they spent the following century creating and assembling a monster mothership that would convey 600,000 individuals to Hiigara, with neuroscientist Karan S'jet neurally wired into the ship as Fleet Command to supplant an unsustainably vast group. The amusement opens with the first journey of the mothership, testing the hyperspace drive which transports the armada to another goal. Rather than the help transport that was relied upon to be there, the mothership finds an antagonistic outsider armada. In the wake of vanquishing them, the mothership comes back to Kharak, to find that the planet has been annihilated by another outsider armada, and that just the 600,000 vagrants in suspended activity have endure. A caught adversary chief cases that the Kharak destruction was the result of their infringement of a 4,000-year-old settlement between the interstellar Taiidan Empire and the Kushan, which prohibits the last's from creating hyperspace innovation. 

Subsequent to pulverizing the leftovers of both outsider armadas, the early Kushan armada sets out for Hiigara, aim on recovering their antiquated homeworld. Their multi-arrange venture over the world takes them through space rock handle, a mammoth cloud, a ship memorial park and a few Taiidan stations. En route, they battle different relatives of their Hiigaran progenitors who have swung to robbery. They likewise meet the Bentusi, a race of merchants, who offer them trend setting innovation. In the wake of finding that the Bentusi have offered help to the outcasts, the Taiidan endeavor to devastate them, yet are ceased by the Kushan armada. The Bentusi at that point uncover that the Kushan had once administered their own realm, before being annihilated by the Taiidan and ousted from Hiigara. In appreciation for the Kushan's mediation, they guarantee to call the Galactic Council to consider the Kushan's case to Hiigara. 

As their adventure proceeds, the Kushan armada offers haven to the Taiidan rebel Captain Elson. With his assistance, they rally a disobedience to occupy the Taiidan armadas. He helps them in infiltrating the Hiigaran framework bar, and in drawing in the focal Taiidan armada driven by the Taiidan head. The sovereign figures out how to thump Karan into a trance like state for the span of the fight, yet the joined Kushan and dissident armadas rout the Taiidan in any case. The Galactic Council arrives presently and affirms the Kushan's case to Hiigara, a rich world rather than the desert planet of Kharak. At the point when the Kushan make landfall, Karan demands to be the last one to set foot on the planet. 

Relic Entertainment was established in Vancouver, Canada, on June 1, 1997, and started chip away at "Homeworld" as their first title. Relic prime supporters Alex Garden and Luke Moloney filled in as the executive and lead software engineer for the diversion, individually, while Erin Daly was the architect and Aaron Kambeitz the lead craftsman. Greenery enclosure was 22 years of age when he established the organization. Essayist David J. Williams is credited with the first story idea, while the content itself was composed by Martin Cirulis and the foundation legend was composed by creator Arinn Dembo. Cirulis and Dembo, acknowledged together as "Marcus Skyler", were chosen by the distributer, Sierra Studios, halfway through improvement to extend the story idea of Relic and Williams. Sierra consented to distribute the amusement right off the bat being developed dependent on, as per Garden, "two whiteboard introductions and no demo". The advancement of the amusement took more than two years; the diversion frameworks were to a great extent total by the last eight months, which Relic spent cleaning and improving the amusement, including the entire guide Sensors Manager see. The diversion was at first expected to be discharged toward the finish of 1998; Garden expressed in a 1999 meeting that the group discovered making the center amusement itself a lot simpler than getting it to the quality dimension they needed, and that on the off chance that they had realized how troublesome it would have been they may have decided not to do the task. A few thoughts for the diversion, including ship customization, escort courses, and distinctive unit types for the Kushan and Taidann armadas were cut amid improvement as they wasn't possible all around ok for the venture. 

Relic did not explicitly embarked to make a continuous methodology amusement; Garden and Relic were principally centered around making a diversion with energizing extensive scale space fights, and picked the class so as to help that. Therefore, they didn't attempt to make inventive ongoing interaction changes in the constant system sort, however rather chipped away at making actualizing the class in a completely 3D space to make the space fights they imagined. Greenery enclosure told "PC Games Magazine" in 1998 that "there's no kind of plan theory behind it. The way that it's constant methodology was right around a fluke." The first "Star Wars" film set of three was one of the diversions essential motivations, alongside the 1970s TV arrangement "Battlestar Galactica": in a 1998 meeting with "PC Zone", Garden expressed that his unique idea for the amusement was "a 3D amusement that seemed as though you were watching "Star Wars" however had a storyline like "Battlestar Galactica"". He drew further motivation from remedying what he felt were the constraints of the principal individual space flight amusement "". He felt that having the player control a ship from a cockpit see brought down the sentiment of the general fights, thus had the player control an entire armada from an outside view. 

The attention on the battle drove a few different zones of center for the advancement group: as per Garden, Relic spent significant exertion on making superb ship models, PC controlled flight strategies, and moves like immelmann turns since "everybody is going to zoom directly in on the primary fight, just to watch". They felt that the propelled unit-level moves with regards to extensive armada wide fights would expand drenching in the amusement for players, and make a ""Star Wars" feeling" to the fights. To complement this, rather than chronicle stock sound documents for units to utilize while moving, the group rather recorded a few thousand littler clasps which are consolidated to depict precisely which ships were making which move, and are then altered by the diversion's sound motor to mirror the position and movement of the boats in respect to the player's camera. The working title for the diversion was "Spaghetti Ball", picked for Garden's initial vision of the fights in the amusement as a mass of tangled flight ways as boats moved around one another, contained inside a bigger circle of accessible space. Albeit early reviews communicated worry about the troubles of controlling such a large number of boats in 3D space, as per Garden the group felt that moving the diversion's camera and controlling the armada were two completely separate activities, and by regarding them all things considered it made planning them and utilizing them a lot more straightforward. 

The sound structure, sound generation, and music sythesis for the diversion was contracted to arranger Paul Ruskay and Studio X Labs, which he established in February 1999 in the wake of beginning on "Homeworld" in October 1998. Notwithstanding his unique music creations, Ruskay utilized a chronicle of the 1936 piece for string symphony by Samuel Barber, "Adagio for Strings", in an early scene in the amusement when the player finds the decimation of Kharak. The piece, thusly, turned into a focal topic on the soundtrack. The end tune of the amusement, "Homeworld (The Ladder)", was authorized from English musical gang Yes. The soundtrack was discharged in a 13-track collection that was packaged with the Game of the Year Edition of "Homeworld" in May 2000, and again in a 37-track "Homeworld Remastered Original Soundtrack" advanced collection close by the "Homeworld Remastered Collection" in March 2015. 

"Homeworld" was exceptionally respected by commentators upon discharge; it is recorded by survey aggregator Metacritic as the most elevated appraised PC round of 1999, and the fourth-most elevated on any stage for the year. The illustrations were exceedingly lauded; Michael Ryan of GameSpot asserted it had "probably the most amazing designs ever", while Jason Levine of "PC Games Magazine" said that "no diversionâeverâhas made space itself resemble this". Eurogamer's audit lauded the "enormous, reckless and bright" foundations, which was resounded by Levine and John Keefer of GameSpy. Different analysts, for example, Vincent Lopez of IGN, likewise adulated the detail and assortment of the spaceships, and Jason Samuel of "GamePro" noticed that Relic had the capacity to utilize their designs motor to make the amusement's unpredictable cutscenes instead of depending on prerecorded recordings. Greg Fortune of "PC Gaming World" included that the rotatable camera was one of the "genuine delights of the diversion", enabling the player to see the activity from any edge or ship's perspective and "making a stunningly clearing realistic feel". The sound and music were additionally commended; Levine guaranteed the sound was "keeping pace with the designs", adulating how it changed when the player zoomed into or far from a fight, while Eurogamer and Lopez extolled the "environmental" soundtrack for making the state of mind of the diversion.

Reviewers lauded the full 3D nature of the amusement as lifting it from its generally standard continuous methodology interactivity frameworks; Levine said that the 3D was what made the amusement one of a kind, and Ryan expressly named the base ongoing interaction as "genuinely like any time tested constant procedure diversion" yet said that the 3D components and associated mission structure transformed it into an "alternate breed" of diversion. Fortune, be that as it may, concentrated rather on the trouble of the missions themselves, applauding the test and assortment of strategies expected to finish the amusement and praising it for having "the absolute best armada fights at any point found in a PC diversion". Levine, Ryan, Keefer, and Lopez all prominent the associated mission structure as an advancement in the class: by restricting the assets to assemble ships and pulling a similar armada through the missions, "Homeworld" changed over what might more often than not be a lot of separated missions into "sections" of a persistent amusement. They felt this associated the player to their armada as more than expendable units, and added a dimension of technique to the amusement. Keefer and Levine noted, be that as it may, this additional a lot of trouble to the amusement, particularly for progressively easygoing players, as the player could settle on choices in prior dimensions that rendered later ones hard to finish without an express trouble level to balance it. Ryan and Keefer additionally considered the 3D development confusing at first, however Levine and Samuel said the controls were "as simple as would be prudent". 

"Homeworld"s single-player plot got blended surveys; Lopez guaranteed it would keep players "riveted with consideration", Samuel summized it as a "radiant story", and Levine said that it was "the primary PC amusement to catch the glory and epic feel of the "Star Wars" films". The Eurogamer survey, in any case, thought of it as just "(generally) captivating", and Keefer said that "in spite of the fact that the story line is liquid and interesting", for every mission "the general topic is the equivalent: Kill the foe", while Ryan reprimanded the length for such a "small single-player diversion". The multiplayer ongoing interaction was lauded, particularly against human adversaries: Levine expressed that "multiplayer in "Homeworld" is a delight", while the Eurogamer survey considered it the amusement's most grounded part. The Eurogamer survey, alongside Samuel, additionally called the multiplayer mode more troublesome and drawing in than the single-player amusement.

"HardwareMAG" comparatively guaranteed the "progressive" and "earth shattering" status of the amusement in the constant system classification in 2004, as did "PC Gaming World" in 2003. 

"Homeworld" roused a progression of constant methodology amusements in a similar universe, starting in September 2000 when Sierra Studios discharged an independent extension by Barking Dog Studios, "". Occurring 15 years after the occasions of "Homeworld", the story fixates on Kiith Somtaawâa Hiigaran tribeâand its battles to shield Hiigara from a parasitic substance known as the Beast. A full spin-off, "Homeworld 2", was created by Relic Entertainment and discharged by Sierra in late 2003.

A fourth diversion in the arrangement, "", was created by Blackbird Interactive and distributed by Gearbox Software in 2016. A prequel to the arrangement, it is determined to the planet of Kharak rather than in space, and highlights a war between Kushan factions amid the revelation of the covered spaceship from "Homeworld".

Discharged carefully on February 25, 2015, for Windows PCs by Gearbox and on August 6, 2015, for macOS by Aspyr Media, the gathering incorporates the first and remastered adaptations of the two amusements. A retail version of the PC rendition of the amusement was discharged by Ubisoft on May 7, 2015. Notwithstanding similarity fixes for present day PCs, the "work of art" rendition of "Homeworld" expels nearby multiplayer and the authorized Yes melody; the "remastered" adaptation includes another amusement motor for the two diversions, and overhauled visuals, graphical impacts, models, and sound. It additionally at first expelled some usefulness not present in "Homeworld 2, for example, the fuel framework, ballistic shot demonstrating, and strategic ship arrangements; a portion of these were reestablished in a 2016 fix.
