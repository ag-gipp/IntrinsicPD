The Covenant proclaim mankind an attack against their divine beings and start crushing states by assaulting the planets with blasts of plasma, transforming their surfaces into glass. Regardless of endeavors to shield the Covenant from finding further human universes, a Covenant armada finds Earth amid "Radiance 2". 

"Coronas" are huge ringworlds, extending from thousands to countless kilometers in width, dissipated over the universe. These rings were built a great many years back by a race referred to as the Forerunners as weapons after all other options have run out against the parasitic outsider species known as the Flood. Whenever actuated, the Halos would demolish all conscious life in the cosmic system, denying the Flood of its nourishment. The Forerunners vanished after they initiated the rings. In "", while escaping the Covenant, the UNSC deliver "Mainstay of Autumn" discovered one of these ringworlds, Installation 04. The people figure out how to demolish the ring, ceasing the Flood; the Covenant, ignorant of the damaging idea of the rings, endeavor to flame another ring, Installation 05, amid "Radiance 2" so as to satisfy their religious prescience.

In "Corona 2", this pioneer of the Flood escapes from restriction on Installation 05, attacks the Covenant portable capital city of "High Charity", and catches Cortana, a human-made computerized reasoning. 

After the occasions of the comic tie-in "", the Master Chief crashes in eastern Africa, where he is found by Johnson and the Arbiter. The Chief and friends touch base at an UNSC station where Keyes and Lord Hood plan a last exertion to stop the Covenant head, the High Prophet of Truth, from initiating a Forerunner antiquity revealed outside the remains of the city of New Mombasa. The Chief clears hostile to air Covenant guards so Hood can lead the remainder of Earth's boats against the Prophet, yet Truth actuates the covered antique, making a slipspace entryway which he and his devotees enter. A Flood-invaded transport crash-lands close-by; Elite powers arrive and vitrify the Flood-contaminated zones of Earth, ceasing the risk. Following a message Cortana left on board the Flood transport, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes and their troops finish Truth the gateway.

If the amusement is finished at the Legendary trouble level, the scene keeps on demonstrating the bit of "Forward Unto Dawn" floating towards an obscure planet, uncovered in the continuation of be known as "Memorial", the essential setting of the crusade of "Radiance 4". 

"Radiance 3" was at first considered before "Corona 2" was discharged in 2004. A significant part of the staff were engrossed in making additional substance for "Radiance 2", while others proceeded with the foundation for the improvement of "Corona 3". Bungie stayed tranquil with respect to what their new undertaking was, leaving remarks in their week after week update suggesting "another venture". The diversion was formally declared with a continuous realistic trailer at E3 2006. 

Bungie kept the open educated on diversion improvement through week after week reports on their site. Amid advancement, the diversion was isolated into single player and multiplayer assembles; this made investigating and testing the a lot littler multiplayer documents speedier. While subtleties of "Corona 3"s multiplayer were broadly scattered in the sixteen months paving the way to the discharge, the single-player part of the storyline was kept moderately mystery all through a significant part of the advancement to develop intrigue. The principal battle screen captures did not show up until a year after the declaration trailer, on July 5, 2007, as a "bother" for the arranged pace of showcasing. 

An open beta trial of the amusement's online multiplayer highlights, just as spared movies and record share, occurred four months before the full discharge. Players required a "Crackdown" circle to play the beta.

Players can see separations of up to away, all completely three-dimensional. Constant reflections were composed into the motor; in any case, they are regularly unused as Bungie thought of it as a misuse of assets. 

"Corona 3" does not locally render at genuine HD goals (somewhere around 720 lines of vertical goals). In a Bungie Weekly Update, it was affirmed that the diversion renders at 1152Ã640 goals rather than the standard 1280Ã720 (HD) goals that most Xbox 360 recreations use.

Months before the arrival of "Radiance 3", the amusement's last trying duplicate before its gold dischargeâcodenamed Epsilon and affirmed by Bungie to be practically finishedâwas spilled to the Internet. Microsoft responded to this hole by having the Xbox Live records of gamers found playing the Epsilon duplicate restricted until the year 9999.

PepsiCo declared another line of soda, a variation of Mountain Dew named Game Fuel, marked with the "Radiance 3" logo and the Master Chief. A great part of the publicizing concentrated on engaging the overall population, instead of simply no-nonsense aficionados of the amusement; for instance, some 7-Eleven stores promoted "Corona 3" and sold claim to fame mugs and duplicates of the diversion. 

"Radiance 3" was discharged in three separate retail forms, marked as "Standard", "Restricted" and "Amazing" versions.

Goldstein was exceptionally condemning of the eighth dimension, expressing "the penultimate section is so terrible, simply contemplating it puts a spoiled preference for my mouth."

Goldstein and Steve West of Cinema Blend thought a piece of the diversion's story was lost by not having the Arbiter including as unmistakably as the character was in "Corona 2". 

Most productions concurred that multiplayer was by a long shot a standout amongst the best highlights; IGN said that the multiplayer map lineup was the most grounded of the arrangement, and GameSpy included that "each [multiplayer] map is amazingly all around tuned". The Forge level editorial manager and spared films highlights were singled out as especially solid highlights, notwithstanding eminent voice acting and Martin O'Donnell's rich score. 

Different objections concentrated on the computerized reasoning; pundits commended the adversary AI yet whined that the insight of the player's partners was far more unfortunate. Bryan Vore of "Amusement Informer" said that human appearances and a few surfaces were simply "humiliating".

"Promoting Age" announced that motion picture studio officials were persuaded the arrival of "Corona 3" hurt film industry receipts; the week's take was 27% not exactly the earlier year's yield. While a few administrators chose the difference in assessed and real gross for movies like "The Heartbreak Kid" was expected more to the film's poor gathering, different examiners trusted that "the crowd on ["Halo 3"] is the 18-to-34 statistic, like what you'd find in films" and that this prompted a diminishing in receipts.
