He played for the Montreal Canadiens from 1953 to 1963; amid his residency, the group won the Stanley Cup multiple times, including five sequential successes. In 2017 Plante was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' ever. 

Plante resigned in 1965 however was induced to come back to the National Hockey League to play for the extension St. Louis Blues in 1968. He was later exchanged to the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1970 and to the Boston Bruins in 1973. He joined the World Hockey Association as mentor and general director for the Quebec Nordiques in 1973â 74. He at that point played objective for the Edmonton Oilers in 1974â 75, finishing his expert vocation with that group. 

Plante was the first NHL goaltender to wear a goaltender cover in guideline play on a standard and tried numerous renditions of the veil (counting the trailblazer of the present veil/protective cap mix) with the help of different specialists. Plante was the first NHL goaltender to routinely play the puck outside his wrinkle in help of his group's defencemen, and he frequently educated his colleagues from behind the play. Plante was enlisted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1978, was picked as the goaltender of the Canadiens' "fantasy group" in 1985, and was drafted into the Quebec Sports Pantheon in 1994. The Montreal Canadiens resigned Plante's pullover, #1, the next year. Plante positions seventh among NHL goalies forever profession wins with 437. 

Plante was one of the main goaltenders to skate behind the net to stop the puck. He additionally was one of the first to raise his arm on an icing call to let his defencemen realize what was occurring. He idealized an exceptional, positional style, chopping down the points; he wound up one of the principal goaltenders to compose a how-to book about the position. He was a pioneer of stickhandling the puck; before that time, goaltenders inactively remained in the net and basically redirected pucks to defencemen or backchecking advances. 

Plante was enlisted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1978, and into the Quebec Sports Pantheon in 1994. His pullover, #1, was resigned in 1995 by the Montreal Canadiens. The Jacques Plante Memorial Trophy was set up in his respect as an honor to the top goaltender in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. The Jacques Plante Trophy was set up in Switzerland after Plante's passing; it is given out yearly to the top Swiss goaltender. The fundamental field in Shawinigan, the town he experienced childhood in, was renamed to ArÃ©na Jacques Plante. 

Plante was chosen by "Sports Illustrated" magazine to its 1991 record-breaking All-Star group. 

His damage and ensuing wearing of a cover was portrayed in a portion of Canada's "Legacy Minute" arrangement. 

Plante was conceived on a ranch close Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel, in Mauricie, Quebec, the first of 11 youngsters destined to Palma and Xavier Plante. The family moved to Shawinigan Falls, where his dad worked in one of the neighborhood manufacturing plants. In 1932, Plante started to play hockey, skateless and with a tennis ball, utilizing a goaltender's hockey stick his dad had cut from a tree root. When he was five years of age, Plante tumbled off a stepping stool and broke his hand. The crack neglected to recuperate legitimately and influenced his playing style amid his initial hockey profession; he experienced effective remedial medical procedure as a grown-up. Plante experienced asthma beginning in early adolescence. This kept him from skating for stretched out periods so he inclined toward playing goaltender. As his playing advanced, Jacques got his first guideline goaltender's stick for Christmas of 1936. His dad made Plante's first cushions by stuffing potato sacks and strengthening them with wooden boards. As a kid, Plante played hockey outside in the sharply chilly Quebec winters. His mom showed him how to sew his very own tuques to shield him from the virus. Plante kept sewing and weaving for an amazing duration and wore his hand-sewed tuques while playing and rehearsing until entering the National Hockey League (NHL). 

Plante's first invasion into sorted out hockey came at age 12. He was watching his school's group practice, when the mentor requested the goaltender off the ice after a warmed contention over his play, and Plante requested to supplant him. The mentor allowed him to play since there was no other accessible goaltender; it was rapidly clear that Plante could stand his ground, regardless of different players being numerous years more seasoned than he was. He awed the mentor and remained on as the group's main goaltender. 

After two years, Plante was playing for five unique groups â the nearby manufacturing plant group, and groups in the dwarf, adolescent, junior and middle classes. Plante requested a pay from the processing plant group's mentor after his dad revealed to him that different players were being paid in light of the fact that they were organization workers. The mentor paid Plante 50Â cents per amusement to hold him and keep up the group's ubiquity. Thereafter, Plante started to get different ideas from different groups; he was offered $80 every weekâan extensive whole back thenâto play for a group in England, and a comparative idea to play for the Providence Reds of the American Hockey League. Plante left them behind in light of the fact that his folks needed him to complete secondary school. He graduated with top distinctions in 1947. Upon graduation, he accepted a position as a representative in a Shawinigan processing plant. Half a month later, the Quebec Citadels offered Plante $85 every week to play for them; he acknowledged, denoting the start of his expert vocation. 

His epithet was "Jake the Snake". 

Jacques joined the Quebec Citadelles in 1947. While playing for Quebec, Plante began to play the puck outside his wrinkle, a strategy he created when he perceived that the group's resistance was performing inadequately. Fans observed Plante's capricious playing style to energize, however it maddened his supervisors, who trusted that a goaltender should remain in net and let his players recuperate the puck. Plante had arrived at the resolution that as long as he was responsible for the puck, the rivals couldn't shoot it at him â this is presently standard practice for goaltenders. A similar season, the Citadelles beat the Montreal Junior Canadiens in the group finals, with Plante being named most profitable player in his group. The Montreal Canadiens' general chief, Frank J. Selke, ended up keen on obtaining Plante as an individual from the group. In 1948, Plante got a solicitation to the Canadiens' preparation camp. On August 17, 1949, Selke offered Plante an agreement. Plante played for Montreal's subsidiary Royal Montreal Hockey Club, winning $4,500 for the season, and an additional $500 for rehearsing with the Canadiens. 

In 1949, he wedded Jacqueline GagnÃ©; they had two children, Michel and Richard. 

In January 1953, Plante was called up to play for the Canadiens. Bill Durnan, the goaltender who played for Montreal when Plante initially started, had resigned, and Gerry McNeil, their top goaltender, had broken his jaw. Plante played three recreations, yet in that brief span, he produced debate. Mentor Dick Irvin, Sr. did not wish his players to emerge by any expansion to their ordinary regalia. Plante dependably wore one of his tuques while playing hockey, and after a contention with Irvin, the majority of Plante's tuques had disappeared from the Montreal storage space. Indeed, even without his lucky trinket, Plante surrendered just four objectives in the three recreations he played, every one of them wins. 

Later amid the 1952â 53 NHL season, Plante played in the playoffs against the Chicago Black Hawks. He won his first playoff diversion with a shutout. Montreal won that arrangement and inevitably the Stanley Cup, and Plante's name was engraved on the Cup out of the blue. 

Toward the start of 1953, McNeil was as yet the beginning goaltender for the Canadiens. Selke doled out Plante to the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League so fans in the United States would become acquainted with him. Plante was in a split second effective; Fred Hunt, the general director of the Bisons, told Kenny Reardon, Montreal's selecting supervisor, "he's <nowiki>[Plante]</nowiki> the greatest fascination since past times worth remembering of Terry Sawchuk." 

Before the finish of the 1953â 54 season, Plante was all around dug in inside the NHL. In the spring of 1954, he experienced medical procedure to address his left hand, which he had broken in his adolescence. He couldn't move the hand all around ok to get high shots and repaid by utilizing the remainder of his body. The task was effective. 

On February 12, 1954, Plante was called up to the Canadiens and built up himself as their beginning goaltender â he didn't come back to the small time for a long time. Plante was the Canadiens' main goaltender toward the start of the 1954â 55 NHL season. On March 13, 1955, with just four recreations left in the season, an on-ice fight brought about the suspension of Montreal's driving scorer, Maurice Richard, for the remainder of the period and the playoffs. Four evenings later, playing in Montreal before a furious group, Plante was observer to the uproar that pursued. The Canadiens in this manner lost to the Detroit Red Wings in the finals. 

For the 1955â 56 season, Plante was the unchallenged beginning goaltender of the Canadiens; Gerry McNeil had not played the past season and was sent to the Montreal Royals. Charlie Hodge, Plante's reinforcement the past season, was sent to the Seattle Americans, a Canadiens' ranch group. Later that season, Montreal won the Stanley Cup, the first of what might be five back to back Stanley Cup title seasons. The following season, Plante missed the majority of November in view of endless bronchitis, an outcome of the asthma that had influenced him since adolescence. Amid the 1957â 58 NHL season, the Canadiens won their third straight Stanley Cup regardless of wounds to Plante and different individuals from the group. Plante's asthma was deteriorating. He supported a blackout with only half a month left in the season and missed three rounds of the playoffs. In the 6th round of the Stanley Cup finals, Plante's asthma was making him discombobulated, and he was experiencing issues concentrating; he crumbled toward the finish of the amusement after partner Doug Harvey scored the arrangement winning objective. The Canadiens proceeded to win the Stanley Cup again at the end of the 1958â 59 season. 

Amid the 1959-60 season, Plante wore a goaltender cover without precedent for an ordinary season diversion. In spite of the fact that Plante had utilized his cover practically speaking since 1956 in the wake of missing 13 amusements as a result of a sinusitis task, head mentor Toe Blake was apprehensive it would disable his vision and would not allow him to wear it amid guideline play. Be that as it may, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot discharged by Andy Bathgate three minutes into a diversion against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the changing area for join. When he returned, he was wearing the rough home-made goaltender cover that he had been utilizing in practices. Blake was outraged, yet he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante would not come back to the objective except if he wore the veil. Blake conceded to the condition that Plante dispose of the veil when the cut mended. The Canadiens won 3â 1. Amid the next days Plante would not dispose of the cover, and as the Canadiens kept on winning, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak extended to 18 diversions. Plante did not wear the cover, at Blake's solicitation, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3â 0, and the veil returned for good the following night. That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last. 

Plante therefore planned his very own and other goaltenders' veils. He was not the first NHL goaltender known to wear a face veil. Montreal Maroons' Clint Benedict wore a rough calfskin form in 1930 to secure a broken nose, however Plante presented the veil as ordinary gear, and it is currently obligatory hardware for goaltenders. 

Hampered by awful agony in his left knee amid the 1960â 61 NHL season, Plante was sent down to the small time Montreal Royals. Torn ligament was found in his knee, and the knee was carefully fixed amid the mid year of 1961. The following season Plante turned out to be just the fourth goaltender to win the Hart Memorial Trophy â he additionally won the Vezina Trophy for the 6th time. The 1962â 63 season was agitating for Plante. His asthma had compounded, and he missed the greater part of the early season. His association with his mentor, Toe Blake, kept on falling apart in view of Plante's steady medical issues. Afterward, Plante was at the focal point of a noteworthy contention when he asserted that net sizes in the NHL were not uniform, in this way giving a measurable favorable position to goaltenders playing for the Chicago Black Hawks, Boston Bruins, and New York Rangers. His case was later affirmed as the consequence of an assembling blunder. 

After the Canadiens were dispensed with for the third straight year in the primary playoff round amid the spring of 1963, there was mounting weight for change from their fans and media. Developing strain among Plante and Blake in light of Plante's conflicting hard working attitude and disposition made Blake announce that for the 1963â 64 season it is possible that he or Plante must go. On June 4, 1963, Plante was exchanged to the New York Rangers, with Phil Goyette and Don Marshall in return for Gump Worsley, Dave Balon, Leon Rochefort, and Len Ronson. Plante played for the Rangers for one full season and part of a second. He resigned in 1965 while playing for the Rangers' AHL associate, the Baltimore Clippers. His better half was sick at the time, and he required medical procedure on his correct knee. 

Upon retirement, Plante accepted a position with Molson as a business delegate yet stayed dynamic in the NHL. In 1965, Scotty Bowman approached Plante to play for the Montreal Jr. Canadiens in a diversion against the Soviet National Team. Respected to speak to his nation, Plante concurred, and in the wake of getting consent from both the Rangers (who possessed his rights) and Molson, he started rehearsing. The Canadiens won 2â 1, and Plante was named first star of the amusement. 

Toward the start of the 1967â 68 NHL season, Plante got a call from his ex-partner Bert Olmstead looking for some assistance training the development Oakland Seals. Plante instructed principally by model, and after the three-week preparing camp he returned home to Montreal. Plante additionally played a presentation amusement with the Seals. Gossipy tidbits twirled that Plante was arranging a rebound. 

In June 1968, Plante was drafted by the St. Louis Blues and marked for $35,000 for the 1968â 69 season. In his first season with the Blues, Plante split the goaltending obligations with Glenn Hall. He won the Vezina Trophy that season for the seventh time, outperforming Bill Durnan's record. While playing for the Blues in the 1969â 70 playoffs against the Boston Bruins, a shot discharged by Fred Stanfield and diverted by Phil Esposito hit Plante in the temple, thumping him out and breaking his fiberglass veil. The main thing Plante said after he recovered cognizance at the medical clinic was that the cover spared his life. That amusement turned out to be his keep going for the Blues, and he was exchanged the mid year of 1970 to the Toronto Maple Leafs. He drove the NHL with the most reduced objectives against normal (GAA) amid his first season with the Maple Leafs. At season's end, he was named to the NHL's second All-Star group, his seventh such respect. He kept on playing for the Leafs until he was exchanged to the Boston Bruins late in the 1972â 73 season, recording a shutout against the Black Hawks in his presentation for the Bruins.

Plante acknowledged a $10Â million, 10-year contract to move toward becoming mentor and general supervisor of the Quebec Nordiques of the World Hockey Association in 1973. He was exceedingly disappointed with his and the group's execution and surrendered toward the finish of the 1973â 74 season. Leaving retirement yet again, Plante played 31 diversions for the Edmonton Oilers of the WHA in the 1974â 75 season. Plante resigned amid the Oilers' preparation camp in 1975â 76 in the wake of getting news that his most youthful child had passed on. 

Plante had a very much earned notoriety for his capacity to examine the sport of hockey.

He kept broad notes on contradicting players and groups all through his vocation. He made his introduction in the telecom stall amid his first retirement during the 1960s as a shading pundit for communicates of Quebec Junior League recreations close by Danny Gallivan of Hockey Night in Canada acclaim. Radio Canada, the French language part of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, brought Plante on board as on-air examiner for its transmissions of the 1972 Summit Series between the national group of the Soviet Union and a Canadian group made up of expert players from the NHL. Plante was one of only a handful couple of North American experts who contradicted from the broadly held faith in the prevalence of the Canadian group. 

Plante likewise composed widely on hockey. He composed hockey segments beginning from the get-go in his vocation and was distributed in "La Voix de Shawinigan", "Le Samedi", and "Game Magazine." He estranged nearby correspondents by composing a section for the neighborhood paper amid his time as mentor of the Quebec Nordiques. His original work, "Goaltending", was distributed in 1972 in English, with the French version (entitled "Devant le filet") distributed in 1973. In his book, Plante sketched out a program of goaltender improvement that included off-ice works out, decision of hardware, styles of play, and diversion day arrangement. He likewise prompted on best instructing strategies for both youthful and propelled goaltenders. His book stayed well known with mentors and players and was republished in both French and English in 1997, 25Â years after it was first distributed. 

Beginning in 1967, Plante was one of the educators at "Ãcole moderne de hockey," a mid year hockey school for youthful players.
