Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories 

"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories" is the second amusement in the "Kingdom Hearts" arrangement. It is an immediate spin-off of "Kingdom Hearts", and its completion is set about a year prior to "Kingdom Hearts II". The amusement pursues Sora and companions, investigating a baffling palace. There, Riku investigates the cellar levels and battles the dimness. The diversion presents new characters and plotlines that further extend the "Kingdom Hearts" universe and set up the reason for "Kingdom Hearts II". 

In spite of the fact that not as fruitful as the other "Kingdom Hearts" amusements, it got positive audits and sold well. It was commended for its story, illustrations, and FMVs. The amusement includes another card-based fight framework that is a takeoff from its ancestor. When it appeared in Japan, it sold 104,000 units in 48 hours. 

"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories" is a mix between a pretending computer game and collectible card amusement. The principle pretending viewpoint is an encounter point framework that is utilized to expand the character's greatest wellbeing or Card Points, or to gain proficiency with another aptitude. The cards are used in the movement of the story just as in battle. The diversion includes a field guide and fight screen. The field map is an isometric region where the player can cross between rooms. Foes occupy the field guide and track the player to take part in battle, which can be started through contact between the player and a foe. When battle has been locked in, the amusement changes to the fight screen which uses a card-based fight framework. 

An exceptional perspective to this diversion is "room union": to progress through the amusement, the player must use Map cards got subsequent to winning fights to blend rooms. The properties of each roomâincluding nature of things and quality of enemiesâare controlled by the Map cards that the player picks. Each card has a particular impact: red cards influence the number and sort of foes; green cards influence the intensity of the player's deck; and blue cards influence the properties of the room itself, for example, permitting money boxes or a spare point to show up. 

The amusement highlights three methods of ongoing interaction. The initial two are story modes that highlight either Sora or Riku, and the third is a two player fight mode. At first just Sora's story mode is accessible; when finished, "Switch/Rebirth" mode winds up accessible. Turn around/Rebirth enables the player to play a second story mode including Riku and a connection mode where players can fight each other by means of a Game Link Cable. 

Battle utilizes a card-based fight framework executed continuously. The player can hop and move around the fight screen as they would on the field map, however all physical assaults, enchantment, things and summonings are enacted by playing a game of cards. Cards are positioned from zero to nine, and are utilized for making assault combos or breaking foe cards. Except for zero-positioned cards which are increasingly costly regarding Card Points (CP) contrasted with different cards of a similar sort and have different positions, more CP are required to put higher-positioned cards in the player's deck. Card Pointsâexpanded through dimension upâlimit the quantity of cards the player can use in a deck. Cards with rank "zero" can break any restricting card or combo whenever played after the contradicting card or combo, however they can be broken by any card or combo too on the off chance that it is played after the zero card is played. Breaking a restricting card will drop that assault and stagger the washout of a card break for a brief span. Unique adversary cards might be acquired by crushing adversaries and managers, and are utilized to give the player an impermanent capacity, going from improved hostile and protective abilities to adjusting the qualities of specific cards. 

Joining cards in sets of three will make combo assaults that are generally progressively hard to break in light of the fact that the position of the combo will be the entirety of the positions of the three cards in the combo. Certain card blends will make a "skill", a unique mix that will make an amazing physical assault, supernatural spell, or bring assault. At the point when the player comes up short on cards, the deck must be reloaded. Moreover, utilizing a card mix will make the primary card in the combo become unusable until the finish of battle. 

Sora's and Riku's accounts vary interactivity insightful in a few different ways. In Sora's story, Sora acquires cards by overcoming foes or through Moogle Shops. Sometimes, Sora must gain the particular card first through a plot occasion before it ends up accessible. Sora can make and store three distinct decks in the interruption menu. Dissimilar to Sora, Riku has a shut deck that can't be tweaked. The cards in his deck change contingent upon the world in which he is voyaging. Riku is constrained to essentially physical assaults, adversary cards and Mickey Mouse partner cards. He can enact "dim mode" and open his skill assaults in the event that he gathers enough "dull focuses". Dull focuses are earned by breaking foe cards and combos, and the contrast between Riku's card or combo and the adversary's card or combo is what number of dim focuses he will gather for that card break. 

"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories" is set following the occasions of the primary diversion. It is set in Castle Oblivion, a baffling chÃ¢teau kept by Lord Marluxia. Sora and his colleagues are informed that the chÃ¢teau makes guests lose their recollections after entering. The anteroom and territories between floors are white with bloom themed enhancements, yet each floor can be changed into an alternate world from the principal "Kingdom Hearts" amusement utilizing "world cards" made from Sora's recollections. Like previously, a large number of the universes of Disney and Square Enix return. 

In contrast to the past diversion, the universes are made from Sora's recollections. Accordingly, a large number of the occasions experienced in "Kingdom Hearts" are remembered in this amusement, Sora experiences memory-based adaptations of Disney characters that he has met previously (aside from Deep Jungle in "Tarzan"). The individual plotlines contrast from those in the first amusement and spin around the topic of memory. Similarly as "Kingdom Hearts" had a few universes made explicitly for that amusement, "Chain of Memories" presents Twilight Town as a world made from recollections on "the opposite side of Sora's heart", notwithstanding the first universes of "Kingdom Hearts". 

Sora returns as the amusement's hero. Donald Duck and Goofy are less associated with the interactivity and story. Like the primary amusement, "Chain of Memories" includes various characters from both the "Last Fantasy" arrangement and the Disney energized highlights standard. Being an immediate continuation, a significant number of the characters from the main "Kingdom Hearts" return in this diversion.

Six individuals from the Organization fill in as rivals; four show up in Sora's story mode, and the other two in Riku's. Among the four Sora experiences are Marluxia, the master of Castle Oblivion; Larxene, Marluxia's colleague; Axel, a twofold specialist with shrouded unwaveringness; and Vexen, Marluxia's reluctant associate. Then again, Riku fights Zexion and Lexaeus, Vexen's partners. Ansem additionally shows up in Riku's story as a substance that endeavors to control Riku. A significant number of the Disney lowlifess return by means of memory-based entertainments like the remainder of the Disney characters. 

Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket stroll down a twisting way looking for Riku and King Mickey. A man wearing a dark, hooded coat shows up and coordinates Sora towards a huge fortification called Castle Oblivion. After entering, the voyagers understand that they have overlooked the majority of their capacities. The hooded man clarifies that the more profound they go into the stronghold, the more recollections they will lose, however they will likewise reveal new recollections all the while. He makes a deck of cards produced using Sora's and his companions' recollections, and discloses to them that all that they experience in this manor will be founded on their recollections. 

Sora rises the mansion, going head to head against other hooded figures who structure a gathering called "the Organization" en route. As Sora loses his recollections, he step by step seems to recall a young lady named NaminÃ© as an old companion of his, and gains from Organization part Larxene that she is being held detainee in the palace. He likewise conflicts with an imitation of Riku made and constrained by another Organization part, Vexen, and accepted by both Sora and the copy himself to be the genuine Riku. Axel, an Organization twofold operator, discharges NaminÃ© and enables her to meet Sora face to face. Sora finds NaminÃ© to be the one controlling his recollections, having been compelled to do as such by Marluxia, the ruler of Castle Oblivion and the figure who tricked Sora there, as a feature of his arrangement to topple the remainder of the Organization with Larxene. Sora trips to the most elevated floor and thrashings Marluxia, after which NaminÃ© puts Sora and his companions into unit like machines to enable them to recapture the recollections they have lost, despite the fact that they will overlook the occasions that unfolded in the chÃ¢teau. Before they are put to rest, Sora and NaminÃ© guarantee to meet again as genuine companions once he stirs, Sora solidly trusting that his recollections of her and the palace will stay in his heart notwithstanding being overlooked. 

In "Invert/Rebirth", which happens consistently with the amusement's fundamental story, Riku is transported from the domain of dimness to Castle Oblivion's most profound storm cellar, and he battles illusions of past adversaries to battle his internal obscurity as he climbs upwards. Vexen battles Riku to get his information and makes his copy to counter Marluxia's arrangement. Ansem, as yet having Riku's body, attempts to recapture control of Riku, yet Mickey's capacity keeps Ansem under control. In transit, Riku fights and thrashings Lexaeus, an individual from Vexen's hover, just to be hauled into the domain of murkiness. Be that as it may, he is spared by Mickey when Ansem almost prevails with regards to accepting Riku's body as his own. With Marluxia dispensed with at this point, another of Vexen's partners, Zexion, endeavors to discard Riku by suffocating him in light. Riku is spared by NaminÃ© camouflaged as Kairi, who encourages him to control his haziness, enabling him to crush Zexion. Riku later meets DiZ, a perplexing individual inspired by Riku who sends him to discover NaminÃ©. Riku's imitation, who has since educated of his adjusted recollections, looks to legitimize his reality by slaughtering Riku, just to be demolished by him. Riku faces Ansem after gaining from NaminÃ© that Ansem lives in his heart, and thrashings him after DiZ gathers him for Riku to battle. Riku then sets out on a voyage to use the two his dimness and his light with Mickey as his friend. 

The thought for a mediator title was created after executive Tetsuya Nomura and his group had just started to create thoughts for the second "Kingdom Hearts" diversion, which he had proposed to be set a year after the first. Initially titled "Kingdom Hearts: Lost Memories", Nomura changed the name to coordinate the general layout of the story, while as yet mirroring the topic of recollections. "Chain of Memories" was created to conquer any hindrance between "Kingdom Hearts" and "Kingdom Hearts II". Like most spin-offs, "Kingdom Hearts II" was intended to have the character begin from the earliest starting point, capacity astute. To clarify the loss of capacities picked up in the past diversion, Nomura had the story rotate around Sora's recollections getting tainted and executed the card fight framework to symbolize Sora's different recollections. 

Nomura was reluctant about discharging a "Kingdom Hearts" title on the Game Boy Advance, feeling that the 3D illustrations of the first amusement would not make an interpretation of well into 2D.

Since the music is reused from the first, a "Chain of Memories" soundtrack was never discharged.
