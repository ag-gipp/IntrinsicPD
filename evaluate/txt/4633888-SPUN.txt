Altgens captured President Kennedy for the AP in 1961 at Perrin Air Force Base. Kennedy and his ancestor Dwight D. Eisenhower were making a trip to Bonham, Texas, in November to go to the burial service of Sam Rayburn, three-time Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Prior that day, Altgens was the main photojournalist to move to the 29th floor of the Mercantile National Bank Building in Dallas to cover the salvage of a young lady from a lift fire. 

On November 22, 1963, Altgens was booked to work in the AP workplaces in Dallas as the wirephoto proofreader. He asked rather to go to the "triple bridge" (the railroad connect under which Elm, Main and Commerce Streets meet at the west end of Dealey Plaza) to photo the motorcade that was to take President Kennedy from Love Field to his planned appearance at the Dallas Trade Mart. Altgens was not allocated to work in the field that day, so he took his own single-focal point reflex camera instead of the engine driven hardware regularly utilized for news occasions. 

Altgens endeavored to locate a decent camera edge on the scaffold, however formally dressed police said it was private property and dismissed him, and he moved to an area inside the square. He started capturing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles moved toward Houston Street, and got a nearby of the presidential limousine as it went right onto Houston. He at that point got his hardware sack and kept running on the grass toward the south check along Elm Street, preventing opposite the Plaza's north corridor. Altgens heard a noisy clamor at about a similar time as his first photo from that spot (concurrent to Zapruder film outline 255), however he didn't review having any response since he thought the commotion originated from a sparkler. 

As Altgens set up for a second photo along Elm Street, he heard a sound that he perceived as gunfire, and saw that the President had been struck in the head. Altgens later composed that his camera was engaged and prepared, "yet when JFK's head detonated, sending substance toward me, I basically progressed toward becoming paralyzed.Â ... However, numerous news individuals state I ought to have snapped the photo anywayÂ ... I ought to have made the image that I was set up to make. What's more, I didn't do it." 

Altgens recouped, and his next photo demonstrated the First Lady with her hand on the vehicle's trunk cover and Secret Service operator Clint Hill remaining on the guard behind her as the driver had quickened. This photo was immediately repeated on the front pages of papers far and wide. Mrs. Kennedy affirmed the next June that she knew about the picture, yet had no memory of her activities.

After the shots finished, Altgens saw a few furnished men running up the green slant between Elm Street and the railroad tracks; he crossed the road toward the action to check whether he could get an image of anybody being captured. When they returned without a suspect, Altgens rushed back to the AP wirephoto office in the "Dallas Morning News" expanding on Houston Street to document his report and have the film created. He called the news office, prompting one of the principal news releases of the shooting: 

When his photos had been disseminated by means of the wirephoto arrange, Altgens was sent to Parkland Memorial Hospital alongside a second picture taker. Both remained at Parkland until Kennedy's body was taken to Air Force One, still at Love Field. 

Altgens came back to Dealey Plaza to photo the death site for charting purposes, at that point was sent to Dallas City Hall to recover crafted by another AP picture taker who had pictures of denounced professional killer Lee Harvey Oswald in guardianship. This was the main time he saw the suspect, and Altgens thought Oswald hinted at having been completely grilled. 

Ten days after Kennedy was killed, the Associated Press in Dallas revealed that Altgens' first photo along Elm Street had caught the consideration of individuals who saw that one of the men remaining in the primary entryway to the book safe seemed to look like the charged executioner Lee Harvey Oswald. Those spectators brought up the issue of whether Oswald could have slaughtered Kennedy, saying he would not have had the capacity to get to the entryway from the 6th floor of the structure. The report cited vault administrator Roy Truly, who said the man in the picture was not Oswald but rather an alternate representative, Billy Nolan Lovelady. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the AP they had just explored the photo and furthermore recognized Lovelady. 

On May 24, 1964, six months after the shooting, the "New York Herald Tribune" revealed that Altgensâthe man in charge of "presumably the most dubious photo of the decade", and one of only a handful couple of individuals remaining close to the motorcade when Kennedy was shotâhad not been addressed either by the FBI or by the Warren Commission.

FBI specialists talked with Altgens eight days after the fact, on June 2, 1964; he affirmed before the Warren Commission on July 22. At this point, Altgens knew about the person who took after Oswald; Lovelady had been met for the "Envoy Tribune" article, and Altgens affirmed that he also had been reached.

He later composed that others were opposing any such acknowledgment. 

Altgens was included in two AP dispatches issued on November 22, 1963. He at first revealed hearing two shots, yet thought somebody had been setting off firecrackers. For a November 25 story, Altgens composed that he didn't know the starting point of the shots until some other time, yet he trusted they originated from the opposite side of Elm Street, inverse the presidential limousine from where he was standing. 

In 1964, Altgens affirmed for the Warren Commission and was gotten some information about the gunfire and whether he knew its source.

Altgens trusted Kennedy's injuries recommended a last shot that originated from the region of the book store building, yet he couldn't state with any assurance. 

At the point when CBS TV talked with him in 1967, Altgens said it was clear to him that the head shot originated from behind Kennedy's limousine "since it made him jolt forward, dislodging him from this wretchedness in the seat pad". He included that the uproar over the road after the shooting struck him as odd, since he trusted the professional killer would have expected to move all around rapidly to arrive.

A check for US$300 was sent to cover the airfare, yet Altgens did not have any desire to go; he thought Garrison was keeping his best interests in mind. 

Altgens and previous Texas Governor John Connally met by chance in Houston a brief span later. Connally disclosed to Altgens that he additionally had been called to affirm and got airfare, yet he chose to money the check and spend the cash. Connally squeezed Altgens to spend his too. Altgens later discovered that they were not required to visit.

Altgens portrayed what he saw following the lethal shot to JFK. "There was no blood on the right-hand side of his face; there was no blood on the facade of his face. However, there was an enormous measure of blood on the left-hand side and at the back of the head." This proposed to Altgens that the shots originated from the back, in light of the fact that he ought to have seen some proof generally. He likewise observed Jackie Kennedy on the storage compartment of the limousine, and feeling that she was terrified by the occasions and was attempting to escape. 

No More Silence

The couple had moved a few times, however they were all the while being pestered by individuals who needed the shirt Lovelady was wearing when Kennedy was shot.
