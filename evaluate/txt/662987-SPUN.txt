Artist Peter Gabriel loaned his voice and a melody to the diversion's sound; the first score was composed by "Exile"s writer Jack Wall. Generally, gathering to the diversion was certain; commentators praised the great visuals, sound, and riddles. Distributions, for example, "PC Gaming World" disagreed with the control plan of the diversion. "Disclosure" is the last amusement in the "Myst" arrangement to utilize both prerendered foundations and full-movement video; the last diversion in the arrangement, "", is rendered continuously all through. 

"Myst IV: Revelation" is an undertaking diversion in which the player encounters ongoing interaction from the eyes of an anonymous hero alluded to as the Stranger. Players investigate intuitive universes known as Ages by utilizing the mouse or console, tackling riddles and revealing the amusement's story. Players can't move uninhibitedly over each Age; rather, as in the past recreations in the "Myst" arrangement, they travel by clicking set areas called "hubs", where players can pivot their view toward any path.

Players can utilize an on-screen diary to write down notes as opposed to recording signs likewise with past "Myst" amusements. A great part of the amusement's story is uncovered by means of flashbacks activated by an ornament that has the ability to hand-off recollections appended to objects. Zip mode, the special necklace, the camera, and the diary are accessible through a menu on the base of the amusement screen. 

In 1825 Atrus calls the Stranger to his home in Tomahna to demand his companion's help. Atrus is the essayist of extraordinary books, which fill in as connections to universes known as Ages. Twenty years sooner, his two children, Sirrus and Achenar, crushed his library on Myst and caught their folks so as to loot the abundance of Atrus' Ages. The Stranger's intercession spared Atrus, who had detained his children by means of snares proposed for hoodlums. Atrus' better half Catherine trusts that, following twenty years, they have at long last atoned for their wrongdoings. Atrus isn't as certain his children have improved, thus wishes the Stranger to go about as a fair-minded judge. Subsequent to being thumped oblivious by a blast, the Stranger understands that Yeesha, Atrus' little girl, has vanished. 

The Stranger embarks to discover Yeesha, heading out to the jail Ages of Spire and Haven. On Spire, Sirrus has utilized his logical information to create explosives, enabling him to rupture the chamber that contained the connecting book back to Tomahna, and has avoided; venturing to Haven uncovers that Sirrus has likewise liberated Achenar. The Stranger adventures to the Age of Serenia and experiences Achenar, holding an "Actual existence Stone"; Achenar tells the Stranger that Sirrus is distraught and has caught Yeesha, uncovers that he kept a diary from twenty years sooner covered up on the island, and cautions the Stranger not to let Atrus come after them. Achenar's diary uncovers that he and Sirrus wanted to trap their mom Catherine on Riven and utilize a "Memory Chamber", a massive bloom like structure used to safeguard the recollections of the dead, to assume responsibility for Atrus' body and take his insight into the Art of Writing. The Life Stone that Achenar stole is utilized to control the Memory Chambers, leaving the present one in threat of breakdown. In no time a short time later, the Stranger discovers Sirrus in a submerged collector utilized for gathering memory globes for putting away those recollections; he explodes the reaper and escapes to a more seasoned Memory Chamber, bedraggled and deserted. In the wake of experiencing the Stranger there, Sirrus tells the Stranger that Achenar is the blameworthy one, and requests that the Stranger discover Atrus and convey him to Serenia to set things right. 

Finding that the old Memory Chamber entryway has been bolted by Sirrus with an exceptional shading code blend, the Stranger goes to the dynamic Memory Chamber to look for help from the Serenian Protectors, who trust that the appropriate responses can be found in their "reflect domain", referred to just as Dream. Acquiring a "soul manage", the Stranger enters Dream and connects with their guide, who instructs them to interface with the Ancestors, the spirits of all Serenians who have passed on and had their recollections protected, to bring them into amicability. In the wake of bringing the Ancestors into agreement, the Stranger finds the mix to Sirrus' shading code lock. Coming back to the "waking scene" and entering the old Memory Chamber, the Stranger discovers Yeesha lashed into a seat, and she asks to be discharged from it with a silver switch. Right then and there, Achenar lands with a crossbow and the Life Stone, and cautions that Sirrus utilized the Memory Chamber to evacuate Yeesha's recollections and move his own into her body; Achenar focuses to a golden switch, which will turn around the mind-exchange. 

Now, as in different recreations, the closure shifts. Deferring too long will result in Yeesha (who is in certainty Sirrus) taking Achenar's crossbow and shooting first him, at that point the Stranger. The silver switch will discharge Yeesha (once more, controlled by Sirrus), who drops an extensive stone on Achenar and the Stranger, and after that shoots the Stranger dead. In the great consummation, the Stranger pulls the golden switch, turning around the mind-exchange process. But since of the age of the Memory Chamber, it ends up flimsy; Achenar advises the Stranger to come back to Dream and set Yeesha's recollections right, while he utilizes the Life Stone to settle the chamber by embeddings it into the chamber's holy place, harming him with its contained dangerous spores. In Dream, the Stranger finds a colossal animal, speaking to Sirrus' Dream-structure, moored to Yeesha's substance and keeping her from coming back to her body; with no soul manage, Sirrus is compelled to stick to Yeesha to abstain from being lost for eternity. He keeps up his grapples by muddling up Yeesha's recollections. The Stranger reestablishes Yeesha's recollections and liberates her from Sirrus' grip; Sirrus' Dream-structure is crushed by the moving influxes of Dream, executing him. The Stranger stirs to discover Achenar, lethally harmed, affirming that the exchange was fruitful; he bites the dust in a matter of seconds a while later. The Stranger at that point comes back to Tomahna to meet with Atrus, who says that Catherine has taken Yeesha to Tay (the "rebel Age" used to empty Catherine's kin in "Riven"), and comments that while his children are gone, his little girl is sheltered. 

At the point when Mattel Interactive still possessed the rights to the "Myst" arrangement, advancement of "Myst IV" was contracted out to DreamForge Intertainment, designers of the amusement "Asylum"; Dreamforge was procured before Presto Studios to create "". Dreamforge's "Myst" utilized ongoing designs, and was two years into improvement and 20% complete when Ubisoft, who had by this point procured the rights to the arrangement, dropped the venture and chose to restart advancement starting with no outside help inside. 

As per GeneviÃ¨ve Lord, "Revelation"s maker, finishing up the narrative of the two siblings had initially been planned as the plot for "Myst III". Because of a restricted measure of time to build up the diversion and to not meddle with Dreamforge's "Myst" amusement, whose plot subtleties were all the while shaping, the plot was dropped. The story was then redeveloped when Ubisoft started take a shot at "Myst IV". Cyan, "Myst" and "Riven"s designer, set down "a specific number of principles" that Ubisoft needed to pursue, as indicated by Lord, yet generally the group was allowed to grow new thoughts, keeping in the soul of "Myst" legend. 

Ubisoft's advancement of "Disclosure" took more than three years and in excess of eighty representatives. From the get-go, the advancement group settled on the choice to utilize pre-rendered designs for the amusement, to coordinate the style of past "Myst" recreations. This turned out to be a test, as the studio had never built up a pre-rendered diversion, and needed to procure more than fifty new workers who had involvement in the field. Full creation was begun the diversion before aesthetic heading and motor improvement devices were completely settled, and the subsequent absence of center and correspondence implied that an awful working relationship existed between the amusement originators, software engineers, and modelers for a large portion of the generation. 

As an improvement over the prerendered innovation present in "Myst", "Riven", and "Outcast", "Disclosure" utilizes its "ALIVE" motor to invigorate about everything in the amusement. The water livelinesss, for instance, are completely rendered for every area. The trees influence in the breeze, and the sky has moving mists. Natural life incorporates animals that stroll through the earth and sporadically connect with the player. The diversion additionally includes various impacts connected progressively, for example, focal point flares, dynamic lighting, and a discretionary central haze. In a pattern begun by the first "Myst", the amusement utilizes live performing artists to assume the diversion's jobs in real to life video groupings. There are over 70 minutes of video, and the amusement enables players to glance around and collaborate with the video while it is playing. 

Jack Wall made, led, and delivered the music for "Disclosure"; the diversion was his second amusement score, following the music for "". Divider was at first a sound designer and maker, and expressed making "was somewhat similar to a following stage for me, as opposed to something I chose to do from the get-go". The achievement and acknowledgment of "Exile"s score found Wall the activity of stating "Revelation"s music with a financial plan of $100,000âdouble the sum he had worked with for "Outcast". 

Divider reused, reorchestrated and extended subjects made by past "Myst" arranger Robyn Miller; for instance, Wall reused Atrus' Theme from "Riven" and the siblings' leitmotifs from the first diversion. Divider credited the "Myst" universe and story with enabling him to compose music "Western ears are fairly less acquainted with"; "Revelation"s score was motivated by Eastern European music that Wall delighted in during the 1990s. 

Notwithstanding Jack Wall's score, the diversion includes a tune by Peter Gabriel entitled "Drapes", initially a B-side from Gabriel's single "For sure". Gabriel additionally played out a voiceover for the amusement. 

By and large, "Disclosure" was gotten emphatically by commentators; the diversion accumulated 82/100 and 82% midpoints on total locales Metacritic and GameRankings, separately; the Xbox adaptation of the amusement got less good scores than the PC rendition. Its PC rendition appeared in 6th spot on the NPD Group's business outline for the October 3â 9 period, before dropping to tenth in its second week. The diversion guaranteed positions 92 and 12 for the long stretches of September and October, individually, and sold somewhere in the range of 100,000 and 400,000 duplicates in the United States by August 2006. By that date, joined offers of all "Myst" diversions discharged during the 2000s had achieved 1.6 million units in the nation. 

Similarly as with past "Myst" recreations, the visuals and intuitiveness of "Disclosure" were singled out as the most grounded highlights. Analysts commended the utilization of unobtrusive livelinesss to breath life into the view; GameSpot's Greg Kasavin expressed that the increases "genuinely helps make every scene in the amusement appear something beyond an all encompassing picture, and rather it feels like a genuine spot". Jack Wall's score and the sound plan were reliably adulated. The expansion of the in-amusement camera and notes framework was likewise emphatically gotten. "PC Zone" declared that in spite of the fact that it would have been simple for the engineers to lose heart after the frustrating "", Ubisoft had rather created "a standout amongst the most cleaned amusements" the analyst, Paul Presley, had ever gone over. 

Certain analysts scrutinized parts of the interactivity that had not been fixed or changed from past "Myst" titles. "PC Gaming World", for instance, grumbled about chasing for the little hotspots that enabled activities to happen. A commentator for "The Houston Chronicle" made a decision about the strategy for heading out from hub to hub as tedious to explore. Another grievance was that the moderate cursor movements made scanning for activities once in a while dull. Numerous distributions noticed the fairly steep PC necessities; notwithstanding requiring a DVD-ROM drive, the diversion took up more than 7Â gigabytes when completely introduced. Charles Herold of "The New York Times", the main standard commentator with a negative perspective on "Revelation's" music, expelled the score as "dully exacting". 

"Disclosure" would be the last "Myst" amusement that utilized prerendered illustrations or full movement video. Cyan Worlds, the first designer of both "Myst" and "Riven", utilized continuous rendered illustrations for the following portion in the arrangement, "". "Myst V" was reported as the last diversion in the arrangement.
