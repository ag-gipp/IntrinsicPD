Gol Transportes AÃ©reos Flight 1907 

Gol Transportes AÃ©reos Flight 1907 was a Boeing 737-8EH on a planned household traveler departure from Manaus, Brazil, to Rio de Janeiro. On the evening of 29Â September 2006, it crashed in mid-air with an Embraer Legacy 600 business stream over the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso. The Boeing 737 separated in mid-air and collided with a region of thick wilderness, slaughtering every one of the 154 travelers and group ready; notwithstanding supporting genuine harm to one side wing and tail, the Embraer Legacy stream landed securely with its seven tenants healthy. 

The mishap was examined by the Brazilian Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center ( (CENIPA)) and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and a last report was issued in 2008. CENIPA presumed that the mishap was brought about via aviation authority (ATC) blunders joined with missteps made by the American pilots on the Legacy, while the NTSB discovered that both flight teams acted legitimately and were set on a crash course by ATC, esteeming the Legacy pilots' incapacitating of their TCAS framework to be just a contributing element as opposed to an immediate reason. 

The mishap, which set off an emergency in Brazilian common aeronautics, was the deadliest in Brazil's avionics history at the time. It remains the second most noticeably bad plane accident in Brazil, after TAM Airlines Flight 3054 of every 2007. 

The Gol Transportes AÃ©reos twin turbofan Boeing 737-8EH air ship, enrollment PR-GTD, was another Short Field Performance variation, with 186 seats (36 Economy Plus and 150 Economy seats). It made its first trip on 22 August 2006 and was conveyed to Gol on 12Â September 2006, under three weeks before the mishap. 

There were six group individuals and 148 travelers on board the Boeing carrier. The six group individuals and 105 of the travelers were Brazilian; the rest of the travelers were of different nationalities. The group comprised of Captain Decio Chaves Jr., 44, First Officer Thiago JordÃ£o Cruso, 29, and four airline stewards. The commander, who had additionally been filling in as a BoeingÂ 737 flight teacher for Gol, had 15,498 all out flight hours, with 13,521 in BoeingÂ 737 flying machine. The main officer had 3,981 complete flight hours, with 3,081 in BoeingÂ 737 flying machine. 

Gol Flight 1907 (ICAO code "GLO 1907") withdrew Eduardo Gomes International Airport in Manaus on 29Â September 2006, at 15:35 (BRT) (18:35 UTC), in transit to Rio de Janeiroâ GaleÃ£o International Airport, with an arranged middle of the road stop at BrasÃ­lia International Airport. 

The twin turbofan Embraer Legacy 600 business stream, sequential number 965 and enlistment N600XL, recently worked by Embraer and acquired by ExcelAire Service Inc. of Ronkonkoma, New York, was on a conveyance trip by ExcelAire from the Embraer processing plant to the United States. It left from SÃ£o JosÃ© dos Campos-Professor Urbano Ernesto Stumpf Airport (SJK), close SÃ£o Paulo, at 14:51 BRT (17:51 UTC), and was headed to Eduardo Gomes International Airport (MAO) in Manaus as an arranged in transit stop. 

The ExcelAire flight group comprised of Captain Joseph Lepore, 42, and First Officer Jan Paul Paladino, 34, both U.S. residents. Lepore had been a business pilot for over 20 years and had logged 9,388 absolute flight hours, with 5.5 hours in the Legacy 600. Paladino had been a business pilot for 10 years and had aggregated in excess of 6,400 flight hours, including 317 hours flying as chief of Embraer ERJ-145 and ERJ-135 fly air ship for American Eagle Airlines. (The ERJ-145 and ERJ-135 air ship are provincial planes of a similar family as the Legacy.) Paladino had additionally filled in as first officer for American Airlines, flying MD-82, MD-83 and Boeing 737-800 air ship between the U.S. what's more, Canada. The two pilots were lawfully met all requirements to fly the Embraer Legacy as skipper. 

Two of the five travelers were Embraer workers, two were ExcelAire administrators, and the fifth traveler was "The New York Times" business travel journalist Joe Sharkey, who was composing an exceptional report for "Business Jet Traveler". 

At 16:56:54 (19:56:54 UTC), the Boeing 737 and the Embraer Legacy stream impacted nearly head-on at , roughly halfway among BrasÃ­lia and Manaus, close to the town of MatupÃ¡, southeast of Manaus. The left winglet of the Embraer sheared off about portion of the 737's left wing, causing the 737 to crash and enter a wild turn, which immediately prompted an in-flight separation. At the point when the 737 was hit, the left motor stayed on the rest of the wing appended to the flying machine. The Boeing 737 collided with a zone of thick rainforest, east of the district of Peixoto de Azevedo. Every one of the 154 travelers and group on board kicked the bucket and the air ship was annihilated, with the destruction dissipated in pieces around the accident site. 

The Embraer stream, in spite of genuine harm to one side flat stabilizer and left winglet, had the capacity to keep flying, however its autopilot withdrew and it required an irregular measure of power on the burden to keep the wings level. 

With radio transfer help from Polar Air Cargo Flight 71, a Boeing 747 payload air ship flying in the region at the time, the Embraer's group effectively handled the disabled fly at Cachimbo Airport, some portion of the expansive military complex Campo de Provas Brigadeiro Velloso, at about from the crash point. 

Traveler and columnist Joe Sharkey portrayed his experience on board the Embraer in an article for "The New York Times", titled "Crashing into Death at 37,000 Feet, and Living", recorded on 1 October 2006: 

Following the Embraer's crisis arrival at the Cachimbo air base, Brazilian Air Force and AgÃªncia Nacional de AviaÃ§Ã£o Civil (ANAC) authorities kept and met the flight group. The two "secret elements"â the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and the Flight Data Recorder (FDR)â were expelled from the Embraer, and sent to SÃ£o JosÃ© dos Campos, SÃ£o Paulo, and from that point to Ottawa, Canada, at the Transportation Safety Board (TSB) research facilities, for investigation. 

In an underlying testimony, the Embraer flight team affirmed that they were cleared to flight level 370, around above mean ocean level, by BrasÃ­lia ATC, and were level at that doled out height when the impact happened. They additionally declared that they had lost contact with BrasÃ­lia ATC at the season of the crash, and their enemy of impact framework did not caution them to any approaching traffic. 

On 2 October 2006, the Embraer's commander and first officer were requested by the Mato Grosso Justice Tribunal to surrender their travel papers pending further examination. The solicitation, made by the Peixoto de Azevedo examiner, was allowed by judge Tiago Sousa Nogueira e Abreu, who expressed that the likelihood of pilot mistake with respect to the Embraer group couldn't be discounted. The Embraer team were compelled to stay in Brazil until their visas were discharged to them on 5 December 2006, over two months after the mishap, after government judge Candido Ribeiro controlled there were no legitimate reason for "limiting the opportunity of movement of the outsiders." 

Before their booked flight to the United States, the group were formally charged by Brazilian Federal Police with "imperiling an air ship", which conveys a punishment of as long as twelve years in jail. The two pilots needed to clarify why they had not exchanged on the transponder. They were permitted to leave the nation in the wake of marking a report promising to come back to Brazil for their preliminary or when required by Brazilian specialists. They grabbed their identifications and flew back to the U.S. 

The Brazilian Air Force (the ForÃ§a AÃ©rea Brasileira or "FAB") sent five fixed-wing flying machine and three helicopters to the area for a broad inquiry and salvage (SAR) activity. Upwards of 200 faculty were accounted for to be engaged with the task, among them a gathering of Kayapo individuals acquainted with the woodland. The accident site of Gol Flight 1907 was spotted on 30Â September by the aviation based armed forces, at directions , east of Peixoto de Azevedo, close Fazenda JarinÃ£, a dairy cattle farm. It was accounted for that salvage work force were experiencing issues achieving the accident site because of the thick woodland. The Brazilian air terminal working organization, Infraero, at first demonstrated the likelihood of five survivors, however a later proclamation from the Brazilian Air Force, in view of information gathered by their staff who rappelled to the accident site, and neighborhood police who aided the SAR exertion, affirmed that there were no survivors. Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva announced three days of national grieving. 

The FDR and a non-information part of the CVR from the BoeingÂ 737 were found on 2Â October 2006 and gave over to the agents, who sent them to the TSB for investigation. On 25Â October 2006, after almost a month of concentrated looking in the wilderness by around 200 Brazilian Army troops furnished with metal locators, the memory module of the Boeing's cockpit voice recorder was found. The module was found flawless, isolated from other destruction pieces, installed in about of soil, and was additionally sent for examination by the TSB in Canada. 

On 4Â October, the recuperation groups started moving the bodies to the brief base set up at the close-by JarinÃ£ farm. The FAB sent a C-115 Buffalo air ship to transport the bodies to BrasÃ­lia for distinguishing proof. 

The recuperation groups worked seriously for almost seven weeks in a thick wilderness condition, scanning for and distinguishing the exploited people's remaining parts. The majority of the unfortunate casualties had been recouped and recognized by DNA testing by 22 November 2006. 

The mishap was researched by the Brazilian Air Force's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA) and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). As per the arrangements of ICAO Annex 13, the NTSB partook in the examination as delegate for the state (nation) of assembling of the Boeing, condition of library and administrator of the Embraer, and condition of production of the Honeywell flight hardware introduced in the two planes. 

When the secret elements and correspondence transcripts were acquired, the agents met the Legacy stream's flight group and the air traffic controllers, attempting to sort out the situation which permitted two present day fly flying machine, outfitted with the most recent enemy of impact gear, to crash into one another while on instrument flights in positive control airspace. 

The Embraer's flight plan comprised of flying at FL370 up to BrasÃ­lia, on aviation route UW2, trailed by an arranged plunge at BrasÃ­lia to FL360, continuing outbound from BrasÃ­lia northwest-bound along aviation route UZ6 to the Teres fix, an aeronautical waypoint found 282Â nmi (324Â mi, 522Â km) northwest of BrasÃ­lia, where a move to FL380 was arranged. As indicated by the documented flight plan, the Embraer was planned to have been level at FL380, continuing towards Manaus, while passing the possible crash point, which was about northwest of Teres. 

The Embraer's team stated in their affidavits and resulting interviews that they were cleared via aviation authority (ATC) to FL370 for the whole trek, right to Manaus. The genuine transcript of the freedom given to the Embraer's group before departure at SÃ£o JosÃ© dos Campos at 14:41:57, as later discharged by CENIPA, was: 

November Six Zero X-beam Lima, ATC leeway to Eduardo Gomes, flight level three seven zero direct PoÃ§os de Caldas, cackle transponder code four five seven four, after take-off perform Oren takeoff. 

The Embraer's group's height freedom to FL370 was additionally affirmed after their handoff to BrasÃ­lia, amid which they had the accompanying radio trade with ATC at 15:51. 

This was the last two-way radio correspondence between the Embraer's team and ATC preceding the crash. 

The Embraer took off from SÃ£o JosÃ© dos Campos at 14:51, coming to FL370 at 15:33, after 42 minutes, where it stayed until the crash. 

ATC kept up typical two-way radio contact with the Embraer up until 15:51, when the last effective radio trade with the Embraer was made on VHF recurrence 125.05Â MHz with BrasÃ­lia Center. By then the Embraer was simply moving toward the BrasÃ­lia VOR. The Embraer overflew the BrasÃ­lia VOR at 15:55, after four minutes, and continued northwest-bound along UZ6. At 16:02, seven minutes subsequent to intersection the BrasÃ­lia VOR, optional radar contact was lost with the Embraer, in this manner halting the showcase of the Embraer's accounted for height (Mode C) on the controller's radar screen. 

No endeavor was made by either the Embraer or BrasÃ­lia Center to reach each other from 15:51 until 16:26 when, 24 minutes after the loss of optional radar contact, BrasÃ­lia Center considered the Embraer and got no answer. 

BrasÃ­lia Center at that point ineffectively endeavored to contact the Embraer six additional occasions, somewhere in the range of 16:30 and 16:34. At 16:30, the Embraer's essential radar target wound up irregular, and vanished totally from the radar screen by 16:38, after eight minutes. BrasÃ­lia Center ineffectively endeavored to impact a handoff of the Embraer to Amazonic Center at 16:53, by calling the Embraer in the visually impaired. 

The Embraer, then again, began calling BrasÃ­lia Center, likewise ineffectively, from 16:48 and proceeded with twelve increasingly fruitless endeavors until 16:53. Some restricted contact was made by then, however the Embraer was unfit to duplicate the Amazonic Center frequencies. The Embraer then proceeded with its endeavors to reach BrasÃ­lia Center, seven additional occasions until the crash. 

The impact happened at 16:56:54 (19:56:54 UTC) at FL370, and it was affirmed that neither Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) framework had enacted or cautioned its separate group, nor did any team see the approaching traffic outwardly or start any sly activity preceding the crash. While the two planes were outfitted with TCAS, it was later confirmed that the Embraer's transponder had stopped working very nearly an hour sooner, at 16:02, rendering the two planes unfit to naturally distinguish one another. 

At 16:59:50, around three minutes after the crash, Amazonic Center began to get the Embraer's optional radar answer, with its right height and last allocated code. At 17:00:30 Amazonic Center ineffectively endeavored to contact the Embraer by radio. 

The Embraer began approaching the crisis recurrence, 121.5Â MHz, following the impact, however as it was later decided in the CENIPA report, the crisis handsets in the territory were not operational and along these lines the group was unfit to reach ATC on that recurrence. 

At 17:01:06 the Embraer built up contact on the crisis recurrence with a Boeing 747 payload flying machine, Polar 71, which endeavored to transfer to ATC their solicitation for a crisis arrival, and kept on giving hand-off and interpretation help to the Embraer until its possible arrival. 

At 17:18:03 the Embraer reached the Cachimbo Airport control tower legitimately to arrange its crisis arrival there, and landed securely at Cachimbo at 17:23:00. 

Gol 1907 took off from Manaus at 15:35, flying southeast-bound along UZ6 and coming to FL370 at 15:58, after 23 minutes, where it stayed until the impact. There were no radio or radar contact issues with the trip until its handoff to BrasÃ­lia Center. There were no known endeavors by ATC to caution Flight 1907 of the clashing traffic. 

On 2 May 2007, the NTSB issued a Safety Recommendation record that incorporated a between time synopsis of the examination to date, just as some quick wellbeing suggestions that the NTSB accepts ought to be executed by the U.S. Government Aviation Administration (FAA) to improve flight security. The NTSB detailed that the Embraer obviously encountered a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) blackout, obscure to its flight team before the crash, as indicated by the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR): 

Primer discoveries in the continuous examination demonstrate that, for reasons yet to be resolved, the impact evasion framework in the Legacy plane was not working at the season of the mishap, accordingly impairing the framework's capacity to recognize and be distinguished by clashing traffic. What's more, CVR information show that the flight team was unconscious that the impact shirking framework was holding off on working until after the mishap. 

The NTSB included that the plan of the Embraer's flying is with the end goal that the non-working of the TCAS that obviously happened is appeared by a little static white instant message, which may not be recognizable by the flight team. The NTSB noted:Using just static instant messages to demonstrate lost impact evasion framework usefulness is certifiably not a dependable way to catch pilots' consideration on the grounds that these visual alerts can be not entirely obvious if their consideration is coordinated somewhere else in the flight condition. 

In light of its perceptions, the NTSB prescribed to the FAA that plan changes be actualized to improve the perceptibility of TCAS annunciation, and that the FAA educate pilots concerning all air ship types to acquaint themselves with the subtleties of this mishap, with the manners by which a pilot could coincidentally cause the loss of transponder or potentially TCAS capacity, and how to perceive lost capacity. 

On 10 December 2008, over two years after the mishap, CENIPA issued its last report, portraying its examination, discoveries, ends and suggestions. The CENIPA report incorporates an "Ends" segment that outlines the well established actualities and records an assortment of contributing elements identifying with both air traffic controllers and the Legacy stream's flight team. As indicated by CENIPA, the air traffic controllers added to the mishap by initially issuing an ill-advised leeway to the Embraer, and not getting or remedying the misstep amid the resulting handoff to BrasÃ­lia Center or later on. CENIPA additionally discovered blunders in the manner in which the controllers took care of the loss of radar and radio contact with the Embraer. 

CENIPA presumed that the ExcelAire pilots likewise added to the mishap with, in addition to other things, their inability to perceive that their transponder was accidentally turned off, in this way handicapping the impact shirking framework on both air ship, just as their generally speaking inadequate preparing and arrangement. 

The NTSB issued its own report on the mishap, which was likewise affixed to the CENIPA report with the accompanying Probable Cause proclamation: 

The proof gathered amid this examination emphatically underpins the end that this mishap was brought about by N600XL and GOL1907 following ATC clearances which guided them to work in inverse ways on a similar aviation route at a similar height bringing about a midair impact. The loss of powerful aviation authority was not the aftereffect of a solitary mistake, yet of a blend of various individual and institutional ATC factors, which reflected fundamental weaknesses in accentuation on positive airport regulation ideas. 

The NTSB further included the accompanying contributing elements: 

Adding to this mishap was the undetected loss of usefulness of the airborne crash 

evasion framework innovation because of the coincidental inactivation of the transponder on board N600XL. Further adding to the mishap was insufficient correspondence among ATC and the N600XL flight group. 

CENIPA and the NTSB worked together in the mishap examination and, while concurring on the greater part of the fundamental certainties and discoveries, the two associations landed at clashing elucidations and ends. The CENIPA report reasoned that the mishap was brought about by errors made both by ATC and by the ExcelAire pilots, while the NTSB report concentrated on the controllers and the ATC framework, presuming that both flight teams acted legitimately yet were put on a crash course by the air traffic controllers. 

As per "Aeronautics Week", "the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) firmly couldn't help contradicting the Brazilian ends seeing the Legacy pilots' activities as a causal factor, taking note of, 'The group flew the course unequivocally as cleared and agreed to all ATC directions,' as did the GOL aircrafts team." "Aeronautics Week" includes that "the Brazilian military works that nation's airport regulation framework, led the examination and composed the report." 

The accident of Flight 1907 encouraged a noteworthy emergency in Brazil's considerate avionics framework, which included extensive flight postponements and retractions, ATC attempt to-lead log jams and strikes, and open wellbeing worries about Brazil's air terminal and air traffic foundation. 

Truly, Brazil was managed by its military from 1964 until 1985. From that point forward, a non military personnel government has dominated, however the nation's aviation routes () kept on being controlled and worked by the Brazilian Air Force ("FAB") and kept running by its commanders, managed by a regular citizen barrier serve. The vast majority of Brazil's air traffic controllers are military non-charged officers, and all Area Control Centers are controlled by the FAB. 

In October 2006, as subtleties encompassing the accident of Flight 1907 started to develop, the examination appeared to be in any event mostly centered around conceivable ATC mistakes. This prompted expanding hatred by the controllers and exacerbated their effectively poor work relations with their military bosses. The controllers whined about being exhausted, come up short on, overemphasized, and compelled to work with obsolete hardware. Many have poor English aptitudes, restricting their capacity to speak with remote pilots, which assumed a job in the accident of Flight 1907. What's more, the military's finished control of the nation's flight was reprimanded for its absence of open responsibility. 

In the midst of rising strains, the air traffic controllers started arranging a progression of work activities, including log jams, walkouts, and even an appetite strike. This prompted confusion in Brazil's aeronautics industry: major deferrals and disturbances in household and worldwide air administration, stranded travelers, dropped flights, and open exhibitions. The individuals who accused different non military personnel and military authorities for the developing emergency required their renunciation. 

On 26 July 2007, after a considerably deadlier accident in Brazil (TAM Airlines Flight 3054 on 17 July 2007) killed 199 individuals, President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva terminated his protection serve, Waldir Pires, who had been accountable for the nation's flying framework and wellbeing since March 2006, and was generally scrutinized for their disappointments. Around the same time, Lula named previous Supreme Court president Nelson Jobim to supplant Pires, and promised to improve Brazil's ATC framework. 

On 6 November 2006, the groups of ten of the perished recorded a claim for carelessness against ExcelAire and Honeywell, charging that the ExcelAire pilots were flying at a "wrong elevation" and that the Honeywell transponder was not working at the season of the impact. Different suits were hence recorded for the benefit of different exploited people, with comparative claims against ExcelAire and Honeywell. The unfortunate casualties' families additionally documented suits against different U.S. based respondents, including the two Embraer pilots, just as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and Amazon Tech (makers of Brazil's ATC hardware), and ACSS (producer of the Embraer's TCAS). 

The lawyer speaking to the Embraer team, Miami-based Robert Torricella, reacted to the claim that the group was flying at a "mistaken height" by expressing that as indicated by universal guidelines, clearances and mandates issued by ATC override a recently documented flight plan, and in this case:...Â the flight plan cleared via aviation authority at the season of takeoff required the Embraer to fly right to Manaus at 37,000 feet and, missing opposite orders from airport regulation, the Embraer was committed to pursue its cleared flight plan. As the discoveries of the examination are made open, we are sure that ExcelAire's pilots will be absolved. 

A Honeywell representative expressed that "Honeywell doesn't know about any proof that demonstrates that its transponder on the Embraer Legacy was not working as structured or that Honeywell was in charge of the mishap." 

On 2 July 2008, U.S. Region Court judge Brian Cogan of the Eastern District of New York rejected the families' suits against all the U.S. based litigants under the reason of "gathering non-conveniens". Without decision on the benefits of the cases, and keeping in mind that enabling revelation to proceed, Cogan prescribed the Brazilian court framework as a progressively proper purview for the debate. 

On 1 June 2007, Murilo Mendes, a Brazilian government judge in the little city of Sinop, Mato Grosso, close to the accident site of the Boeing, prosecuted the two Embraer pilots and four BrasÃ­lia-based air traffic controllers for "presenting an airplane to risk." On 8 December 2008, he rejected charges of carelessness against the pilots, however left set up a charge of "hastiness". He additionally expelled all charges against two of the four BrasÃ­lia-based controllers and decreased the charges against the other two, yet upheld bringing new charges against a fifth controller, situated in SÃ£o JosÃ© dos Campos, the Embraer's takeoff point. On 12 January 2010, his decision was toppled by Judge Candido Ribeiro in a government court in BrasÃ­lia, restoring the carelessness charges against the pilots. 

On 26 October 2010, a military court sentenced air traffic controller Sgt. Jomarcelo Fernandes dos Santos, condemning him to 14 months in prison for neglecting to make a move when he saw that the Embraer's enemy of impact framework had been killed. Santos will stay free pending the result of the intrigue procedure. Four different controllers were vindicated for absence of confirmation. On 17 May 2011, Judge Mendes condemned air traffic controller Lucivando Tiburcio de Alencar to a term of as long as three years and four months however governed he is qualified to do network administration in Brazil rather and cleared Santos on charges of hurting Brazil's air transport security. 

On 16 May 2011, Judge Mendes condemned the two pilots to four years and four months of jail in a "semi-open" office for their job in the impact, yet he drove the sentences to network administration to be served in the United States. Brazilian specialists blamed the pilots for killing the Legacy's transponder minutes before the mishap and turning it on again simply after the accident, however it was denied by the team in an affidavit through videoconference. Mendes said in his sentence that pilots had neglected to check the working of hardware for over 60 minutes, a time span he called "an unfathomable length of time" in flight. On 9 October 2012, Brazilian government investigators declared that they had effectively bid the sentence of the pilots, requesting to expand their sentences by 17 months (an aggregate of 5 years and 9 months). The new preliminary was booked for 15 October, with the pilots again confronting preliminary in absentia. On that date, the court maintained the earlier feelings, yet altered the sentences to 37 months for each, necessitating that the pilots "report routinely to specialists and remain home during the evening." 

The Embraer Legacy 600, enlistment N600XL, remained appropriated at Cachimbo air base for very nearly three years, however in mid-2009 American organization General Aviation Services consented to purchase the airplane. The organization joined forces with Gantt Aviation and Constant Aviation to check and set up the Legacy for its exchange to the United States. When the work was finished, the air ship was re-enlisted as N965LL, and on 19 November 2010 (over four years after the mishap) it at long last touched base at Cleveland International Airport to be revamped and set available to be purchased. 

The Legacy was accounted for to be at a bargain in March 2011, despite the fact that fixes to one side wingtip and stabilizer were all the while being finished in August 2011. It was sold to a private proprietor in 2013 and enrolled in Mexico as XA-MHA. 

In 2007 Discovery Channel Brazil publicized "A TragÃ©dia do VÃ´o 1907" ("The Tragedy of Flight 1907"), a narrative about the catastrophe. 

The Mato Grosso mid-air impact was included in "Apparition Strike", a Season 5 (2008) scene of the Canadian TV arrangement "Mayday" (called "Air Emergency" and "Air Disasters" in the United States and "Air Crash Investigation" in the UK and somewhere else around the globe). The performance was communicated with the title "Demise over the Amazon" in the U.S. furthermore, "Radio Silence" in the United Kingdom. 

The flight was additionally incorporated into a "Mayday" Season 8 (2009) "Exploration of Disaster" uncommon titled "Framework Breakdown", which took a gander at the job of air traffic controllers in aeronautics calamities.
