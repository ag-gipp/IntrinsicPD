In a 2004 audit for Digitally Obsessed, Nate Meyers composed that "there are numerous amusing stiflers in this scene, particularly in the primary demonstration when Homer gets a voyage through the [mental] emergency clinic. Some smart references are made to "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", yet the second 50% of the scene isn't particularly amusing.
