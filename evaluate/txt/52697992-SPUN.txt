The fifteenth was disbanded alongside the other tank corps in January 1940; the Main Military Council considered the tank corps' execution in Poland inadmissible, trusting them to be inconvenient and hard to control. 

The corps was re-shaped in May 1942 at the Moscow Armored Training Center, almost a year after Germany had relinquished the Molotovâ Ribbentrop Pact and attacked the Soviet Union. Real General Vasily Koptsov took direction of the arrangement, which incorporated the 96th and 113th Tank Brigades, the 105th Heavy Tank Brigade, the seventeenth Motor Rifle Brigade, and the fifth Reconnaissance Battalion.

On 6 July, the military was requested to think toward the west in the Chern zone, drawing nearer to the front. The movement was finished by 9 July, and the fifteenth Tank Corps was situated in the zone of the Agnichnoye State Farm, Dupny, Bolshoy Kon, Gremyachevo, Yasnyy Lug, and Korotky, where it occupied with battle preparing and made a protective line in status to rebuff a German assault. Late that month, the 96th Brigade was exchanged to the Bryansk Front, and it was supplanted by the 195th Tank Brigade somewhere in the range of 10 and 12 August. 

Toward the beginning of August, the second Panzer Army propelled a restricted hostile towards Sukhinichi trying to wipe out a Soviet notable. The assault was at first effective, however before long hindered despite decided Soviet opposition. To dispense with the infiltration and surround the lead powers of the second Panzer Army, the Kozelsk Offensive was propelled by the third Tank Army on the eastern flank of the remarkable. On 14 August, the request was given to move to the Kozelsk region in anticipation of the assault; the military started moving the next night, the tanks being transported by rail. The hostile was planned to start on 19 August, however was deferred to 22 August after downpours turned the ways to mud, postponing the landing of the mechanized infantry and vehicles from the morning of 16 August to late on 17 August. Railroad calculated challenges brought about the exchange of work force and hardware being finished just on 21 August, and freight just before the finish of 24 August. Soviet arrangements for the assault were recognized by German insight, and the German troops in the remarkable were strengthened and started getting ready solid guarded lines. Toward the start of the hostile, the corps was at full quality, with 24 KV tanks, 87 T-34s, and 48 T-60 and 21 T-70 light tanks, an aggregate of 180 tanks. 

For the assault, Koptsov was set in order of a gathering comprising of the fifteenth Tank Corps and the 154th Rifle Division, fortified by help units. The gathering's prompt goal was to progress towards Meshalkino, Myzin, Marino, and Belyi Verkh, at that point cross the Vytebet River and build up a bridgehead on its west bank. It was a while later to encompass and annihilate German troops in the zone of Trostyapka, Perestryazh, and Belyi Verkh, working related to the sixteenth and the 61st Armies. On the main day of the assault, the 154th and 264th Rifle Divisions were sent into the assault first, however couldn't get through. The twelfth Tank Corps was focused on the battle, yet went under overwhelming German air assault and was ceased. At 12:00, a report was gotten that the third Tank Corps had seized Smetskiye Vyselkami and propelled westwards. Taking into account that the primary development was stopped by German obstruction, Western Front officer Georgy Zhukov requested the migration of the fifteenth Tank Corps to that part. The corps was to progress towards Slobodka and Belyi Verkh, yet the report of Smetskiye Vyselkami's catch ended up being false, and the fifteenth's vanguard endured substantial misfortunes moving toward the town. The 105th Heavy Tank Brigade and seventeenth Motor Rifle Brigade caught Smetskiye Vyselkami from the 56th Infantry Division's 192nd Infantry Regiment in furious battling by 17:00, yet the corps was unfit to make an achievement, getting to be postponed by troubles in crossing swampy territory, getting lost while traveling through timberland trails, and running into minefields. 

The deferrals in the development made the defensive layer linger behind the infantry, and the tank sections went under overwhelming German air assault before achieving the battle on 23 August. For the following two days, the corps progressed gradually close by different units, defeating difficult German obstruction, before at long last clearing the timberlands east of the Vytebet River of German troops on 25 August. The corps was unfit to cross the stream because of the firm German safeguards on the opposite side. The following day, to end German opposition on the left flank, where the assaults of the twelfth Tank Corps and 154th Rifle Division were ineffective, the corps was requested to pull back from the front in the Zhukovo zone and reconcentrate in the timberland west of Myzin. It was then to catch Sorokino related to the twelfth Tank Corps and 154th Rifle Division. In the wake of moving to its new beginning positions, the corps assaulted at first light on 26 August, however was again frustrated by the woodland territory. 

That day, the twelfth Tank Corps and 264th Rifle Division went under substantial weight from German tank counterattacks. On 27 August, armed force leader Prokofy Romanenko, dreading an achievement from the south, requested the fifteenth Corps to gather in the woods north of Novogryn, in availability to counterattack if a German leap forward occurred. In the occasion, before the day's over, the Soviet lines had held and the fifteenth was not required in that segment. That night, it was moved from the Myzin territory to the Pakom zone, where, together with the 61st Army's twelfth Guards Rifle Division, it was to break German opposition close Leonovo, at that point build up the leap forward towards Ukolitsa into the back of the German troops safeguarding against the 154th and 264th Rifle Divisions and the twelfth Corps at Bogdanovsky and Goskovo. On the evening of 28 August, the corps assaulted following a 30-minute big guns siege and airstrikes, however was quickly slowed down by an enemy of tank jettison ensured by minefields and big guns. Amid the night, sappers and mechanized infantry figured out how to make sections through the dump, however when the hostile was continued the following morning, the fifteenth had progressed just before it was ceased by a second enemy of tank jettison. It attempted to get through amid the day, yet couldn't cross the discard. 

The evening of 29/30 August, the corps was hauled out of the line and moved in the timberland a kilometer south of Meshalkino to do an assault on Sorokino related to the 154th Rifle Division and twelfth Tank Corps. The assault was dropped because of the overwhelming misfortunes endured by both the twelfth Tank Corps and 154th Rifle Division in the past battling, and the fifteenth additionally expected time to redesign. Amid the day the corps' 195th Tank Brigade directed the main battle activity, a fruitful task to alleviate two circled regiments of the 61st Army's 156th Rifle Division. While the primary powers of the third Tank Army had been battling at Sorokino, the third Tank Corps had made a proportion of progress, crossed the Vytebet River, and started battling to catch Volosovo. Thus, the fifteenth Corps and the 154th were moved to the Kumovo zone on the correct flank, and the fifteenth was entrusted with misusing the leap forward to catch Perestryazh. 

The reestablished assault started on 2 September yet was deferred by German air assaults. Then, a regiment from the 264th Rifle Division demonstrated unfit to cross the Vytebet River and catch the town of Ozhigovo, which was fundamental for the fifteenth Corps to misuse the leap forward. This constrained Koptsov to submit the seventeenth Motor Rifle Brigade and the 113th and 195th Brigades' engine rifle regiments to the fight. The engine rifle units crossed the Vytebet River after a short mounted guns flood and caught Ozhigovo before the day's over. The 195th Brigade's tank units moved over the Vytebet River and assaulted Perestryazh the following day, however were unfit to catch the town since they were first stopped by a gorge secured by German gunnery, and were then counterattacked to their left side flank by 40 German tanks.
