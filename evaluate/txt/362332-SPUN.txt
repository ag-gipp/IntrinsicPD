Ficus rubiginosa 

Ficus rubiginosa, usually known as the corroded fig or Port Jackson fig ("damun" in the Dharug language), is a types of blooming plant local to eastern Australia in the variety "Ficus". Starting as a seedling that develops on different plants (hemiepiphyte) or rocks (lithophyte), "F.Â rubiginosa" develops into a tree high and almost as wide with a yellow-dark colored buttressed trunk. The leaves are oval and gleaming green and measure from long and wide. 

The organic products are little, round and yellow, and can age and turn red whenever of year, cresting in spring and summer. Like all figs, the organic product is as a syconium, a rearranged inflorescence with the blooms coating an interior hole. "F.Â rubiginosa" is solely pollinated by the fig wasp species "Pleistodontes imperialis", which may involve four cryptospecies. The syconia are additionally home to another fourteen types of wasp, some of which prompt nerves while others parasitise the pollinator wasps, and somewhere around two types of nematode. Numerous types of flying creature, including pigeons, parrots and different passerines, eat the organic product. Running along the Australian east coast from Queensland to Bega in southern New South Wales (counting the Port Jackson region, prompting its elective name), "F.Â rubiginosa" develops in rainforest edges and rough outcrops. It is utilized as a shade tree in parks and open spaces, and when pruned is appropriate for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai. 

"Ficus rubiginosa" was depicted by French botanist RenÃ© Louiche Desfontaines in 1804, from a sort example whose territory is reported basically as "New Holland". In looking for the sort example, Australian botanist Dale Dixon discovered one from the herbarium of Desfontaines at Florence Herbarium and one from the herbarium of Ãtienne Pierre Ventenat at Geneva. As Ventenat had utilized Desfontaines' name, Dixon chose the Florence example to be the sort in 2001. The particular appellation "rubiginosa" identified with the corroded hue of the undersides of the leaves. Undoubtedly, "corroded fig" is an other regular name; others incorporate "Illawarra fig" and "Port Jackson fig". It was known as "damun" (pron. "hat mun") to the Eora and Darug occupants of the Sydney bowl. 

In 1806, German botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow gave it the natural name "Ficus australis" in "Species Plantarum", however this is a "nomen illegitimum" as the species previously had a legitimately distributed name. Italian botanist Guglielmo Gasparrini separated the sort "Ficus" in 1844, setting the species in the family "Urostigma" as "U.Â rubiginosum". In 1862, Dutch botanist Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel depicted "Urostigma leichhardtii" from material gathered from Cape Cleveland, Queensland, noticing it had affinities to "F. rubiginosa". In 1867, he set "Urostigma" as a subgenus in the rejoined "Ficus", which brought about the taxon getting to be "Ficus leichhardtii". Miquel likewise portrayed "Ficus leichhardtii" assortment "angustata" from Whitsunday Island, later named "F. shirleyana" by Czech botanist Karel Domin. Queensland state botanist Frederick Manson Bailey portrayed "Ficus macrophylla" assortment "pubescens" in 1911 from Queensland, Domin later renaming it "Ficus baileyana". All these taxa were observed to be undefined from (and consequently renamed as) "F.Â rubiginosa" by Dixon in 2001. 

In an examination distributed in 2008, Nina RÃ¸nsted and partners broke down the DNA arrangements from the atomic ribosomal interior and outside interpreted spacers, and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase district, in the main sub-atomic investigation of the area "Malvanthera". They discovered "F.Â rubiginosa" to be most firmly identified with the rainforest species "F.Â watkinsiana" and two shake developing (lithophytic) types of bone-dry northern Australia ("F.Â atricha" and "F.Â brachypoda"). They ordered these species in another arrangement "Rubiginosae" in the subsection "Platypodeae". Connections are vague and it is dubious into which heading the gathering emanated (into rainforest or into parched Australia). 

Joseph Maiden depicted assortment "lucida" in 1902, and Bailey portrayed assortment "glabrescens" in 1913. Both had analyzed their assortments based on their smoothness. Lady portrayed a taxon absolutely without hair, while Bailey depicted his as about glabrous (bald). As Bailey's portrayal all the more firmly coordinated Dixon's discoveries (that these variations were just halfway and not totally smooth), Dixon held Bailey's name and renamed it as "Ficus rubiginosa" forma "glabrescens" in 2001 as it contrasted just in the absence of hairs on new development from the select structure. 

A spreading, thickly shading tree when develop, "F.Â rubiginosa" may reach or more in tallness, in spite of the fact that it seldom surpasses in the Sydney area. The storage compartment is buttressed and can reach in measurement. The bark is yellow-dark colored. It can likewise develop as on different plants as a hemiepiphyte, or high lithophyte. On the other hand orchestrated on the stems, the praise (egg-formed), obovate (turn around egg-molded) or oval-molded leaves are anyplace from long and wide, on - long petioles (stalks that join the leaves to stems). They are smooth or bear small corroded hairs. There are 16 to 62 sets of sidelong veins that keep running off the midvein at an edge of 41.5â 84.0Â°, while particular basal veins keep running off the midvein at a point of 18.5â 78.9Â°. Likewise with all figs, the organic product (fig) is really an upset inflorescence (compound blossom) known as a syconium, with little blooms emerging from the fig's inward surface into an empty cavity. "F. rubiginosa" is monoeciousâboth male and female blooms are found on a similar plant, and in certainty in a similar organic product, in spite of the fact that they develop at various occasions. Regularly developing in sets, the figs are yellow at first and measure over. Aging to red in shading, they are tipped with a little areola and on a stalk. Natural products age consistently, albeit all the more so in spring and summer. A few trees have ready and unripe organic product in the meantime. 

It intently looks like its relative, the Moreton Bay fig ("F.Â macrophylla"). Having comparable ranges in the wild, they are frequently befuddled. The littler leaves, shorter organic product stalks, and corroded shade of the undersides of the leaves of "F.Â rubiginosa" are the most effortless distinctive highlights. It is additionally mistaken for the little leaved fig ("F.Â obliqua"), the syconia of which are littler, estimating 4â 12Â mm long and 4â 11Â mm in distance across, contrasted and 7â 17Â mm long and 8â 17Â mm width for "F. rubiginosa". 

"Ficus rubiginosa"s run traverses the whole eastern coastline of Australia, from the highest point of the Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland to the region of Bega on the south shore of New South Wales. The range stretches out westwards to Porcupine Gorge National Park in Queensland and the far western fields in New South Wales. "F.Â rubiginosa" f. "rubiginosa" and "F.Â rubiginosa" f. "glabrescens" are found over the vast majority of the range, however the last does not happen south past the New South Wales-Queensland outskirt area. Lithophytic, hemiepiphytic and tree structures can be discovered together in neighborhood populaces of plants. 

"F.Â rubiginosa" is found in rainforest, rainforest edges, gorges, riverbank natural surroundings, vine bushes, and rough slopes. It is found on limestone outcrops in Kanangra-Boyd National Park. Fig seedlings frequently develop from splits in stone where seeds have been held up, in areas, for example, bluffs and shake faces in common habitats, or in brickwork on structures and somewhere else in the urban condition. The dirts it develops on are regularly very much depleted and low in supplements. They are gotten from sandstone, quartzite and basalt. In the Sydney area, "F. rubiginosa" develops from ocean level to 1000Â m (3500Â ft) elevation, in zones with a normal yearly precipitation of . "F.Â rubiginosa" is to a great extent sympatric with "F.Â obliqua", however its range broadens further west into dryer locales than the last species. 

Outside its local range, "F.Â rubiginosa" has naturalized somewhat in urban Melbourne and Adelaide in Australia, just as New Zealand, Hawaii and California, and Mediterranean Europe. "F. rubiginosa" has been planted broadly in Malta since the mid 1990s yet has not been seen to organic product. 

The organic product is devoured by many flying creature species including the rose-delegated natural product dove ("Ptilinopus regina"), wompoo natural product dove ("P. magnificus"), wonga pigeon ("Leucosarcia melanoleuca"), topknot pigeon ("Lopholaimus antarcticus"), Pacific koel ("Eudynamys orientalis"), Australasian swamphen ("Porphyrio melanotus"), Australian lord parrot ("Alisterus scapularis"), Australasian figbird ("Sphecotheres vieilloti"), green catbird ("Ailuroedus crassirostris"), official bowerbird ("Sericulus chrysocephalus"), glossy silk bowerbird ("Ptilonorhynchus violaceus") and pied currawong ("Strepera graculina"), just as the mammalian dark headed flying fox ("Pteropus poliocephalus"), and spectacled flying fox ("Pteropus conspicillatus"). It is one of a few plant animal types utilized as nourishment by the imperiled Coxen's fig parrot. Numerous organic products drop onto the ground around the tree, however others are scattered by creatures that eat them. 

The thrips species "Gynaikothrips australis" benefits from the underside of new leaves of "F. rubiginosa", just as "F. obliqua" and "F. macrophylla". As plant cells kick the bucket, adjacent cells are initiated into shaping meristem tissue and a nerve results, and the leaves become misshaped and twist over. The thrips start nourishing when the tree has flushes of new development, and live for around about a month and a half. At different occasions, thrips dwell on old leaves without encouraging. The species pupates protected in the bark. The thrips stay in the nerves during the evening, meander about in the daytime and return at night, perhaps to various irritates about the tree. Psyllids have nearly defoliated trees in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney in spring. 

"F. rubiginosa" is solely pollinated in a harmonious association with "Pleistodontes imperialis", a types of fig wasp. Scholar Eleanor Haine and partners investigated the DNA of the wasp over the fig's range and decided four mysterious ancestries framing what they term the "P. imperialis" species complex. They veer to a more prominent degree than some unmistakable wasp species, yet structure a monophyletic gathering; this demonstrates the wasp heredities have part without a difference in host. 

Prepared female wasps enter the open 'fig' (the syconium) through a modest gap at the crown (the ostiole). They creep around the inflorescenced inside of the fig, pollinating a portion of the female blooms, before laying eggs inside a portion of the blossoms and biting the dust. Following half a month's improvement in their nerves, the male wasps develop before the females. They bite gaps in the nerves containing females and prepare them through the opening they have quite recently bitten. Guys return later to mated females, and broaden the mating gaps to empower the females to develop. A few guys then bite their way through the syconium divider, which enables the females to scatter subsequent to gathering dust from the now completely created male blossoms. Females at that point have a brief timeframe (< 48 hours) to discover a tree with open syconia to effectively imitate and scatter dust. 

A field ponder in Brisbane found that "F. rubiginosa" trees frequently bore both male and female stage syconia in the meantime, which could be helpful for multiplication in separated populaces. A similar report found that male stage syconia advancement endured through the winter, demonstrating that its wasp pollinator endured cooler climate than those of progressively tropical fig species. "F. rubiginosa" itself can persevere through cooler atmospheres than different individuals from the class. 

"P. imperialis" crossed the waters among Australia and New Zealand some time somewhere in the range of 1960 and 1972, and seedlings of the beforehand barren trees of "F. rubiginosa" started showing up in block and stone dividers, and on different trees, especially in parks and gardens around Auckland. They have been recorded as far south as Napier. "P. imperialis" has been transported to Hawaii, California and Israel, where it has been seen to fertilize its host. 

They can live to 100 years or more and have been known to resprout after bushfire, proving to be fruitful inside three years. 

Similarly as with numerous other "Ficus" species, the network of wasps inside the figs of "F. rubiginosa" is made up for the most part of pollinator wasps. These grow somewhere inside the syconium, apparently shielded there from parasites. Likewise present are a lot littler quantities of other wasp species, which don't fertilize the fig. Something like fourteen species have been recorded, of which fourâtwo each having a place with the genera "Sycoscapter" and "Philotrypesis"â are normal while others are uncommon. Examination of "F. rubiginosa" syconia found that the fig seeds and parasitic wasps grow nearer to the mass of the syconium. The wasps of the genera "Sycoscapter" and "Philotrypesis" are parasitic and are around a similar size as the pollinator species. Their hatchlings are thought to benefit from the hatchlings of the pollinator wasp. Male "Sycoscapter" and "Philotrypesis" wasps battle different guys of similar species when they experience each other in a "F. rubiginosa" fig. A few genera of remarkable bigger wasp species enter the juvenile figs before different wasps and initiate nerves, which may affect on quantities of pollinator wasps in the fig later. A case of this is "Pseudidarnes minerva", a metallic green wasp animal groups. 

Nematodes of the variety "Schistonchus" are found in the syconia (and the pollinator wasps) of numerous types of fig, with "F. rubiginosa" facilitating two species. They give off an impression of being less species-explicit than wasps. "S. altermacrophylla" is for the most part connected with "F. rubiginosa" however it has been recorded on a few other fig animal varieties. 

"Ficus rubiginosa" was first developed in the United Kingdom in 1789, where it is developed in glasshouses. It is regularly utilized as a huge elaborate tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and furthermore in Hawaii and California, where it is likewise recorded as an obtrusive species in certain territories. It is valuable as a shade tree in open parks and on fairways. Not as immense as different figs, "F. rubiginosa" is fit to somewhat increasingly restricted zones, for example, lining vehicle leaves or rural boulevards. In any case, surface roots can be huge and meddlesome and the meager bark promptly harmed when struck. Tolerant of corrosive or basic soils, it is solid to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, achieving 10Â m (35Â ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8â 12Â m (30â 40Â ft) separated will in the end result in a constant shelter. The trees are of extraordinary incentive in giving natural product to flying creatures and warm blooded animals, however drop vast amounts of foods grown from the ground, leaving a wreck underneath. 

In a short depiction, William Guilfoyle recorded a variegated fig from New South Wales "12â 15Â ft high" in 1911 as "F. rubiginosa" assortment "variegata". A variegated structure is in development on Australia's east coast, and in the United States. It is a fabrication ailing in chlorophyll in the second layer of the leaf meristem. The leaves have a sporadic focal green fix along the midvein with unpredictable yellow and green somewhere else. Leaves that develop in winter for the most part have bigger green patches than those that do in summer. The figment is unsteady, and parts of all-green development show up sporadically. 

In spite of the moderately vast size of the abandons, it is famous for bonsai fill in as it is very sympathetic to work with and difficult to slaughter; the leaves decrease promptly by leaf-pruning in late-spring. Portrayed as the best tree for a tenderfoot to work with, it is a standout amongst the most much of the time utilized local species in Australia. Its bark stays smooth, and does not accomplish a tough, matured appearance. Known as "Minimal Ruby", a restricted leaved structure with its causes some place north of Sydney is likewise found in development. 

"F. rubiginosa" is likewise appropriate for use as a houseplant in low, medium or splendidly lit spaces, in spite of the fact that a variegated structure requires more brilliant light. It has picked up the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It is effectively spread by cuttings or ethereal layering. 

The light-shaded wood is delicate and fragile. Lightweight, it has some an incentive really taking shape of such things as toys and little boxes.
