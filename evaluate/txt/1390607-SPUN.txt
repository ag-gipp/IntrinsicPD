The Carolwood Pacific Railroad (CPRR) was a - inch () measure ridable small scale railroad kept running by Walt Disney in the terrace of his home in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. It included the "Lilly Belle", a 1:8-scale live steam train named after Disney's better half, Lillian Disney, and worked by the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop. The train made its first trial on December 24, 1949. It pulled a lot of cargo vehicles, just as a rear that was for the most part worked by Disney himself. It was Disney's long lasting interest with trains, just as his enthusiasm for smaller than expected models, that prompted the making of the CPRR. The railroad, which wound up operational in 1950, was long and enclosed his home. The patio railroad pulled in guests to Disney's home; he welcomed them to ride and sporadically drive his smaller than usual train. In 1953, after a mishap happened in which a visitor was harmed, the CPRR was shut to the general population. 

The Carolwood Pacific Railroad roused Disney to incorporate railroad attractions in the structure for the Disneyland amusement park in Anaheim, California. Railroad attractions in Disney amusement stops the world over are currently ordinary. The horse shelter structure that was utilized as the railroad's control focus is currently at the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum in Los Angeles' Griffith Park. The "Lilly Belle", a portion of the cargo vehicles, and the rear are presently in plain view at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco, California. 

Walt Disney, the proprietor of the Carolwood Pacific Railroad, was a rail aficionado. As a young man, he needed to turn into a train engineer like his dad's cousin, Mike Martin, who drove principle line prepares on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Disney's dad filled in as a feature of a track establishment group for the Union Pacific Railroad. As an adolescent, Disney functioned as a news butcher on the Missouri Pacific Railway, where he sold papers, treats, stogies, and different items on trains. He now and again move over the delicate and into the train's taxi while the train was in movement. After he influenced the specialist and fire fighter with biting tobacco, they told him the best way to work the train. 

Disney recharged his enthusiasm for trains after wounds constrained him to quit playing polo. Looking for a more quiet recreational movement, he acquired a few Lionel train sets in late 1947. By 1948, his enthusiasm for model trains was developing into an enthusiasm for bigger, ridable smaller than expected trains subsequent to watching the trains and terrace railroad formats of a few specialists. These specialists included Disney artist Ollie Johnston, who had a ridable smaller than normal railroad, just as Disney artist Ward Kimball, who possessed the full-estimate, limited check Grizzly Flats Railroad. 

On June 1, 1949, Disney bought of empty land in the Holmby Hills territory of Los Angeles. The property comprised of a feign, which was in size, and a dimension rack of land behind it, which Disney named "Yensid Valley". "Yensid" is "Disney" spelled in reverse. Disney bought this land to manufacture another family home with an intricate lawn railroad behind it. Plans for the railroad's design included of - inch () measure track with eleven switches, just as inclinations, bridges, a trestle, and a raised soil berm. The format would totally encompass the house. Disney's better half, Lillian Disney, questioned the arrangement that piece of the design be worked in a zone where she expected to plant a blossom garden. As a trade off, Disney had a S-bend burrow worked underneath the spot where the patio nursery was in the end planted. Supported by a Walt Disney Studios lawyer, Disney had an offhanded lawful contract written to set up his entitlement to claim and work the railroad's option to proceed. He and his better half marked the agreement and their two girls saw it. Disney named his railroad "Carolwood Pacific Railroad" (CPRR) in reference to his location at 355 Carolwood Drive. The railroad in the long run expense $50,000, split uniformly between its design and moving stock. 

The railroad highlighted the "Lilly Belle", a 1:8-scale live steam train named after Disney's significant other and worked by the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop group driven by Roger E. Broggie. The train's plan, picked by Disney in the wake of seeing a littler train show with a similar structure at the home of rail student of history Gerald M. Best, depended straightforwardly on duplicates of the plans for the Central Pacific No. 173, a 4-4-0 steam train reconstructed by the Central Pacific Railroad in 1872. The initials for the Carolwood Pacific Railroad, "CPRR", coordinated the initials for the Central Pacific Railroad, one of the railways that finished the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. Under Broggie's direction, Disney helped fabricate a few sections for the "Lilly Belle", including its smokestack and headlamp. The greater part of the machining was finished by Broggie's machine shop group, and the wooden taxi was worked by Disney by and by. On December 24, 1949, the "Lilly Belle" and its delicate were first trial on a little circle of track amid the studio's Christmas party before the staff. The delicate could convey up to of water and of coal pulverized to scale-sized irregularities to fuel the train. Disney ran the "Lilly Belle" on the Carolwood Pacific Railroad out of the blue on May 7, 1950. 

The CPRR's train vehicles comprised of six cast-metal, wood-grain-designed gondolas made by the studio's machine shop. There were additionally two train units, two stock vehicles, a flatcar, and a rear made of wood from the studio's prop shop. Disney's interest with smaller than expected models was obvious from the dimension of detail he connected to the scaled down inside of the rear, which incorporated a logbook held tight the divider, a floor brush, and a working potbelly stove. With the exception of its casing and trucks, Disney assembled the whole rear himself. The majority of the train autos, aside from the rear, were put away in the CPRR's passage when not being used. 

The CPRR's rear was put away in an exceptional stable where Disney checked and controlled the CPRR's track. The stable's structure depended on a set piece for the 1949 Disney film "So Dear to My Heart", and it brought back Disney's cherished recollections of a comparative horse shelter on his family ranch in Marceline, Missouri. The animal dwellingplace had a unified traffic control board, which had a few lights intended to demonstrate the nearness of trains along the railroad's course. The CPRR's switches could likewise be electrically controlled from this board. 

Articles about the CPRR showed up in a few magazines, including the September 1951 issue of "Look" magazine. These articles pulled in guests inspired by the CPRR to the home of Disney, who welcomed them to ride and every so often drive his scaled down train. With a tractive exertion of more than , the "Lilly Belle" could destroy a train with up to 12 grown-up travelers. Because of its absence of brakes, the train was set backward on the off chance that it at any point expected to stop rapidly. In mid 1953, a guest drove the "Lilly Belle" excessively quick along a bend, making it wreck. Thus, the "Lilly Belle" fell on its side, broke its whistle, and discharged a stream of steam over the ground. A five-year-old young lady went through the steam stream, which left minor consumes on her legs. Because of this episode, Disney, dreading the likelihood of future mishaps, shut down the CPRR and put away the train in the studio's machine shop. Disney evacuated the Carolwood Pacific Railroad's track in 1964. 

Walt Disney credited the Carolwood Pacific Railroad with motivating the making of Disneyland in Anaheim, California. In one early idea for the recreation center, the CPRR was incorporated as a fascination, in which its train would convey travelers past small scale towns and settings. The Casey Jr. Carnival Train, an alternate ridable smaller than normal railroad that movements past scaled down scenes of energized Disney films, is one of Disneyland's unique attractions. Another early plan for the recreation center incorporated a thin check steam railroad circling it, an element which was held in the recreation center's last structure. Disneyland, and the Disneyland Railroad enclosing the recreation center, opened on July 17, 1955. The Disneyland Railroad's No. 1 train, the "C.K. Holliday", looks to some extent like the CPRR's "Lilly Belle", since their structures depended on similar outlines. There are likewise steam railways in the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World close Orlando, Florida; Tokyo Disneyland in Japan; and Disneyland Park close Paris. 

Duplicates of the plans for the CPRR's Lilly Belle were sold to demonstrate railroad specialists through an organization named "Walt Disney Miniature Railroad", shaped by Disney in 1950 as a legitimately independent substance from Walt Disney Productions. After that organization advanced into Walt Disney, Inc., in 1952 and had its name changed to WED Enterprises in 1953, it created rides and attractions for Disneyland and later Walt Disney World. In 1965, Walt Disney Productions acquired WED Enterprises, and in 1986 changed its name to Walt Disney Imagineering. As indicated by "Los Angeles" magazine, the CPRR's animal dwellingplace has been alluded to as the "origination of Imagineering". 

Just as moving rail attractions at Disney amusement stops, the CPRR turned into the motivation for the 1951 Disney enlivened short film "Out of Scale", in which Donald Duck is depicted running a ridable little railroad in his terrace. The train of the CPRR additionally showed up in a few Disney TV specials during the 1950s. 

In 1965, Walt Disney gave of the Carolwood Pacific Railroad's track, just as the railroad's trestle, to the Los Angeles Live Steamers, a gathering of smaller than normal steam train lovers. Disney was a sanction individual from that gathering. The culmination of the CPRR's track establishment at the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum in Los Angeles' Griffith Park was praised on October 22, 1966, and the course using that track wound up known as the "Disney Loop". This occasion happened half a month prior to Disney's demise on December 15, 1966. In 1968, Lillian Disney gave the remainder of the CPRR's track to the Los Angeles Live Steamers. The first CPRR track on the Disney Loop has since been evacuated and supplanted with more up to date, progressively tough track. 

After Lillian Disney passed on in 1997, the Disney home, including the region where the CPRR was found, was set available to be purchased. Mexican financial specialist Gabriel Brener, who purchased the property in 1998, obliterated the first house because of issues with lead paint, lead channeling, asbestos, and a feeble establishment. The CPRR's passage was still set up in 2013. In 2014, the property was sold to an obscure purchaser. 

In 1999, Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn, the CPRR's previous control focus, was migrated to the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum. Morgan "Bill" Evans, the first exterior decorator of the Disney home and a few Disney amusement parks, orchestrated Walt Disney Imagineering to give a finishing plan to the horse shelter's new site. On July 19, 1999, Diane Disney Miller, Disney's girl, took an interest in the rededication function for the horse shelter. 

Since 2009, the CPRR's "Lilly Belle", a portion of the cargo vehicles, and the rear have been in plain view at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco, California. There are likewise two bits of CPRR moving stock in plain view inside the Carolwood Pacific Railroad Room in the Boulder Ridge Villas at Disney's Wilderness Lodge inside Walt Disney World.
