Group Meat additionally incorporates soundtrack arranger Danny Baranowsky and audio effects creator Jordan Fehr. As per the engineers, "Super Meat Boy" is "a major return to a great deal of very bad-to-the-bone NES works of art like "Ghosts'n Goblins", "Uber Man", and the Japanese form of """, with the plot composed as "a blend of each videogame story from the mid 90s".
