The group plays its home matches at Kenilworth Road, where it has been based since 1905. The club's history incorporates real trophy wins, a few money related emergencies, various advancements and assignments, and a few spells of supported achievement. It was maybe most conspicuous somewhere in the range of 1982 and 1992, when it was an individual from English football's top division, around then the First Division; the group won its solitary significant respect, the Football League Cup, in 1988.

It joined the Football League before the 1897â 98 season, left in 1900 in light of money related issues, and rejoined in 1920. Luton achieved the First Division in 1955â 56 and challenged a noteworthy last out of the blue when playing Nottingham Forest in the 1959 FA Cup Final. The group was then consigned from the top division in 1959â 60, and downgraded twice more in the accompanying five years, playing in the Fourth Division from the 1965â 66 season. Be that as it may, it was elevated back to the top dimension by 1974â 75. 

Luton Town's latest effective period started in 1981â 82, when the club won the Second Division, and along these lines picked up advancement to the First. Luton crushed Arsenal 3â 2 in the 1988 Football League Cup Final and stayed in the First Division until transfer toward the finish of the 1991â 92 season. Somewhere in the range of 2007 and 2009, monetary troubles made the club tumble from the second level of English football to the fifth in progressive seasons. The remainder of these assignments came amid the 2008â 09 season, when 30 were docked from Luton's record for different monetary anomalies. Luton from that point burned through five seasons in non-League football before winning the Conference Premier in 2013â 14, verifying advancement over into the Football League. 

Luton Town Football Club was shaped on 11 April 1885. Prior to this there were numerous clubs in the town, the most unmistakable of which were Luton Wanderers and Luton Excelsior. A Wanderers player, George Deacon, concocted the possibility of a "Town" club which would incorporate all the best players in Luton. Drifters secretary Herbert Spratley seized upon Deacon's thought and orchestrated a mystery meeting on 13 January 1885 at the St Matthews school rooms in High Town. The Wanderers board made plans to rename the club Luton Townâwhich was not generally welcomed by the more extensive network. The neighborhood papers alluded to the club as "Luton Town (late Wanderers)". At the point when George Deacon and John Charles Lomax then masterminded an open gathering with the motivation behind shaping a "Luton Town Football Club", Spratley dissented, saying there was at that point a Luton Town club; and the climate was tense when the gathering assembled in the town lobby on the 11 April 1885. The gathering, gone to by most football sweethearts in the town, found out about Spratley's mystery January meeting and voted against his complaints. The movement to shape a "Luton Town Football Club", set forward by GÂ H Small and supported by EÂ H Lomax, was conveyed. A club board of trustees was chosen by vote and the group hues were consented to be pink and dim blue shirts and tops. 

At first based at Excelsior's Dallow Lane ground, Luton Town started making installments to certain individual players in 1890. The next year, Luton turned into the primary club in southern England to be completely proficient. The club was an author individual from the Southern Football League in the 1894â 95 season and completed as sprinters up in its initial two seasons. It at that point left to help structure the United League and came next in that alliance's debut season before joining the Football League (at that point based generally in northern and focal England) for 1897â 98, simultaneously moving to another ground at Dunstable Road. The club kept on entering a group to the United League for two additional seasons, and won the title in 1897â 98. Poor participation, high wages and the high travel and convenience costs that came about because of Luton's separation from the northern heartlands of the Football League disabled the club monetarily, and made it too costly to even think about competing in that association. An arrival toward the Southern League was hence organized the 1900â 01 season. 

Eight years in the wake of touching base at Dunstable Road, Luton moved once more, settling at their present ground, Kenilworth Road, in 1905. Chief and left winger Bob Hawkes turned into Luton's first universal player when he was picked to play for England against Ireland on 16 February 1907. A poor 1911â 12 season saw Luton consigned toward the Southern League's Second Division; the club won advancement back two years after the fact. After the First World War broke out, Luton participated in The London Combination amid 1915â 16, and a while later filled each season with agreeable matches. A key player of the period was Ernie Simms, a forward. Simms was invalided back to England in the wake of being injured on the Italian front, however recouped enough to recapture his place in the Luton group and scored 40 objectives amid the 1916â 17 season. 

The Luton side originally played in the white and dark hues which it has held for quite a bit of its history amid the 1920â 21 season, when the club rejoined the Football League; the players had recently worn a variety of shading mixes, most for all time sky blue shirts with white shorts and naval force socks. Such was the nature of Luton's group as of now that in spite of playing in the third level, an installation among Ireland and England at Windsor Park on 22 October 1921 saw three Luton players on the pitchâLouis Bookman and Allan Mathieson for Ireland, and the club's top goalscorer, Simms, for England. Be that as it may, after Luton completed fourth in the division, the squad was separated as Simms, Bookman and Mathieson joined South Shields, Port Vale and Exeter City individually. Luton remained in the Third Division South until 1936â 37, when the group completed top and won advancement to the Second Division, around then the second level of English football. Amid the advancement season, striker Joe Payne scored 55 objectives in 39 recreations; amid the past season he had scored 10 of every one match against Bristol Rovers, which remains a Football League record today. 

Amid the mid 1950s, one of Luton's most prominent sides rose under administrator Dally Duncan. The group included Gordon Turner, who proceeded to turn into Luton's unsurpassed top goalscorer, Bob Morton, who holds the record for the most club appearances, and Syd Owen, an England universal. Amid this period, Luton sides additionally highlighted two England global goalkeepers, Ron Baynham and Bernard Streten, just as Irish internationals Seamus Dunne, Tom Aherne and George Cummins. This group achieved the top trip without precedent for 1955â 56, subsequent to completing the season in second spot behind Birmingham City on objective normal. A couple of long stretches of progress pursued, including a FA Cup Final appearance against Nottingham Forest in 1958â 59; toward the finish of the period, Owen was casted a ballot FWA Footballer of the Year. Be that as it may, the club was consigned the accompanying season and, by 1964â 65, was playing in the fourth level. 

In yo-yo club style, Luton were to return. A group including Bruce Rioch, John Moore and Graham French won the Fourth Division title in 1967â 68 under the authority of previous player Allan Brown; after two years Malcolm Macdonald's objectives helped them to another advancement, while entertainer Eric Morecambe turned into an executive of the club. Luton Town won advancement back to the First Division in 1973â 74, yet were consigned the accompanying season by a single point. Previous Luton player David Pleat was made administrator in 1978, and by 1982â 83 the group was back in the top flight. The group which Pleat gathered at Kenilworth Road was eminent at the ideal opportunity for the quantity of dark players it included; amid a period when numerous English squads were as a rule white, Luton regularly handled a for the most part dark group. Skilled players, for example, Ricky Hill, Brian Stein and Emeka Nwajiobi made key commitments to the club's prosperity amid this period, making it collect "a more extravagant history of dark stars than any in the nation", in the expressions of columnist Gavin Willacy. 

On the most recent day of the 1982â 83 season, the club's initially back in the top level, it barely gotten away transfer: playing Manchester City at Maine Road, Luton expected to win to keep awake, while City could escape with a draw. A late champ by Yugoslavian substitute Raddy AntiÄ spared the group and provoked Pleat to move over the pitch playing out a "dance of delight", a picture that has turned out to be notable. The club accomplished its most noteworthy ever alliance position, seventh, under John Moore in 1986â 87, and, overseen by Ray Harford, won the Football League Cup a year later with a 3â 2 success over Arsenal. With ten minutes left on the clock and Arsenal 2â 1 ahead, a punishment spare from remain in goalkeeper Andy Dibble started a late Luton rally: Danny Wilson evened out, before Brian Stein scored the victor with the last kick of the match. The club achieved the League Cup Final yet again in 1988â 89, however lost 3â 1 to Nottingham Forest. 

The club was consigned from the top division toward the finish of the 1991â 92 season, and sank to the third level four years after the fact. Luton remained in the third-level Second Division until assignment toward the finish of the 2000â 01 season. Under the administration of Joe Kinnear, who had arrived part of the way through the past season, the group won advancement from the fourth level at the primary endeavor. "Questionable" proprietor John Gurney disrupted the club in 2003, ending Kinnear's agreement on his entry in May; Gurney supplanted Kinnear with Mike Newell before leaving Luton as the club entered organization. Newell's group completed as victors of the rebranded third-level Football League One in 2004â 05. 

While Newell's place was taken first by Kevin Blackwell and later previous player Mick Harford, the group was then consigned twice straight, beginning in 2006â 07, and spent the last piece of the 2007â 08 season in organization, accordingly causing a ten-point reasoning from that season's aggregate. The club at that point had a sum of 30 docked from its 2008â 09 record by the Football Association and the Football League for money related anomalies going back quite a while. These reasonings turned out to be too vast an obstruction to survive, however Luton dug out from a deficit in the last of the Football League Trophy to win the challenge out of the blue. 

Transfer implied that 2009â 10 saw Luton playing in the Conference Premier, a challenge in which the club had at no other time taken an interest. The club fruitlessly challenged the advancement play-offs multiple times in four seasons amid their time as a non-League club, utilizing five unique administrators. In the 2012â 13 FA Cup fourth round, Luton won their away tie against Premier League club Norwich City 1â 0 and, in doing as such, turned into the first non-League group to beat a side from England's top division since 1989. In the 2013â 14 season, under the administration of John Still, Luton won the Conference Premier title with three recreations to save, and along these lines verified an arrival to the Football League from 2014â 15. Another advancement pursued three years after the fact, returning Luton in League One from the beginning of the 2018â 19 battle.

Luton for the most part wore a mix of light blue and white before 1920, when white shirts and dark shorts were first embraced. These hues were held for over 50 years, with the shade of the socks shifting among white and dark, until Luton changed to orange, naval force and white toward the beginning of the 1973â 74 season.

Naval force shorts were readopted in 2011. Luton are wearing orange shirts, naval force shorts and white socks amid the 2015â 16 season. 

Luton Town have generally utilized the town's peak as its very own in a way like numerous different groups. The club's first identification was a white eight-pointed star, which was embellished over the group's shirts (at that point a profound cochineal red) in 1892. After four years a peak including the club's initials entwined was quickly embraced. The shirts were from that point plain until 1933, when Luton first embraced an identification portraying a straw boater, which showed up on Luton shirts. The letters "LTFC" were included 1935, and this fundamental plan stayed until 1947. The club at that point played without an identification until 1970, when the club started to wear the town peak normally, having first done as such in the 1959 FA Cup Final. 

In 1973, simultaneously with the club's change to the orange unit, another identification was presented highlighting the new hues. The new symbol portrayed a stylised orange football, bearing the letters "Lt", encompassed by the club's name in naval force blue content. In 1987, the club changed back to a subordinate of the town token, with the shield segment of the heraldic peak turning into the group's identification; the main comparability with the past plan was the incorporation of the club name around the shield in naval force blue. The "rainbow" identification, presented in 1994, highlighted the town peak beneath an orange and blue bow which bended around to meet two footballs, situated on either side of the shield, with the club name underneath. This identification was utilized until 2005, when a substitution fundamentally the same as the 1987 adaptation was embraced, including dark content as opposed to blue and a straw boater instead of the outstretched arm delineated in the more established plan. The club's establishing year, 1885, was included 2008. The identification was modified yet again amid the 2009â 10 pre-season, with the red of the town peak being supplanted with orange to all the more likely mirror the club hues.
