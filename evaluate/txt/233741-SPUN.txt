Charles Stewart (Canadian legislator) 

Charles Stewart, (August 26, 1868 â December 6, 1946) was a Canadian legislator who filled in as the third Premier of Alberta from 1917 until 1921. Conceived in Strabane, Ontario, in Wentworth County, Stewart was a rancher who moved west to Alberta after his homestead was decimated by a tempest. There he ended up dynamic in governmental issues and was chosen to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 1909 race. He filled in as Minister of Public Works and Minister of Municipal Affairsâthe principal individual to hold the last position in Albertaâin the administration of Arthur Sifton. At the point when Sifton left commonplace legislative issues in 1917 to join the government bureau, Stewart was named his substitution. 

As head, Stewart attempted to hold together his Liberal Party, which was isolated by the Conscription Crisis of 1917. He attempted to uphold denial of mixed drinks, which had been revered in law by a choice amid Sifton's prevalence, yet discovered that the law was not generally enough bolstered to be adequately policed. His administration assumed control more than a few of the region's monetarily pained railways, and ensured securities sold to support water system ventures. A few of these arrangements were the aftereffect of campaigning by the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA), with which Stewart appreciated great relations; all things considered, the UFA was politicized amid Stewart's prevalence and ran competitors in the 1921 race. Unfit to coordinate the UFA's intrigue to rustic voters, Stewart's administration was crushed at the surveys and he was prevailing as chief by Herbert Greenfield. 

In the wake of leaving common legislative issues, Stewart was welcome to join the government bureau of William Lyon Mackenzie King, in which he filled in as Minister of the Interior and Mines. In this limit he marked, in the interest of the government, an understanding that exchanged control of Alberta's characteristic assets from Ottawa to the common governmentâa concession he had been reprimanded for being unfit to consult as Premier. He served in King's bureau until 1930, when the King government was vanquished, however remained an individual from Parliament until he lost his seat in 1935. He kicked the bucket in December 1946 in Ottawa. 

Charles Stewart was conceived on August 26, 1868, in Strabane, Ontario, on Wentworth County, to Charles and Catherine Stewart. Charles Sr. was a stonemason and rancher. As a kid, Charles Jr. went with his dad to Carlisle to hear Canadian Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald. As per family legend, Macdonald saw the youthful future Premier and disclosed to him that he was a fine kid who might make a decent legislator sometime in the not so distant future. At the point when Charles Jr. was 16, he moved with his family to a ranch close Barrie. After seven years, on December 17, 1891, he wedded Jane Russell Sneath; the pair had eight youngsters. Subsequent to wedding Sneath, he changed over to her Church of England confidence. 

In 1892, Charles Sr. kicked the bucket, leaving his child accountable for the family ranch. After twelve years, this ranch was annihilated by a tempest, and Stewart chose to move west, settling close Killam, Alberta in 1906. His family persevered through a virus winterâthe hottest spot in their shack was on the kitchen table, so they kept the child thereâand in the spring their harvests were pulverized by hail. As he was fruitless at cultivating, he enhanced his pay utilizing the stonemason's aptitudes he had gained from his dad: he established frameworks for the Canadian Pacific Railway, took a shot at the High Level Bridge in Edmonton, and burrowed Killam's town well. He later worked in land and as a ranch actualize vendor, gaining enough to purchase another and bigger estate in 1912. 

Stewart was dynamic in his nearby network: he was the primary seat of the Killam School District, went to the main gathering of Killam ratepayers on January 19, 1907, and was engaged with the fuse of Killam in January 1908. In 1909, the Alberta Liberal Party, which had overwhelmed common legislative issues all through Alberta's short history, came looking for a possibility to keep running in the new riding of Sedgewick. Stewart consented to run and was chosen by approval in the 1909 race. 

At the season of Stewart's applause, Premier Alexander Cameron Rutherford appeared to be unassailable: he controlled 36 of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta's 41 seats (Stewart's being one), and his Liberals had recently won about 60% of the vote in their re-appointment offer. Months after the fact, be that as it may, Rutherford and his administration were involved in the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway embarrassment, and the Liberal Party was part. At first, Stewart stayed faithful to Rutherford, and ventured to such an extreme as to affirm in the lawmaking body that radical Liberal John R. Boyle had offered two individuals from the authoritative get together (MLAs), who were additionally inn guardians, insusceptibility from arraignment for alcohol infringement on the off chance that they would bolster another legislature in which Boyle was Attorney-General. As extra subtleties of the outrage developed, be that as it may, Stewart himself turned into a guerilla, and was satisfied when Arthur Sifton supplanted Rutherford as Premier. 

In May 1912, Sifton extended his bureau, and Stewart was made the territory's first Minister of Municipal Affairs. As was required by the custom of the day when a MLA was selected to bureau, he surrendered his seat to keep running in a by-decision, in which he effectively crushed Conservative William John Blair. In bureau, he ended up known as a backer of open responsibility for, which put him more in compassion for the Conservative resistance than with Sifton. Regardless of this position, he supported Sifton's 1913 goals to the Alberta and Great Waterways issue, which included banding together with the private segment; this vote denoted the first occasion when that the Liberal council was joined on the railroads question since before the outrage broke in 1910. 

In December 1913, Sifton moved Stewart from Municipal Affairs into the Public Works portfolio; in this limit, Stewart assumed a noteworthy job in the fuse of the Alberta Farmers' Co-employable Elevator Company, which was a rancher run co-usable with a contract to possess and work grain lifts. 

Soon after the 1917 commonplace race (in which Stewart and the Liberals were both soundly re-chose), Canada ended up involved in an enrollment emergency. The administrative Conservative government, driven by Robert Borden, upheld executing induction. The resistance Liberals, driven by Wilfrid Laurier, ostensibly contradicted enrollment, yet numerous English-speaking Liberals in truth upheld it. The emergency was settled when Borden framed a Union government made out of Conservatives and ace induction Liberals. Sifton, falling into the last gathering, was picked as Alberta's agent in that legislature, and surrendered as Premier in October 1917. Lieutenant-Governor Robert Brett, tolerating Sifton's decision of successor, requested that Stewart structure a legislature. His solitary genuine adversary for the situation of chief was Charles Wilson Cross, who contradicted enrollment and was hence not an acceptable decision for a great part of the Liberal foundation. 

The Alberta and Great Waterways outrage had opened up a fracture in the common Liberal Party, between the individuals who stayed faithful to Cross and Rutherford and the individuals who did not, with the last gathering being driven by William Henry Cushing and Frank Oliver. Sifton had papered over, if not in reality mended, this crack, and it didn't blast open again until the induction emergency. This time, nonetheless, the blame lines were extraordinary: Cross and Oliver had set aside their long-lasting hostility to participate in contradicting induction, and Sifton, who had been chosen Premier partially on the grounds that he was not related to either group in the old fight, was Alberta's most noticeable genius enrollment Liberal. 

Stewart was a supporter of induction and of the Union government, yet did not take any dynamic part in the caustic 1917 administrative race, which was battled on the issue. A few of his clergymen were not all that prudent: Attorney-General Cross, Education Minister Boyle, and Municipal Affairs Minister Wilfrid GariÃ©py battled for the Laurier Liberals; Public Works Minister Archibald J. McLean and Treasurer Charles R. Mitchell avoided the brawl while leaving no uncertainty of their help for Union. Amid the main authoritative session after this race, Stewart went under assault from individuals from his own gathering. Alexander Grant MacKay reprimanded his inability to exploit the ongoing meeting of premiers to press for the exchange of rights over Alberta's characteristic assets from the administrative to the commonplace government (Sifton had made this a need amid the pre-war years, yet had to a great extent stopped his backing on the breakout of threats), and James Gray Turgeon assaulted the administration's strategy of requiring charges for the help of warriors' dependants in light of the fact that he thought of it as a bureaucratic duty. 

Divisions inside the commonplace Liberals reached a crucial stage in August 1918, when Stewart expelled Cross as Attorney-General. It later risen that Cross had wouldn't fire two analysts in his area of expertise after Stewart had inferred that their work would be better done by the common police, and that Stewart had observed Cross' work to be commonly poor. He had requested Cross' acquiescence, got no reaction, and revoked the Order in Council naming him. With an end goal to verify Cross' takeoff from legislative issues, Stewart offered him the situation of Alberta's commonplace operator in London, England; Cross rejected it, and Stewart was reprimanded for utilizing arrangements for political favorable position. 

Alberta had executed restriction in 1916 as the aftereffect of a choice upheld by the incredible United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) anteroom gathering. When Stewart got to work, it was getting to be clear that the arrangement was not being all around agreed to: Conservative MLA George Douglas Stanley asserted that judges were frequently hungover when they sat in judgment of those blamed for abusing alcohol laws, and Cross' substitution as Attorney-General, John Boyle, conceded that in his estimation 65% of the territory's male populace broke the Prohibition Act. In 1921 the legislature acknowledged benefits of $800,000 on liquor lawfully sold for "therapeutic" purposes, and Boyle evaluated peddlers' benefits at multiple times that figure. Stewart accused the issues for deficient open help for the law, yet even as he did as such obviously there was insufficient help to cancel it. 

Restriction was not by any means the only UFA-supported strategy to have been passed by Sifton's administration: for sure, the enactment that took into consideration resident started referenda of the sort that had prompted forbiddance was itself the consequence of UFA promotion. When Stewart wound up Premier, he focused on the presentation of another UFA-favored fair changeâcorresponding portrayal. Notwithstanding, a council framed to look at the likelihood broke down over what antiquarian Carrol Jaques calls "fights inside the gathering and a general aversion of the idea". 

Railroad improvement had commanded the premierships of Stewart's ancestors and, while losing political strength as an issue, it was as yet an issue that requested his consideration. Despite the fact that Sifton had built up a railroad strategy in 1913 that was acceptable to all wings of the Liberal Party, the episode of the First World War the next year had everything except put a conclusion to rail line development crosswise over Canada. When harmony came, Albertans living close guaranteed however up 'til now unbuilt lines started to fuss for their finishing. The privately owned businesses with whom the legislature had banded together, notwithstanding, were in no situation to attempt the development. The Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway was taken over by the Canadian Pacific Railway, with a proviso in the understanding requiring the commonplace government to burn through $1 million to improve the course, and the Alberta and Great Waterways was taken over by Stewart's administration legitimately (J. D. McArthur, the line's past proprietor, held a choice to repurchase it, however it was never worked out). 

Water system extends likewise involved a lot of Stewart's consideration as Premier. As with railroads, the First World War had disturbed arranged water system undertakings, and Albertan ranchers, particularly those from the bone-dry south, were anxious to see them continued. Explicitly prevalent was an undertaking to water in Lethbridge County, however when bonds were issued to fund the venture, they didn't sell. Stewart looked for government support of the bonds, however Prime Minister Arthur Meighen declined. Stewart reluctantly consented to offer a common assurance, yet to dodge negative response from northern Alberta he connected the empowering enactment to one taking into consideration waste in northern regions. 

The United Farmers of Alberta had its beginnings as a ranchers' support association; Stewart, a rancher, had gone along with it. The UFA had accomplished a few triumphs in managing the Sifton government, and Stewart likewise tried to collaborate with it. The water system venture was emphatically bolstered by the UFA, similar to Stewart's activity on corresponding portrayal. At the point when Peace River MLA William Archibald Rae acquainted enactment with enable Imperial Oil to manufacture a pipeline in the territory, UFA President Henry Wise Wood sent Stewart a message of challenge, as he trusted that pipelines ought to be normal bearers; Stewart read it in the governing body, and Rae's bill was pulled back. Indeed, even given the triumphs, the UFA was not happy with the administration's record: in 1918, the legislature made a move on just three of the numerous goals the UFA had sent to it. 

Some in the UFA had since quite a while ago supported challenging decisions legitimately as an ideological group as opposed to staying on the sidelines as a weight gathering, yet Wood and other UFA pioneers were relentlessly contradicted to the thought. Amid the war, notwithstanding, the political wing started to pick up force, and at the 1919 UFA tradition, it was chosen that UFA competitors would challenge the following commonplace race. Truth be told, it wound up doing as such to some degree sooner: in 1919, Charles W. Fisher, Liberal MLA for Cochrane, kicked the bucket because of that year's flu pestilence, and a by-race was required to supplant him. The UFA's Alex Moore vanquished his solitary adversary, Liberal Edward V. Thomson, by 835 votes to 708. 

Stewart felt double-crossed: "It has been my battle as far back as I turned into a pastor to see that the ranchers of the region were having a square arrangement," he commented, "and I think I have done this with some achievement." Despite his general compassion for the points of the UFA, he couldn't bolster their progress into an ideological group. For one, he couldn't help contradicting the UFA's conviction that legislative issues ought to be led along class, as opposed to ideological, lines. Stewart trusted that "the more unequivocally outfitted the classes become the harder will it be to get the things we truly need in our legislature" and declared that "I never did and never will want to shape an alliance with anyone aside from with men who figure equivalent to I do." 

Given the UFA's formal reception of the objective of supplanting Stewart's Liberal government with a Farmer government, it remained shockingly inviting towards the Premier. While crusading for Moore amid the Cochrane by-race, Wood called Stewart "a decent, upstanding resident, doing as well as could be expected under troublesome conditions" and flaunted that "in the event that I must tear down the character of a fair man to develop something that I need, I am not going to develop it." When finally the general decision came, in 1921, the UFA declined to run a hopeful in Stewart's Sedgewick riding as an indication of regard to the Premier. After the UFA cleared to triumph, there was even theory that Stewart, still a UFA part, would remain on as Premier of another Farmer's legislature (as a major aspect of its resistance to "old style governmental issues," the UFA had challenged the race without assigning a pioneer), yet he declared something else. 

The last commonplace decision had been held in June 1917, and four years was the ordinary existence of a lawmaking body in Canada. Stewart called a race for July 19. In spite of the fact that the Liberals' fortunes had been drooping in the post-war years, there remained almost certainly that they could again crush the Conservatives; their genuine test was clearly from the recently politicized UFA. Supporting this test by expanding ranchers' discontent was a breakdown of rural costs. The UFA had no pioneer, no fixed stage, and no tendency to assault Stewart or his administration. What it had was predominant association, and on race day this association made itself felt as thirty-nine UFA individuals chose to fourteen Liberals. Stewart, who has been acclaimed in his very own riding of Sedgewick, reported that he would leave as Premier when the UFA had chosen someone to supplant him. When it chose Herbert Greenfield, Stewart followed through on his vow, and Greenfield supplanted him August 13. 

In Jaques' view, Stewart was characterized by what he was most certainly not: 

he was not associated with any of the railroad outrages, current or past; he was not obviously engaged with any of the individual fights that had devoured Alexander Rutherford, Frank Oliver, the siblings Arthur and Clifford Sifton, Charles Cross, or any of their supporters; he was not a powerful flashy Liberal divided; he didn't give himself a chance to get associated with government Liberal Party intrigues over issues, for example, the induction emergency; nor did he appear to be oppressive or domineeringâan analysis leveled at his ancestor, Arthur Sifton. 

She contends that he was a "better than average family man" whose vocation was a result of the conditions in which he got himself. 

History specialist L. G. Thomas perceived Stewart's splendid characteristics, yet censured him for coming up short on Sifton's "heartless and mighty authority" and guaranteed that "couple of commonplace premiers have been all the more all around adulated by their adversaries and all the more collectively regretted by their supporters." Even along these lines, he recognized that the definitive factor in Stewart's destruction was nothing that he did, yet the choice by the UFA to run competitors in 1921; in Thomas' view, Sifton would have been vanquished in 1917 in the event that he had needed to battle with a politicized UFA. 

Mount Charles Stewart is situated in the Bow Valley only north of Canmore. The pinnacle was named for him in 1928. 

Following the 1921 government race, William Lyon Mackenzie King's Liberals came to control in Ottawa. They had not won any seats in Alberta, and Stewart was welcome to join King's bureau as Minister of the Interior and Mines (which included duty as Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs). He won a 1922 by-race in the Quebec seat of Argenteuil, before moving to the more commonplace domain of Edmonton West in the 1925 race; he was re-chosen there in 1926 and 1930. In the 1935 decision, he kept running in the new riding of JasperâEdson, where he was crushed by Social Crediter Walter Frederick Kuhl. 

As a bureau serve, Stewart forcefully advertised Canada's coal both locally and globally, for which he was regarded by Alberta's coal makers at a dinner and later granted the Randolph Bruce Gold Medal in Science by the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. He took an extraordinary enthusiasm for water control, and exhorted the legislature on jurisdictional issues encompassing the Niagara, St. Mary, and Milk Rivers. In 1927, he filled in as Canada's agent at the League of Nations. As Minister of the Interior, he managed the 1927 formation of Prince Albert National Park. Unexpectedly, given the assaults he had supported as Premier from Alexander Grant MacKay, he was a piece of the administrative appointment that at long last arranged the exchange of asset control from the bureaucratic to the Alberta commonplace government in December 1929. A similar understanding exchanged asset rights to Saskatchewan and Manitoba. After it was marked yet before it produced results, Manitoba Premier John Bracken finished up a concurrence with the Winnipeg Electric Company, a private worry, to build up a hydroelectric dam at Seven Sisters' Reach. Since asset rights were as yet constrained by the national government, the arrangement required administrative endorsement. Stewart supported retention this endorsement in yielding to Manitoba popular supposition, which favored open responsibility for tasks, yet King regarded an arrangement of the asset exchange understanding that required the desires of common governments to be regarded until the exchange was finished and conceded endorsement. Stewart's inclination for open over private possession stretched out to King's arranged making of the Bank of Canada; Stewart needed the new foundation altogether under the control of the legislature, however King favored a course of action whereby half of its executives would be named by the administration and half by private investors and recommended that backers of open proprietorship may get themselves more at home in the communist Cooperative Commonwealth Federation than in his Liberal gathering. 

In spite of Stewart's contribution in exchanging asset rights to Alberta, his association with the UFA government that had crushed him in 1921 was chilly: Lakeland College history specialist Franklin Foster, in his memoir of UFA Premier John Edward Brownlee, claims that this animosity impacted Stewart's inclination for private enterprises over the Alberta government in conceding hydroelectric power grants. He additionally quarreled with then-Premier Brownlee over advancement in Alberta's national parks (Stewart supporting expansive scale private improvement and Brownlee restricting it), making King record in his journal "Brownlee strikes me as...being better than Mr. Stewart, who is disabled in his aversion of [Brownlee]." When King tried to ingest Progressives into his Liberal Party to frame a more grounded alliance against the Conservatives, Stewart contradicted collaboration with the UFA chiefs who made up an expansive piece of the Progressives' Albertan base. While King was slanted to see UFA legislators, similar to Progressives somewhere else, as "Dissidents in a rush" who were in a general sense alright with his administration and favored it to the Conservatives, Stewart comprehended that the UFA was a particular gathering whose individuals were in many regard more moderate than liberal. Lord rejected his priest's perspectives similar to the consequence of Stewart's caustic history with the UFA. 

Actually, Stewart did not make the most of King's certainty. In spite of the fact that he got him into his bureau 1921 to a limited extent at the asking of Progressive pioneer Thomas Crerar, King observed Stewart to be an insufficient defender of western interestsâparticularly in his backing of levy decrease, which King found drearyâand did not confide in his political guidance on the west. By 1925 he was thinking about naming Stewart to the Senate, to expel him from dynamic political association, yet was crippled by the nonappearance of some other Alberta portrayal in his bureau. In 1926 Stewart filled in as an emissary from King to enlist Saskatchewan Premier Charles Avery Dunning to the government bureau; the mission satisfied, King kept Stewart in bureau yet wrote in his journal that all issues relating to Alberta were to be "left to Dunning to do as he might suspect best". By 1927, King grumbled that Stewart had "no hold" on the territory of which he had once been Premier, and in 1930 he expressed "Association in Alberta is awful. Stewart is more awful than futile, resembles an elderly person, with no genuine control of circumstance." In the 1930 government decision Dunning and Crerar were both crushed; King grumbled that it was "superbly horrible to have Stewart alone speaking to the West." When Stewart also went down to overcome in 1935, King was satisfied "not to need to think about him" in gathering his new bureau, and selected rather to leave Alberta unrepresented to rebuff it for neglecting to choose any Liberals. 

After Stewart's annihilation in 1935, he was named by George V to seat the Canadian segment of the International Joint Commission, in acknowledgment of his ability on global water limit issues. In 1938, he was delegated seat of the Canadian area of the British Columbia â Yukon â Alaska Highway Commission. In these limits, he traversed Canada, visiting his child George at the family estate close Killam at each chance. He kicked the bucket December 6, 1946, leaving a domain of $21,961. 

Conceived in one of Canada's unique areas, Stewart moved west as a feature of an immense relocation to the prairies, and settled in Alberta the year it turned into a territory. As Alberta developed, Stewart played an undeniably critical political job in it, until he joined the central government to turn into Alberta's voice there, at last helping it accomplish sacred correspondence with the more seasoned areas by exchanging to its administration control of its assets. As Mackenzie King lauded him, "in a larger number of regards than one, Mr. Stewart's vocation reflected the advancement of Canada itself."
