Panther 2E 

The Leopard 2E or Leopard 2A6E ("E" means "EspaÃ±a", Spanish for Spain) is a variation of the German Leopard 2 fundamental fight tank, custom fitted to the necessities of the Spanish armed force, which obtained it as a component of a combat hardware modernization program named "Programa Coraza", or Program Breastplate. The procurement program for the LeopardÂ 2E started in 1994, five years after the dropping of the Lince tank program that finished in a consent to exchange 108 Leopard 2A4s to the Spanish armed force in 1998 and began the nearby creation of the Leopard 2E in December 2003. Regardless of deferment of creation attributable to the 2003 merger between Santa BÃ¡rbara Sistemas and General Dynamics, and proceeded with manufacture issues somewhere in the range of 2006 and 2007, 219 LeopardÂ 2Es have been conveyed to the Spanish armed force. 

The LeopardÂ 2E is a noteworthy improvement over the M60 Patton tank, which it supplanted in Spain's automated and defensively covered units. Its improvement spoke to a sum of 2.6Â million worker hours worth of work, 9,600 of them in Germany, at a complete expense of 2.4Â billion euros. This makes it a standout amongst the most costly Leopard 2s fabricated. Indigenous generation added up to 60% and the vehicles were collected locally at Sevilla by Santa BÃ¡rbara Sistemas. It has thicker covering on the turret and glacis plate than the German Leopard 2A6, and utilizes a Spanish-structured tank direction and control framework, like the one fitted in German Leopard 2s. The LeopardÂ 2E is relied upon to stay in administration until 2025. 

By 1987, the Spanish armed force was outfitted with 299 French-planned AMX-30Es, amassed by Santa BÃ¡rbara Sistemas, and 552 American M47 and M48 Patton tanks. The AMX-30Es were put into administration in 1970, while the last went into administration in the mid-1950s. Despite the fact that Spain's M47s and M48s were modernized to M47Es and M48Es, carrying them to close comparability with the M60 Patton tank, the Spanish armed force thought of them as old-fashioned. In 1984, when choosing to supplant its Patton tanks, the Spanish government announced its goal to create an entirely different fundamental fight tank locally, since known as the Lince. Five organizations communicated enthusiasm for offering, incorporating Krauss-Maffei in an association with Santa BÃ¡rbara Sistemas, GIAT with what turned into the Leclerc, General Dynamics with the M1 Abrams and Vickers with the Valiant. While the M1Â Abrams and Valiant offers were not acknowledged, the offering proceeded until 1989 when it was authoritatively dropped. 

Rather, the Spanish government selected to supplant its more seasoned Patton tanks with American M60 Patton tanks resigned from Central Europe as per the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. In spite of the fact that the Spanish armed force was initially to get 532 M60 and M60A1 tanks, just 260 M60A3s were at last conveyed, of which 244 were put into dynamic administration in the military. In the late 1980s the Spanish Ministry of Defense endorsed a modernization program for 150 of its AMX-30Es and a remaking program for the staying 149 vehicles of this sort, reestablishing them to their unique condition. Be that as it may, neither the M60s nor the AMX-30s were an impressive improvement over Spain's armada of M47 and M48 Patton tanks. 

Since the current tank armada did not address the Spanish armed force's issues, Spain opened converses with Germany and Krauss-Maffei over the likelihood of future joint effort concerning Spain's future tank, and sent a military appointment to Germany in 1994. Despite the fact that the Germans offered Spain surplus Leopard 1 tanks and Soviet gear fused into the German armed force after the reunification of Germany, the Spanish government declined these offers and squeezed for the Leopard 2. 

In March 1994, the Spanish Ministry of Defense made "Programa Coraza 2000" (Program Breastplate 2000), which concentrated on the acquisition and mix of new deadly implement for the Spanish armed force's modernization. The program incorporated the LeopardÂ 2E and the Pizarro infantry battle vehicle, just as the Eurocopter Tiger assault helicopter. The program's extension stretched out to the coordination of 108 LeopardÂ 2A4s, which were rented to Spain in late 1995. Aside from acquisition, "Programa Coraza" was intended to set up the Spanish armed force strategically for the presentation of new matÃ©riel. 

A reminder of comprehension was marked on 1995 between the German and Spanish governments, setting the establishments for a procurement of up to 308 fresh out of the plastic new LeopardÂ 2Es. These were to be gathered in Spain by Santa BÃ¡rbara Sistemas, with 60â 70 percent of the parts made by Spanish organizations, and creation occurring somewhere in the range of 1998 and 2003. Moreover, the German government consented to loan the Spanish armed force 108 for preparing purposes for a time of five years. These vehicles were conveyed between November 1995 and June 1996. In 1998, Spain consented to get the surrendered and decrease generation of the pristine LeopardÂ 2E to 219 vehicles. In 2005 it was announced that the 108 Leopard 2A4s were to cost Spain only â¬16.9m, to be paid by 2016. 

The prepared X and Infantry Brigade, which at the time framed piece of Eurocorps. As generation of the LeopardÂ 2E started and these units got Leopard 2Es, their LeopardÂ 2A4s re-prepared the "AlcÃ¡ntara" Armored Cavalry Regiment, situated in Melilla. 

Spain's LeopardÂ 2E depends on the Leopard 2A6, and fuses the extra wedge covering of the Leopard 2A5 on the turret. This reinforcement amplifies the covering profundity that an active vitality penetrator must make a trip through to enter the inner volume of the turret. Like the Swedish Leopard 2S (Strv 122), the LeopardÂ 2E has expanded defensive layer thickness on the body's glacis plate, the turret frontal curve and the turret rooftop, bringing the vehicle's weight near 63Â tonnes (69.4Â tons). The vehicle's security is enlarged by the additional protection that is incorporated with the tank amid the assembling procedure, rather than being included after get together just like the case for German LeopardÂ 2A5s and 2A6s. As an outcome, the LeopardÂ 2E is a standout amongst the best-ensured LeopardÂ 2s in administration. 

The tank is equipped with Rheinmetall's L/55 tank-weapon, and is fit for receiving a firearm. Both the tank authority and heavy armament specialist have indistinguishable second era warm watchers, got from those of the TOW 2B Light Launcher System. These are incorporated into the tank by Indra and Rheinmetall Defense Electronics. Indra gives the tank's order and control framework, called the Leopard Information and Command Equipment (LINCE), in view of the Swedish and German "Integrierte FÃ¼hrungssysteme" (IFIS). Different contrasts between the Spanish Leopard 2E and different LeopardÂ 2A6s incorporate a helper control unit, fabricated by SAPA, a cooling framework and new elastic cushions for the vehicle's tracks to build their life expectancy on the unpredictable Spanish landscape. About 60% of each LeopardÂ 2E was made in Spain, instead of 30% for the Swedish LeopardÂ 2S, for instance. 

In spite of the fact that the last contract for the creation of Spanish LeopardÂ 2Es was marked in 1998, requiring a generation rate of four tanks for every month, the first LeopardÂ 2Es were not produced until late 2003. This was to a great extent because of the converging of Santa BÃ¡rbara Sistemas with General Dynamics, and Krauss-Maffei's reservations in regards to the sharing of the LeopardÂ 2's innovation with an opponent organization maker of the M1 Abrams. Krauss-Maffei conveyed 30 LeopardÂ 2Es somewhere in the range of 2003 and 2006. Generation by Santa BÃ¡rbara Sistemas was deferred after gathering had started; among January and November 2007, for instance, just three of the 43 LeopardÂ 2Es to be conveyed to the Spanish armed force were really conveyedâwith 15 all the more being conveyed before the year's end to compensate for the prior creation issues. By 1Â July 2006 the Spanish armed force had gotten 48 LeopardÂ 2Es and nine BÃ¼ffel defensively covered recuperation vehicles, which was just a fourth of those contracted. Generation of the Leopard 2E was wanted to finish by 2007 however was stretched out into 2008. 

The LeopardÂ 2E supplanted the LeopardÂ 2A4 in Spanish automated units, which thus supplanted M60s in mounted force units. The two adaptations of the Leopard 2 are relied upon to stay in administration with the Spanish armed force until 2025. As far as modern scale, the creation and advancement of the LeopardÂ 2E speaks to an aggregate of 2.6Â million worker hours of work, incorporating 9,600 in Germany. It is a standout amongst the most costly Leopard 2s constructed; the first contract was worth â¬1,910m however the last expense was â¬2,399m. 

The Spanish armed force supplanted its M60Â Patton tanks and AMX-30s with the LeopardÂ 2 somewhere in the range of 1995 and 2008, an extensive improvement in capacity. Already, the Spanish armed force was furnished with M47 and M48Â Patton tanks, which were moved up to close M60 equivalency amid the late 1970s and amid the 1980s. Both the LeopardÂ 2A4 and LeopardÂ 2E sport a substantially more dominant weapon than the AMX-30 and M60 tanks. The Leopard 2's 1,500Â horsepower (1,110Â kW) motor gives more noteworthy power than the M60A3's 750Â horsepower (559.27Â kW) and the AMX-30EM2's 850Â horsepower (633.84Â kW) motors. Then again, the LeopardÂ 2 conveys less, yet bigger rounds than the M60A3.
