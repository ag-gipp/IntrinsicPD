A Song Flung Up to Heaven is the 6th book in writer Maya Angelou's arrangement of life accounts. Set somewhere in the range of 1965 and 1968, it starts where Angelou's past book "Every one of God's Children Need Traveling Shoes" closes, with Angelou's outing from Accra, Ghana, where she had lived for as far back as four years, back to the United States. Two "catastrophic occasions" outline the start and end of the bookâthe deaths of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. Angelou portrays how she managed these occasions and the major developments in both the nation and in her own life, and how she adapted to her arrival home. The book closes with Angelou at "the limit of her abstract vocation", composing the opening lines to her first self-portrayal, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings". 

As she had done in "Confined Bird", and proceeded all through her arrangement, Angelou maintained the long convention of African-American collection of memoirs. In the meantime she made an intentional endeavor to challenge the typical structure of the personal history by scrutinizing, changing, and extending the class. Most analysts concurred that the book was comprised of a progression of vignettes. When "Tune" was written in 2002, sixteen years after her past personal history, Angelou had encountered incredible distinction and acknowledgment as a writer and artist. She discussed her ballad "On the Pulse of Morning" at the initiation of President Bill Clinton in 1993, turning into the principal writer to make a debut recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's in 1961. She had turned out to be perceived and profoundly regarded as a representative for Blacks and ladies. Angelou was, as researcher Joanne Braxton has expressed, "without a doubt,Â ... America's most obvious dark lady autobiographer". She had additionally progressed toward becoming, as commentator Richard Long expressed, "a noteworthy personal voice of the time". 

The title of "Tune" depended on a similar ballad, by African-American artist Paul Lawrence Dunbar, the premise of her first personal history. Like Angelou's different collections of memoirs, the book was welcomed with both applause and dissatisfaction, in spite of the fact that surveys were commonly positive. Analysts lauded Angelou for "the climax of an extraordinary personal accomplishment", while others censured her for seeming to be "priggish". The 2002 verbally expressed word collection by a similar name, in view of the book, got a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2003. 

"A Song Flung Up to Heaven" (2002) is the 6th of Maya Angelou's arrangement of collections of memoirs, and at the season of its distribution it was viewed as the last portion. It was finished 16 years after the distribution of her past collection of memoirs, "Every one of God's Children Need Traveling Shoes" (1986) and more than thirty years after the production of her first, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings". Angelou composed two accumulations of expositions then, "Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now" (1993) and "Even the Stars Look Lonesome" (1997), which essayist Hilton Als called her "knowledge books" and "instructions hung together with personal writings". She additionally proceeded with her verse with a few volumes, including an accumulation of her ballads, "The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou" (1994). In 1993, Angelou discussed her sonnet "On the Pulse of Morning" at the initiation of President Bill Clinton, turning into the main artist to make a debut recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's initiation in 1961. Her recitation brought about more notoriety and acknowledgment for her past works, and widened her allure "crosswise over racial, financial, and instructive limits". 

By 2002, when "Melody" was distributed, Angelou had turned out to be perceived and very regarded as a representative for Blacks and ladies. She was, as researcher Joanne Braxton has expressed, "without a doubt,Â ... America's most noticeable dark lady autobiographer". She had additionally turned into "a noteworthy self-portraying voice of the time". Angelou was one of the primary African-American female authors to openly talk about her own life, and one of the first to utilize herself as a focal character in her books. Essayist Julian Mayfield, who called her first collection of memoirs "a show-stopper that escapes portrayal", expressed that Angelou's arrangement set a point of reference for other Black ladies journalists, however for the class of personal history all in all. 

Als called Angelou one of the "pioneers of self-presentation", willing to concentrate sincerely on the more contrary parts of her identity and decisions. For instance, while Angelou was making her second self-portrayal, "Assemble in My Name", she was worried about how her perusers would respond to her exposure that she had been a whore. Her significant other Paul Du Feu convinced her to distribute the book by urging her to "come clean as an author" and to "speak the truth about it". "Melody" took 16 years to compose on the grounds that it was so agonizing for her to remember the occasions she portrayed, including the deaths of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. She didn't commend her birthday, April 4, for a long time since it was likewise the commemoration of King's demise, picking rather to send his widow Coretta Scott King blossoms. Despite the fact that "Melody" was viewed as the last portion in her arrangement of personal histories, Angelou kept expounding on her biography through papers, and at 85 years old, distributed her seventh life account "Mother and Me and Mom" (2013), which concentrated on her association with her mom. The expressed word collection dependent on "Tune" and described by Angelou got a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2003. 

Angelou came back to a similar sonnet she based the title of "Confined Bird" upon for the title of "A Song Flung Up to Heaven," from the third stanza of the Paul Laurence Dunbar lyric "Compassion". Alongside Shakespeare, Angelou has acknowledged Dunbar for shaping her "composing desire". The confined feathered creature, an image for the fastened slave, is a picture Angelou utilizes all through the entirety of her compositions. 

I know why the confined flying creature sings, ah me,When his wing is wounded and his chest sore,When he pulsates his bars and would be free;It isn't a ditty of satisfaction or glee,But a supplication that he sends from his heart's profound core,But a request, that upward to Heaven he throwsâI know why the confined fowl sings. 

"A Song Flung Up to Heaven", which happens somewhere in the range of 1965 and 1968, gets where Angelou's past book, "Every one of God's Children Need Traveling Shoes", closes, with Angelou's plane outing from Accra, Ghana, where she has gone through the past four years, back to the United States. Two "catastrophic occasions" outline the start and end of the bookâthe deaths of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. Her nineteen-year-old child Guy has turned into a grown-up and is going to school in Ghana, and she is leaving a controlling relationshipâher "sentimental other", whom she depicted as "an incredible West African man who had cleared into my existence with the earnestness of a Southern sea tempest". She had likewise been welcome to come back to the US by Malcolm X, whom she had moved toward becoming companions with amid his visit to Accra, to enable her to make the Organization of African Unity. 

She defers meeting with Malcolm X for a month and visits her mom and sibling in San Francisco. Malcolm X is killed two days after the fact. Crushed and sorrow stricken, she moves to Hawaii to be close to her sibling and to continue her singing and performing vocation, which she had surrendered before leaving for Africa quite a while prior. She understands, in the wake of seeing Della Reese play out, that she comes up short on the craving, duty, and ability to be an artist. She rather comes back to her composition profession, however this time in Los Angeles rather than in New York City as she had before in her life. To procure additional cash, Angelou turns into an economic analyst in Watts and becomes more acquainted with the area and its kin. She observes the 1965 Watts Riots, realizing that doing as such could prompt her capture, and she is truly frustrated that it doesn't. 

At a certain point, Angelou's sweetheart from Ghana, whom she calls "the African", lands in Los Angeles to return her to Accra. Angelou enrolls the guide of her mom and sibling; they act the hero by and by redirecting the African first to Mexico and after that back to Ghana. Fellow, amid a visit to his grandma in San Francisco, gets into another fender bender, like what occurred before he started school in Ghana. His development is striking to his mom, and she abandons him being taken care of by his grandma. 

Angelou comes back to New York, where she commits herself to her composition and restores huge numbers of the kinships made there before. She additionally portrays her own and expert associations with Ruby Dee, Ossie Davis, Beah Richards, and Frank Silvera. Martin Luther King, Jr. requests that her movement around the nation advancing the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She concurs, however "defers once more", and he is killed on her 40th birthday celebration. Again crushed, she disengages herself until welcome to an evening gathering likewise gone to by her companion James Baldwin and illustrator Jules Feiffer and his better half Judy. Judy Feiffer, roused by her stories about Angelou's adolescence, contacts supervisor Robert Loomis, who challenges Angelou to keep in touch with her collection of memoirs as writing. She acknowledges his test, and "Tune" closes with Angelou at "the edge of her abstract profession", composing the opening lines to her first life account, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings": 

"What are you taking a gander at me for. I didn't come to remain". 

Beginning with "Confined Bird", Angelou made a purposeful endeavor while composing every one of her collections of memoirs, including "Tune", to challenge the standard structure of the personal history by investigating, changing, and extending the class. Her utilization of fiction-composing systems, for example, exchange, portrayal, and topical improvement has regularly driven commentators to classify her books as personal fiction. Angelou expressed in a 1989 meeting that she was the main "genuine" essayist to pick the class to convey what needs be. As pundit Susan Gilbert expressed, Angelou was revealing not one individual's story, however the collective's. Researcher Selwyn R. Cudjoe concurred, and saw Angelou as illustrative of the tradition in African-American collection of memoirs as an open motion that represented a whole gathering of individuals. Angelou's editorial manager Robert Loomis had the capacity to set out her into stating "Confined Bird" by moving her to compose a collection of memoirs that could be considered "high craftsmanship", which she proceeded all through her arrangement, including her last self-portrayal. 

Angelou's personal histories fit in with the class' standard structure: they were composed by a solitary creator, they were sequential, and they contained components of character, strategy, and subject. In a 1983 meeting with African-American writing pundit Claudia Tate, Angelou called her books collections of memoirs. When discussing her extraordinary utilization of the class, Angelou recognized that she has pursued the slave account convention of "talking in the primary individual solitary discussing the principal individual plural, continually saying I signifying 'we'". Analyst Elsie B. Washington concurred, and expressed that "A Song Flung Up to Heaven" "offers a look into the life of a scholarly symbol really taking shape" affected by chronicled occasions and identities, for example, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., and James Baldwin. 

Angelou perceived that there were anecdotal perspectives to every one of her books; she tended to "veer from the ordinary thought of self-portrayal as truth". Her methodology paralleled the traditions of numerous African-American collections of memoirs composed amid the abolitionist time frame in the US, when truth was frequently controlled for reasons for self-insurance. Creator Lyman B. Hagen has set Angelou in the long custom of African-American life account, however demanded that she has made an interesting understanding of the personal structure. In a 1998 meeting with columnist George Plimpton, Angelou talked about her composition procedure, and "the occasionally tricky thought of truth in genuine" and journals. Whenever inquired as to whether she changed reality to improve her story, she expressed, "Here and there I make a distance across from a composite of three or four individuals, on the grounds that the substance in just a single individual isn't adequately solid to be expounded on." Although Angelou has never confessed to changing the actualities in her accounts, she has utilized these certainties to have an effect with the peruser. As Hagen expressed, "One can accept that 'the embodiment of the information' is available in Angelou's work". Hagen additionally expressed that Angelou "fictionalizes, to upgrade intrigue". Angelou's long-term supervisor, Robert Loomis, concurred, expressing that she could revamp any of her books by changing the request of her realities to have an alternate effect on the peruser. 

Like Angelou's past collections of memoirs, "Melody" got generally constructive surveys, in spite of the fact that as the Poetry Foundation has stated: "Most faultfinders have passed judgment on Angelou's consequent life accounts in light of her first, and "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" remains the most profoundly commended." Kim Hubbard of "Individuals Magazine", for instance, discovered "Tune" uninspiring and "hurriedly gathered", yet idyllic like "Confined Bird". Numerous commentators acknowledged what "Kirkus Reviews" called Angelou's "decent basic turn" of encircling "Melody" with two deaths. Paula Friedman of "The New York Times Book Review" valued Angelou's "events of basic self-appraisal and humility" not present in numerous different collections of memoirs. Patricia Elam of "The New Crisis" concurred, expressing that there is a lot to appreciate both about the book and about the "vast life", brimming with pressure, chuckling, and love, it depicts. Elam additionally called "Melody" "a soul moving work that depicts Angelou's adventure through a real and creative life". 

Commentator Margaret Busby, who saw this book "less a consummation but rather more a start", called "Tune" "the zenith of a remarkable personal accomplishment, a sublime festival of dauntless soul". Like different analysts, Busby considered "Melody" a progression of "wonderfully made vignettes" and found the book compact and lucid. Researcher John McWhorter did not take a gander at Angelou's utilization of vignettes as decidedly, and expressed that every last bit of her books were short, isolated into "ever shorter" sections as her arrangement advanced, and "some of the time appear to be composed for youngsters instead of grown-ups". McWhorter perceived, in any case, that Angelou's exact writing and "striking and notwithstanding shaking straightforwardness" was because of Angelou's motivations of delineating African-American culture emphatically. Busby additionally perceived Angelou's capacity to discover persuasive exercises from difficulty, both broadly and actually, in spite of the fact that the accentuation in this book was on the individual, particularly her problems as a mother and as a sweetheart. 

Amy Strong of "The Library Journal", maybe in light of the fact that Angelou's life amid the time the book occurred was loaded with more close to home misfortune than strife and battle, considered "Tune" less significant and extraordinary than the past books in Angelou's arrangement. She anticipated that "Song"â²s immediate and candid style would be prevalent. "Distributers Weekly", in its survey of the book, concurred with Strong and saw "a specific renunciation" in "Melody", rather than "the combativeness" in Angelou's different collections of memoirs. The commentator additionally expressed that the individuals who survived the time Angelou portrayed would value her appraisal of it, and that "Melody" was "an account of disaster and triumph, all around expressed and unmistakably stepped by her own exceptional mix of Afro-Americanism". The deaths in "Melody" furnished the book with profundity as Angelou portrayed a mind-blowing occasions, which would be "minor meanderings" whenever depicted by a less talented essayist. The analyst had the capacity to see Angelou's "generous soul" and found the book "fulfilling", in spite of the fact that he thought of it as an "occasionally level record" that did not have "the otherworldly tone of Angelou's articles, the transparency of her verse and the dramatization of her different life accounts". 

Both McWhorter and researcher Hilton Als discovered Angelou's composition all through her arrangement vainglorious. Despite the fact that McWhorter has confessed to being enchanted by Angelou's feeling of power she has embedded into her works, which he calls her "dark mother mind", he considered Angelou's collections of memoirs after "Confined Bird" "conceited", and has expressed that she "verifiably challenges the peruser to scrutinize her private line to God and Truth". Als concurred, expressing what made "Melody" not quite the same as her first volumes is her "regularly expanding lack of quality". Als expressed that Angelou, in her six collections of memoirs, "has given usÂ ... the overconfident, natively constructed, and here and there strangely pretentious story of a dark lady who, when looked with the preliminaries of life, essentially manages". Als trusted that Angelou's papers, written during the 1990s, were a superior finish of her work as an autobiographer.
