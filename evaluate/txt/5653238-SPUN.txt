PowerBook 100 

The PowerBookÂ 100 is a versatile subnotebook PC that was planned and produced by Sony for Apple Computer and presented on October 21, 1991, at the COMDEX PC expo in Las Vegas, Nevada. Valued at US$2,300, the PowerBookÂ 100 was the low-end model of the initial three all the while discharged PowerBooks. Its CPU and by and large speed intently took after those of its ancestor, the Macintosh Portable. It had a Motorola 68000 16-megahertz (MHz) processor, 2-8Â megabytes (MB) of memory, a monochrome illuminated fluid gem show (LCD) with 640Â ÃÂ 400Â pixel goals, and the System 7.0.1 working framework. It didn't have a worked in floppy circle drive and was noted for its interesting minimized structure that put a trackball pointing gadget before the console for convenience. 

Apple's then (CEO) John Sculley began the PowerBook venture in 1990, designating $1Â million for promoting. In spite of the little advertising spending plan, the new PowerBook line was a triumph, creating over $1Â billion in income for Apple in its first year. Sony structured and produced the PowerBookÂ 100 as a team with the Apple Industrial Design Group, Apple's interior plan group. It was ceased on September 3, 1992, and supplanted by the PowerBook 145 and PowerBook Duo arrangement. From that point forward, it has been adulated a few times for its structure; "PC World" named the PowerBookÂ 100 the tenth-most prominent PC ever in 2006, and US magazine "Portable PC" picked the PowerBookÂ 100 as the best contraption ever in 2005. 

From 1990, John Sculley, at that point CEO of Apple, administered item improvement by and by to guarantee that Apple discharged new PCs to showcase all the more rapidly. His new technique was to expand piece of the pie by bringing down costs and discharging more "hit" items. This methodology added to the business accomplishment of the low-end Macintosh Classic and Macintosh LC, work stations discharged by Apple in 1990. Sculley needed to repeat the achievement of these items with Apple's new PowerBook line. 

Sculley started the venture in 1990 and needed the PowerBook to be discharged inside one year. The undertaking had three directors: John Medica, who oversaw designing for the new PC; Randy Battat, who was the VP for item advertising; and Neil Selvin, who headed the showcasing exertion. In 1991, the two heads in the PC were Toshiba and Compaq, the two of which had presented models weighing not exactly . Medica, Battat, and Selvin intentionally structured the PowerBook to weigh not as much as its rivals. 

Sculley allotted a $1Â million promoting spending plan to the PowerBook product offering, rather than the $25Â million used to advertise the Macintosh Classic. Medica, Battat, and Selvin utilized a large portion of the cash to create and air a TV plug that watchers would recollect. Publicizing organization Chiat/Day shot resigned Los Angeles Lakers ball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sitting awkwardly in a little aircraft mentor situate yet easily composing on his PowerBook. The advertisement inscription read: "In any event his hands are agreeable." 

Mac revealed the PowerBookÂ 100 on October 21, 1991, at the Comdex PC expo in Las Vegas, with two different models, the PowerBook 140 and PowerBook 170. The notice and the item were both effective. Apple anticipated US offers of more than 200,000 PowerBooks in the principal year, with pinnacle request in the initial three months of discharge. By January 1992, Apple had sold more than 100,000 PowerBooks, by which time they were hard to come by. Apple before long tackled the supply issues, and the returns from PowerBook deals achieved $1Â billion in the primary year after dispatch. Macintosh outperformed Toshiba and Compaq as the market head in overall offer of compact PC shipments. The PowerBookÂ 100, 140, and 170 contributed incredibly to Apple's money related achievement in 1992. Toward the finish of the money related year, Apple reported its most elevated figures yet, $7.1Â billion in incomes and an expansion in worldwide piece of the pie from 8% to 8.5%, the most elevated it had been in four years. 

In any case, the underlying ubiquity of the PowerBookÂ 100 did not last. Deals diminished, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had turned out to be increasingly well known on the grounds that clients were eager to pay more for an inherent floppy circle drive and second sequential port, which the PowerBookÂ 100 needed. By August 10, 1992, Apple unobtrusively dropped the PowerBookÂ 100 from its value list yet kept on selling existing stock through its own vendors and elective markdown customer arranged stores, for example, Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard drive design with a floppy drive sold for under $1,000 (more than $1,500 not exactly the comparative 2MB/20MB setup's unique rundown cost). 

On September 17, 1992, Apple reviewed 60,000 PowerBookÂ 100s due to a potential wellbeing issue. An electrical short, it was found, could dissolve a little gap in the packaging, which happened in three of the 60,000 note pads fabricated between October 1991 and March 1992. Upon the arrival of the review, Apple shares shut at $47, down $1.25, however a few examiners limited the review's significance. Likewise, the first power supplies had issues with protection splits that could cause a short in a circuit on the motherboard; and the PC was inclined to breaks in the power connector attachment on the motherboard, which required a $400 substitution motherboard if the guarantee had lapsed. 

The vast majority of the PowerBookÂ 100's inner parts depended on its forerunner, the Macintosh Portable. It incorporated a Motorola 68HC000 16Â MHz processor, had 2Â MB memory, no floppy plate drive, and cost roughly $2,300. An outside floppy plate drive was accessible for $279. The elements of the PowerBookÂ 100 were an improvement over the Portable. It was profound, wide, and high, contrasted with the Portable, which was profound, wide and high. Another huge contrast was the more affordable uninvolved grid show utilized rather than the more keen dynamic lattice utilized on the Portable (and the 170). The PowerBookÂ 100 incorporated the System 7.0.1 working framework as standard, with help for all variants up to System 7.5.5. Apple, in any case, discharged System 6.0.8L, which enabled the PowerBookÂ 100 to run System 6. It could likewise be utilized with some before SystemÂ 6 forms, despite the fact that Apple did not authoritatively bolster this. 

The PowerBookÂ 100 had one outer sequential port, intended for use with a printer or any good RS-422 gadget. It was the primary Macintosh to exclude an outside modem port, rather offering a discretionary inherent 2400 baud modem for interchanges. Thus, out of the blue a client couldn't print legitimately and get to AppleTalk or a quicker outer modem all the while, and gadgets, for example, propelled MIDI interfaces couldn't be utilized in light of the fact that they required the committed utilization of the two ports. An outsider sequential modem port could, notwithstanding, be introduced in the inward modem opening for buyers who required customary capacities. 

At the point when the PC was not being used, substance of the memory were protected as long as the principle lead-corrosive battery stayed charged. The PowerBookÂ 100 Power Manager was a coordinated circuit, normally set on the rationale leading body of a PowerBook, and was in charge of the power the executives of the PC. Indistinguishable to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the showcase's backdrop illumination, hard drive turn down, rest and wake, battery charging, trackball control, and info/yield (I/O). The 100 added another element: 3.5Â V batteries sponsored up lasting and extension irregular access memory (RAM) when the PowerBookÂ 100's battery was being supplanted or when the 100 was generally briefly expelled from all power sources. This made it an ideal possibility for use with Apple's RAM circle to help increment battery life by getting to the hard plate less much of the time, since the 100 was the main PowerBook that kept up the substance of RAM on shutdown so as to decrease startup time. 

The PowerBookÂ 100 was the first PowerBook to fuse SCSI Disk Mode, which enabled it to be utilized as an outside hard circle on a work area Macintosh. This gave an advantageous technique to programming to be introduced onto the PowerBook or exchanged to the work area, without the requirement for the 100's discretionary floppy plate drive. A specific SCSI link with a one of a kind connector was required, in any case, to utilize any SCSI gadget on the PowerBook arrangement. A second committed link was required for SCSI Disk Mode. This element was remarkable to the 100 until Apple presented new PowerBooks over a year later. 

There are two forms of the PowerBookÂ 100's QWERTY design console: a household US adaptation with 63Â keys and a global ISO variant with 64Â keys. The tops lock key on the PowerBookÂ 100 did not have a locking position or a lit marker of its status, and to redress, the SystemÂ 7 working framework programming incorporates an expansion record that causes a symbol of the global tops lock image (âª) to show up in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar when Caps Lock is dynamic. 

Both the PowerBookÂ 140 and 170 were planned before the 100 by the Apple Industrial Design Group, from March 1990-February 1991. The 100's styling depended on those PCs and speaks to the primary upgrades to the PowerBook line as Apple profited by the exercises learned in building up the more dominant models' walled in area. The 100 was planned among September and December 1990, and held a similar structure components, which were a minor departure from the Snow White plan language Apple had been utilizing since 1984. In particular, raised edges dispersed separated proposed to integrate it with the current product offering. 

Apple drew closer Sony in late 1989 in light of the fact that it didn't have enough architects to deal with the quantity of new items that were made arrangements for conveyance in 1991. Utilizing a fundamental plan from Apple, including a rundown of chips and different parts, and the Portable's engineering, the 100 was scaled down and made by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony engineers had little experience building PCs however in any case finished Apple's littlest and lightest machine in under 13Â months, dropping different undertakings and giving the PowerBookÂ 100 top need. Sony president Norio Ohga gave venture administrator Kihey Yamamoto authorization to select architects from any Sony division. 

Robert Brunner, Apple's head of mechanical plan at the time, drove the structure group that built up the workstation, including its trackball and stone shading. Brunner said he planned the PowerBook "so it would be as simple to utilize and convey as an ordinary book". The dull stone dim shading set it apart from other scratch pad PCs of the time and furthermore from Apple's different items, which generally were beige or platinum dim. The trackball, another new structure component, was set amidst the PC, enabling the PowerBook to be effectively worked by both left-and right-gave clients. The architects were attempting to make a style explanation with the general structure of the workstation, which they felt made it an increasingly close to home frill, similar to a wallet or folder case. Brunner stated: "It says something regarding the personality of the individual who is conveying it". 

Gem Waters of "Home Office Computing" applauded the PowerBookÂ 100's "novel, successful plan" however was baffled in light of the fact that the interior modem did not get faxes, and the 100 had no screen port. The low-limit 20Â MB hard drive was additionally reprimanded. When a client's center applications had been introduced, little room was left for discretionary projects and records. Waters finished up: "Having utilized the 100 continually in the previous couple of weeks, I realize I wouldn't feel deceived by getting it - if just it had a 40MBÂ hard-circle drive choice." 

"PC Week" benchmarked the PowerBookÂ 100, estimating it against its ancestor, the Macintosh Portable. The PowerBookÂ 100 took 5.3Â seconds to open a Microsoft Word report and 2.5Â seconds to spare it. The Portable took 5.4 and 2.6Â seconds individually. "PC Week" tried the battery life, which conveyed 3Â hours 47Â minutes of utilization. "Byte magazine"s audit finished up, "The PowerBookÂ 100 is prescribed for word handling and interchanges assignments; the higher-final results offer enough power for complex reports, huge spreadsheets and expert illustrations." "MacWEEK" portrayed it as "perfect for scholars and others on a tight spending plan." 

The PowerBookÂ 100 keeps on accepting acknowledgment from the press. "PC World" named the PowerBookÂ 100 the tenth most prominent PC ever in 2006, and in 2005, US magazine "Versatile PC" picked the PowerBookÂ 100 as the best device ever, in front of the Sony Walkman and Atari 2600. The PowerBookÂ 100 got different honors for its plan, including the 1999 IDSA Silver Design of the Decade Award, "Structure" magazine's 1993 Designer's Design Awards, the 1992 ISDA Gold Industrial Design Excellence Award, the 1992 Appliance Manufacturer Excellence in Design grant, and the Industry Forum Design 10 Best - Hannover Fair honor.
