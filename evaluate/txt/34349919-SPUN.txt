The amusement takes the player in an undertaking through an arbitrarily created world.

"Flotilla" is a three-dimensional concurrent turn-based system space battle computer game set in an arbitrarily produced universe. The player and PC controlled adversaries issue requests to their boats, which are conveyed in a concurrent and ongoing style over a time of 30 seconds. The amusement at that point solidifies, and the player and adversaries issue new requests to their boats, which are again performed for 30 seconds. This procedure rehashes until one gathering is crushed. Requests are isolated into three gatherings: assault move, flank move and center flame.

Every planet offers a conceivable mission or challenge to the player. Difficulties are strategic fights in which the player must battle against an assortment of adversaries. In any case, boats must be hurt from behind or beneath; assaults from some other position will be countered by the boats' shields. After succeeding, another section is added to the player's character's story, and the player is compensated with ship overhauls. These overhauls are utilized to redo ships with upgrades, for example, expanded terminating speed or heavier back protection. The updates accessible to the player after completing each experience with an adversary can change, so the player may not get a similar redesign by playing a similar experience in two distinct undertakings. "Flotilla" has agreeable and part screen multiplayer modes that can be played with an extra Xbox 360 controller.
