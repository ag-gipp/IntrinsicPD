The 2003 Cricket World Cup was the eighth World Cup, sorted out by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The challenge occurred between 9 February and 23 March 2003, enduring 43 days. Co-facilitated by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya, the competition was the principal World Cup to be played in Africa. There were 14 taking an interest groups, the biggest number in a World Cup up to that point. Just as the 10 Test-playing countries, four partner groups participated. Kenya, by temperance of its ODI status, naturally met all requirements for the competition; Canada, Namibia and Netherlandsâthe main three groups of the 2001 ICC Trophyâshaped the rest. 

The structure of the competition was like that of the 1999 World Cup. The 14 nations were isolated into two gatherings of seven; each group played the others in its gathering once. The best three from each gathering fit the bill for the Super Sixes stage, an arrangement which was presented in the 1999 competition.
