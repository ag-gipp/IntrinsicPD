Some portion of the original raised under French colonization, Rabearivelo grew up ruined and neglected to finish auxiliary instruction. His energy for French writing and conventional Malagasy verse provoked him to peruse broadly and instruct himself on an assortment of subjects, including the French language and its beautiful and exposition customs. He distributed his first sonnets as an immature in nearby artistic audits, before long getting work at a distributing house where he functioned as an editor and editorial manager of its scholarly diaries. He distributed various verse collections in French and Malagasy, just as scholarly studies, a musical show, and two books. 

Rabearivelo's initial time of innovator propelled verse indicated expertise and pulled in basic consideration yet clung carefully to customary classification traditions. The surrealist verse he made start in 1931 showed more noteworthy innovation, earning him solid applause and approval. In spite of expanding basic consideration in worldwide verse audits, Rabearivelo was never managed access to the tip top groups of friends of pilgrim Madagascar. He endured a progression of individual and expert dissatisfactions, including the passing of his girl, the French specialists' choice to reject him from the rundown of exhibitors at the Universal Exposition in Paris, and developing obligation compounded by his philandering and opium enslavement. Following Rabearivelo's suicide by cyanide harming in 1937, he moved toward becoming seen as a pioneer saint.

The Government of Madagascar proclaimed Rabearivelo its national artist upon freedom in 1960.

At the point when the French colonized Madagascar in 1897, Merina nobles including Rabearivelo's mom lost the benefits, eminence, and riches to which they had been entitled under the previous government, the Kingdom of Imerina. Madagascar had been a French state for not exactly 10 years when Rabearivelo was conceived, arranging him among the original of Malagasy to grow up under the pilgrim framework. He originally learned at the FrÃ¨res des Ãcoles ChrÃ©tiennes school in the well-off neighborhood of Andohalo, at that point exchanged to the esteemed CollÃ¨ge Saint-Michel, where he was ousted for absence of order, poor scholastic execution, and his hesitance to turn out to be religiously attentive. He finished his investigations at Ãcole Flacourt in 1915. He is accepted to have distributed his first ballads at age 14 in the artistic survey "Vakio Ity" under the nom de plume K. Verbal. 

Subsequent to leaving school, he worked an assortment of low-talented employments, including as a ribbon creator, an errand kid, and a secretary and translator to a locale head. Amid this period he built up an enthusiasm for French nineteenth and twentieth century writing and refined his familiarity with the French language; he likewise started showing himself English, Spanish, and Hebrew. He changed his name to Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo to have indistinguishable initials from Jean-Jacques Rousseau, while proceeding to infrequently utilize nom de plumes, "Amance Valmond" and "Jean OsmÃ©". He was especially pulled in to artists and scholars who were pariahs in their very own general public, including Baudelaire and Rimbaud. 

In 1920, Rabearivelo was enlisted as an associate curator at the "Cercle de l'Union" social club. That equivalent year he drafted his first book, a short novel written in the Malagasy language. He started to compare with a wide scope of journalists around the globe, including AndrÃ© Gide, Paul ValÃ©ry, Jean Amrouche, Paul Claudel, and Valery Larbaud, and spent extensive wholes to purchase books and ship them to Madagascar. By these methods he amassed a differing gathering that comprised the most extravagant library on the island. In 1924 he accepted a position as an editor at the distributing house Imprimerie de l'Imerina, a position he would keep on possessing for an incredible remainder. In 1921 he got to know abnormal state French pilgrim civil servants who shared his energy for French writing, including Robert Boudry, the settlement's money related administrator, and Pierre Camo, Madagascar's postal officer and originator of the scholarly magazine "18Â° Latitude Sud". 

He distributed his first gathering of sonnets, "La car de cendres" ("The Cup of Ashes") in 1924; that year he likewise deciphered twelve beforehand unpublished Malagasy language lyrics into French and distributed them in abstract magazines, including "18Â° Latitude Sud" in Antananarivo and "La Vie" in Paris. This production propelled him into the scholarly and social circles of Antananarivo high society, where he built up himself as Madagascar's pioneer in verse and composition, however as a regarded columnist, workmanship faultfinder, interpreter, and author of articles and plays. 

In 1925 he distributed a verifiable novel called "L'Aube Rouge" ("The Red Dawn") about the most recent long stretches of the Kingdom of Imerina. In it he regarded Rainandriamampandry, the legislative head of Toamasina who was executed by the French in 1896 for his presumed job in the Menalamba defiance. Rabearivelo distributed his second and third verse collections, "Sylves" ("Woodlands") and "Volumes", in 1927 and 1928 separately. He likewise distributed his second authentic novel in 1928, "L'interfÃ©rence" ("Interference"), which portrays the life of an honorable family from the most recent long periods of the government until colonization. All through the 1920s, he deciphered crafted by remote artists and essayists into Malagasy, including Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Laforgue, Rilke, Whitman, and GÃ³ngora; he additionally interpreted conventional Malagasy "kabary" (rhetoric) into French for production in French-language scholarly surveys. 

In 1926, Rabearivelo wedded Mary Razafitrimo, the little girl of a nearby picture taker, and together they had five youngsters. He was additionally a womanizer and manhandled liquor and opium, becoming progressively subject to the substances after the demise of his girl. Rabearivelo continually battled with obligation, and in spite of his developing popularity and imaginative achievement, he was unfit to escape from destitution. 

All through the 1930s, Rabearivelo united with other Malagasy artists and journalists in a developing scholarly development named ""Hitady ny Very"" ("The Search for Lost Values"), which looked to advance the conventional abstract and oral crafts of Madagascar. Together with individual specialists Charles Rajoelisolo and Ny Avana Ramanantoanina, in August 1931 he established an abstract diary called "Ny Fandrosoam-baovao" ("New Progress") to advance Malagasy-language verse. He distributed two additional treasurys of thirty sonnets every: "Presque-Songes" ("Dream Images") (1931) and "Traduit de la nuit" ("Translated from the Night") (1932). As a test, he composed Malagasy and French variants of every lyric in these two books; the French forms were distributed in 1934 and 1935 separately. For an amazing rest he concentrated fundamentally on the interpretation of "hainteny" (conventional Malagasy verse) into French, work which was distributed after death. He likewise composed Madagascar's sole musical drama, "Imaitsoanala" (1935), named for the amazing courageous woman mother of King Ralambo; it was set to music created by Andrianary Ratianarivo and was performed by Ratianarivo's Troupe Jeanette at the Municipal Theater of Isotry in Antananarivo. 

In 1933, his three-year-old little girl Voahangy turned out to be sick and passed on. Rabearivelo was profoundly influenced by this misfortune and was dove into pain from which he never recouped. His last little girl, who was conceived in 1936, he named Velomboahangy ("Voahangy Alive"). The subject of death ended up noticeable and repetitive in his works and diary. 

The pioneer high society of Antananarivo exhibited Rabearivelo's work as proof of the accomplishment of the French absorption arrangement and the gainful impacts of expansionism in Africa. In his diaries, the artist composed that he felt "utilized" by the French experts in Madagascar. Representative MontagnÃ© granted him an alliance ("membre correspondant") with the "AcadÃ©mie Malgache" in 1932. Be that as it may, in 1937, Rabearivelo's trust in the absorption messages and motions of Antananarivo's frontier high society was sold out. He was detained for three days for neglecting to make good on government expenses, a punishment from which he ought to have been exempted because of his status as a low-positioning worker of the pilgrim organization. He had likewise been guaranteed that he would speak to Madagascar at the 1937 Universal Exposition in Paris, yet in May 1937 the provincial specialists educated him that he would not be a piece of the island's appointment. Thusly, Rabearivelo progressed toward becoming disenchanted toward France and its pioneer message of digestion, a slant unequivocally communicated in his diaries. He was moreover dismissed by Malagasy high society, who denounced his unusual conduct and perspectives, especially in light of his job as spouse and father. His countrymen additionally held him in hatred for his apparent energy to grasp the French frontier principle and culture. 

Rabearivelo was profoundly agitated by these mistake and his compounding unending money related inconveniences, notwithstanding the proceeding with pain he felt for the demise of his little girl. On 19 June 1937, a French companion educated him that his plan to in the end gain a higher authority job inside the managerial specialist would never appear as he was to a great extent self-trained and came up short on the required certificates. Having staked his future on an administration profession, Rabearivelo started to muse about his own passing in his diary, expressing "Maybe one needs beyond words be discovered earnest." 

Rabearivelo ended it all by cyanide harming on the evening of 22 June 1937. He may have been truly sick with tuberculosis at the time. The morning of his suicide, Rabearivelo finished a few incomplete works; he at that point took fourteen 250-milligram quinine cases with water at 1:53 pm, pursued at 2:37 pm by ten grams of potassium cyanide. Before kicking the bucket he composed a last sonnet and consumed the initial five volumes of his own diary, the "Calepins Bleus" ("Blue Notebooks", 1924â 1937), leaving four volumes of roughly 1,800 pages that record his life after 4 January 1933. In his last diary sections he recorded the nitty gritty experience of his suicide, finishing up with his last passage at 3:02 pm. At the season of his passing, just 50% of his twenty abstract works had been distributed; the rest of printed after death. 

Rabearivelo's first lovely work, "La roadster de cendres" (1924), shows the apparent dominance of meter and beat in his most punctual works, regardless of a nonappearance of advancement on the exemplary models of verse he employments. The works that pursue this underlying exertion can be comprehensively grouped into two stages, the main being exceedingly impacted by the symbolist and sentimental schools of verse, and the second reflecting more prominent imagination and singularity in close to home articulation, and with a repetitive enthusiasm for accommodating a psychological picture of a "mythic past" with a "distancing advancement". 

In the sentimental period, encapsulated by "Sylves" (1927) and "Volumes" (1928), Rabearivelo's lyrics are shorter and mirror a cleaner type of customary models. He distinguished himself and his work as post-symbolist in the early piece of his masterful vocation. With respect to's works from this period, supervisor Jacques Rabemananjara recognized the artist's obvious ability however studied his over-adherence to shape and idyllic traditions to the detriment of development and certifiable self-articulation. 

Starting in 1931, his works start to change in tone and demonstrate the impacts of surrealism and innovation. His sonnets become all the more brave, free, and complex, while additionally reflecting more prominent uncertainty. As indicated by scholarly Arnaud Sabatier, this change mirrors "the rediscovery and grasp of the sound and pictures of customary Malagasy verse, from which he had recently removed himself or which he had exposed to the pioneer language and culture." These later works are depicted by scholastic Claire Riffard as "his weirdest, bringing out provincial and typical pictures nearby unforeseen fanciful dreams, superimposing the new and the forgottenÂ ..." His break from tradition in this period offered more prominent opportunity to accommodate his tangled personality, for example, through his bilingual manifestations, "Presque-Songes" (1931) and "Traduit de la nuit" (1932). 

Rabearivelo has for some time been viewed as the primary present day artist of Africa. Scholastic Arnaud Sabatier distinguishes him as "a standout amongst the most vital journalists of the twentieth century". He has additionally been depicted by Radio France Internationale columnist Tirthankar Chanda as "the author of the African "francophonie"" and "the "enfant horrendous" of French writing". Rabearivelo is the most universally well known and powerful Malagasy abstract figure. "Jeune Afrique" portrayed him as "Madagascar's most prominent artist", a supposition resounded by LÃ©opold SÃ©dar Senghor, first leader of Senegal and organizer of the "NÃ©gritude" development, who considered him the "ruler of the Malagasy writers". He was portrayed by scholarly Claire Riffard as "one of the primary authors of contemporary Malagasy writing", and following national autonomy in 1960, the legislature of Madagascar confirmed his social commitments by advancing him as the island's national essayist. 

Rabearivelo battled for an amazing duration to accommodate his way of life as Malagasy with his yearning toward French digestion and association with the more noteworthy all inclusive human experience. He has been delineated as a saint figure because of his suicide following the refusal of French specialists to give him consent to go to France. He has been the subject of a noteworthy number of books and gatherings; on the fiftieth commemoration of his demise, his work was recognized at occasions sorted out in North America, Europe and Africa, including seven days in length meeting at the University of Antananarivo. Late grant has scrutinized Rabearivelo's rise as a provincial saint, contending that the artist was all things considered an assimilationist who did not see himself as African. 

The LycÃ©e Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo was initiated in focal Antananarivo on 21 December 1946 out of appreciation for the artist. A room has been committed to the artist in the National Library of Madagascar, situated in the capital city. 

He was incorporated into the original volume of verse of the "NÃ©gritude" development, LÃ©opold Senghor's "Anthologie de la nouvelle poesie negre et malgache" ("Anthology of New Black and Malagasy Poetry"), distributed in 1948. He has roused numerous Malagasy essayists and artists after him, including Elie Rajaonarison, a model of the new flood of Malagasy verse. 

The Francophone University Agency and Madagascar's National Center for Scientific Research teamed up to distribute the total of Rabearivelo's works in three volumes. The principal volume, including his diary and a portion of his correspondence with key figures in artistic and provincial circles, was imprinted in October 2010. The second volume, a gathering of all his recently distributed works, was discharged in July 2012. The staying 1,000 pages of materials delivered by Rabearivelo have been distributed in advanced arrangement.
