The band was established by Englishman Eamon McLoughlin and Australians Kym Warner and Carol Young. The artists initially performed in neighborhood Austin bars, and before long discovered expanding approval. They have discharged one free collection, "Movin' On", in 2003, and two collections, "Climate and Water" and "Viridian", on the Dualtone record mark. Their fourth collection, "Interest", was discharged on Sugar Hill in 2009. Their fifth collection, "The Brick Album" (2011), was self-delivered with the immediate help of their fans. Pre-creation benefactors were perceived with their names recorded on the "blocks" that make up the spread craftsmanship. 

Their presentation collection, "Movin' On", was the beneficiary of neighborhood Texas grants and graphed on Americana radio stations. Down home Music Television named their follow-up "Climate and Water" as one of the ten best twang collections of 2005, and The Greencards were welcome to visit with Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson around the same time. "Viridian" would proceed to take the main position on "Bulletin" magazine's Bluegrass Music Chart, making the Greencards the principal worldwide band to do as such. "Viridian" was a basically applauded collection, and was selected for Best Country Album by the Australian Recording Industry Association.

The Greencards are noted for their joining of different types of music inside an American country sound. Regularly named as a major aspect of, and said to be illustrative of, the "newgrass" development, they draw from Irish society music, wanderer music, shake 'n' move, people balladry, and Latin American melodic sources. The Greencards' sound has been contrasted with dynamic American people shake, and they have been attributed with extending twang music. 

Eamon McLoughlin left the band in December 2009, and dwells in Nashville. Carl Miner, initially from Oregon, joined the gathering in May 2010, playing acoustic guitar. Excavator won the 1999 National Flatpicking Championship at the Walnut Valley Festival, and he dwells in Nashville. 

The Greencards were at first made out of two Australians, Kym Warner on mandolin and Carol Young on bass, and an Englishman, Eamon McLoughlin on fiddle. Brought up in South London, McLoughlin started to perform blue grass music appears with his family on ends of the week, affected by George Jones, George Strait, and Ricky Skaggs. Destined to Irish guardians, McLoughlin's dad was leader of a London-based nation band. At age nine, McLoughlin moved far from piano exercises to play fiddle, and performed with his dad's band. McLoughlin had before migrated from Brighton to Austin in 1997, subsequent to leaving the University of Sussex with a degree in Politics and American Studies. Prepared in London concentrating Royal Schools of Music Grades before emigrating, McLoughlin likewise visited with the Asylum Street Spankers, Austin Lounge Lizards, Bruce Robison and Ray Wylie Hubbard subsequent to landing in the United States. 

Preceding the establishing of The Greencards, Young won the Australian Independent Country Artist of the Year grant in 2000, and had recorded two No.Â 1 Australian-diagrammed blue grass music singles. Youthful was an artist in Outback nation groups and acts, including Gina Jeffreys. Youthful was recently selected as "Best Female Vocalist" by the Country Music Association of Australia, and won the Australian autonomous down home craftsman of the year grant in 2000 due to some extent to her No.Â 1 singles "Honest to goodness Fool" and "Part of the Past". 

Warner was a hopeful twang performer (which was uncommon in Australia) subsequent to taking in of the music from his dad, an early Australian country pioneer. The victor of the Australian National Bluegrass Mandolin Championship for four back to back years, Warner had visited with blue grass music specialists including Gina Jeffreys, and with Young in Kasey Chambers' band. Youthful and Warner knew each other already, and as indicated by Warner, had been attracted to country and American roots music through an energy about George Jones and Merle Haggard. Warner and Young settled on the choice to emigrate to America to seek after melodic vocations in that nation, after they met. Youthful and Warner later lived respectively in Sydney while attempting to look for some kind of employment in the dying Australian country scene. In the wake of leaving Australia, they invested energy in West Texas before migrating to Austin. 

On an early outing the pair took to Austin, Warner and Young met McLoughlin at an account session. Warner was delivering a collection for the chronicle craftsman Bill Atkins and discovered they required a fiddle player, which prompted the enrollment of McLoughlin. At first the outsiders came to know each other through their common love of Monty Python, Benny Hill, and "Fawlty Towers". They started to have jam sessions a short time later and there was obvious science between the trio, which prompted their composition tunes together. They named themselves The Greencards to pay tribute to the way that each of the three band individuals conveyed United States green cards. They in the end started to perform indicates locally in Austin to back the chronicle of what might turn into their presentation collection, 2003's "Movin' On". Simultaneously, they wound up a standout amongst the most well known melodic gatherings in Austin. Delegate of a rising "newgrass" development, the Greencards' acoustic sound was said to consolidate varied impacts from Irish conventional, Romani rover, and Latin American melodic sources. 

Their first execution together as a band was at the Austin Irish bar Mother Egan's. Given an early afternoon to 3Â pm availability, they started to fill the bar with benefactors without fail. Their fans at Mother Egan's before long started considering them the "Country Bunch". A while later, The Greencards started playing out an extra three to five times each week in Austin, notwithstanding their Mother Egan's Sunday appear. Warner credited the wild eyed pace of their execution plan amid their Austin development to their attachment as a gathering and with driving them to make all the more new unique music. Amid their time performing locally in Austin, they visited with different neighborhood Texas artists, including Robert Earl Keen. Warner said that amid their initial profession performing together, crowds would dependably expect they were American artists until they at last talked between melodies, uncovering their English and Australian articulations. 

Mario Tarradell of WFAA-TV news called the possibility of an American country band made out of two Australians and an Englishman not as "over the top" as it might appear. He cited McLoughlin in a meeting: 

Interestingly, we grew up tuning in to basically American music and became hopelessly enamored with American music. I cherish down home music. I grew up with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff was playing in the house. That is the thing that I needed to search out. That is the thing that I needed to play. Hymn was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's father, and he was the principal individual to convey country music to Australia. 

In 2003, The Greencards recorded and self-discharged "Movin' On", their introduction collection, which sold 10,000 duplicates at shows and on the web, and entered the main five on the Americana radio outlines. Pat Flynn, one of the band individuals from the New Grass Revival, guested on the chronicle of "Movin' On" as a session guitarist, and would come back to do as such again on "Climate and Water". The collection was said to defy past conventional norms of twang music by incorporating a jam-band outlook while mixing established people balladry and shake 'n' fold into the sound. Standing out from that examination, the collection was likewise refered to as a customary and fruitful "lo-fi" way to deal with country music. Faultfinders noticed the virtuoso performances on mandolin, fiddle, and guitar on "Movin' On". 

The Greencards increased more fans and ended up known by name rapidly after the arrival of "Movin' On". The band was credited with playing out the most vigorous sets over the span of the 2004 Austin City Limits Music Festival, were said to convey a worldwide sound to twang, andâby illustration on impacts, for example, Bob Dylan and The Beatlesâwere pushing the class' limits. Their live show amid this period was positioned by the "Houston Chronicle" in the main five evenings of unrecorded music for the year in 2004. 

"Movin' On" earned The Greencards the 2004 Austin Music Award for Best New Band. A while after the honors, the band was marked by Dualtone Records and started take a shot at their next collection, "Climate and Water". The mark re-discharged "Movin' On" toward the start of 2005, creating still more airplay and deals. 

Their second Dualtone collection, "Climate and Water", was discharged on June 28, 2005. Cautioned expressed that amid the chronicle sessions, Dualtone Records let them record what they needed, with no impedance or changes mentioned. In an audit of "Climate and Water" in "The Washington Post", it was noticed that on this collection, in contrast to their presentation, the attention was on the music supporting verses, as opposed to the blues virtuosity of "Movin' On". Every one of the three individuals from the band sang on "Climate and Water", however Young's voice was noted for its "marvelous, frequenting quality". Their music through the "Climate and Water" collection had been called Celtic-impacted and country seasoned by John Lehndorff of the "Rough Mountain News", however he noticed that the band had an unmistakably American sound notwithstanding their abroad birthplaces. In mid 2005, The Greencards performed at South by Southwest in Austin out of the blue, and subsequently made their presentation at the renowned MerleFest. 

Jason Gonulsen of "Float Magazine" noticed that The Greencards' introduction "Movin' On" did not catch the band's live vitality, yet that "Climate and Water" defeated this, and was a standout amongst 2005's best twang collections. The music video for the band's single "Time" from "Climate and Water" got overwhelming airplay and turn on Country Music Television. "Time" was portrayed as the focal point track of "Climate and Water". "Climate and Water" was likewise refered to as growing the limits of the country kind. 

Down home Music Television named "Climate and Water" one of its ten most loved twang collections of the year, saying, "At the nexus of twang, nation and pop, this beguiling trio promptly prevail upon such various gatherings of people in show. Fortunately, their triumphant identity means this circleâeven with a few despairing, yet melodic, tunes. Not in vain bobbed Dylan and Willie Nelson pick them to open their mid year voyage through small time ballparks." The Greencards were the opening represent Dylan and Nelson on their 2005 summer visit. Kym Warner credits Gary Paczosa, an architect who chipped away at "Climate and Water", with helping them get the chance to visit with Dylan and Nelson. Paczosa had recently filled in as a designer on accounts for Alison Krauss, Nickel Creek and Dolly Parton. "He makes the best-sounding acoustic records on the planet", as per Warner. All through 2005 they visited broadly with Dylan and Nelson, and thereafter visited with Tommy Emmanuel. Amid the late spring fragment of the 2005 visit with Nelson and Dylan, Warner needed to have the chance to get Dylan's feedback about music and performing. Be that as it may, Warner did not get the chance to invest much energy alone with Dylan amid their time out and about together. Dylan later told Warner toward the finish of the visit, "You'll be fine starting now and into the foreseeable future." 

Toward the finish of 2005, The Greencards moved from Austin to Nashville, to be nearer to their creation organization and its staff. Harmonizing with their turn to Nashville and work on their second collection "Climate and Water", the adjustments in area and sound were seen by pundits to be a conscious move from the jam-style of their introduction collection "Movin' On" to rather focus on Americana-centered music. By 2006, The Greencards had a yearly opening at Merlefest, held yearly in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The band was selected in the Americana Music Association Awards for 2006 in the classification of New/Emerging Artist of the Year, winning the honor. In December 2006, their visit van moved over on a fix of ice in the wake of leaving an exhibition in Bryan, Texas in transit back to Austin, however with no genuine wounds. 

On their past collections, The Greencards had exclusively recorded their melodic tracks independently in seclusion stalls of chronicle studios. For "Viridian", the band individuals recorded their collection together continuously in an open room, which was said to be a factor in making an unconstrained vibe for a portion of the collection. The greater part of the melodies on "Viridian" are sung by Young, and the majority of the tracks were composed by The Greencards, except for "Travel On", which was written by Kim Richey of Nashville. Their sound, through "Viridian", was compared to the Canadian elective nation band The Duhks. After its discharge, "Viridian" guaranteed the No.Â 1 position on "Announcement" magazine's Bluegrass Music Chart. Doug Lancio, a maker who had recently worked with Patty Griffin, was said to have been a positive factor in the accomplishment of "Viridian". Before the 2007 collection, Lancio had not worked with The Greencards. The Greencards are the main universal melodic act to reach No.Â 1 on the Bluegrass Music Chart. 

In a survey of "Viridian", Embo Blake of "Half and half Magazine" noted Carol Young's vocal ability, as she "easily diphthongs rhythm" on the track "Looking out For The Night". As indicated by the WFAA-TV in Dallas/Fort Worth, the collection has a conventional twang center, with a common flavor. Bruce Elder of "The Sydney Morning Herald" called "Viridian" a "visit de compel". 

In the wake of "Viridian", The Greencards have been globally alluded to as a standout amongst the most well known Americana melodic acts in the United States. Bruce Elder proceeded to state that the band may, after "Viridian", be the best blue grass music entertainers to ever leave Australia. In 2007, they were designated for Best Country Album at the 21st Australian Recording Industry Association grants, eventually losing to Keith Urban. In December 2007, it was reported that their melody "Filthy the Duck" from "Viridian" was assigned for the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards, however it at last lost to Brad Paisley's "Throttleneck". Composed by Warner, "Filthy the Duck" was motivated by one of the band's most loved Houston melodic settings, The Mucky Duck. Eamon McLoughlin is a standard blogger for Country Music Television. After the Grammy Awards, he expounded on the band's involvement with the occasion, taking note of that in spite of not winning, the bar had been raised for their next collection. 

The Greencards reported on their site in August 2008 that they had come back to the studio to record their fourth collection with maker Jay Joyce. In September 2008, again by means of their site, they declared that they marked with Sugar Hill Records for their fourth collection, to be discharged in spring 2009. 

On April 21, 2009, The Greencards discharged their fourth studio collection, "Interest". Warner depicts the collection as "their most engaged" work. On their past collections, the three band individuals had exclusively advanced thoughts for the music, until enough adhered into the completed work. For "Interest", he says they set aside their individual pride to make a more grounded work. The long periods of visiting knowledge The Greencards have collected since their soonest work has helped them, too. Alluding to when they framed the band, he stated, "We simply played in Austin. We just composed likely anything, which was the main stuff we knew, which was to a greater degree a conventional thing. Yet, from that point forward, we've had five or six years of visiting, the majority of the encounters, the majority of the general population you meet. We've been so lucky to play at all of these celebrations which have an extremely varied type of music styles." 

As per Young, the music on "Interest" was a movement for the band, and a test for them. Contrasting their earlier work with the new collection, she stated, "They're presumably more twang affected than this one here. While despite everything we have the country and roots music impacts, we truly needed to propel ourselves harder on this one, something more testing to play live." She portrayed their music through their fourth collection as having advanced, clarifying that it started as customary roots and twang, yet following six years is "our own little solid". The track "The Crystal Merchant" was selected for the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance. 

In 2009, The Greencards kept on visiting, performing again at MerleFest, the Strawberry Park Bluegrass Festival in Preston, Connecticut, Bluegrass in the Park in Henderson, Kentucky, and were on the bill for Lollapalooza. 

On November 8, 2010, The Greencards declared that they would self-fund the generation on their next collection, set for May 2011, instead of taking a development from a record organization. The "Purchase A Brick" battle is selling a bundle of a development duplicate of the last CD, an advanced picture of the collection work of art, video updates of the account of the collection and the supporter's name (up to twenty characters) on the collection fine art. Memberships are either $100 or $200 US with the more costly bundle getting the collection multi week sooner and the supporter's name on the facade of the CD bundle. 

Considered by faultfinders to be a piece of the dynamic twang ("newgrass") melodic school, The Greencards draw from a wide assortment of melodic impacts, extending from Bob Dylan and the Beatles to the Celtic tone of Irish conventional music, vagabond subjects, and Latin sounds. In spite of the wide cluster of impacts that shape their music, The Greencards have constantly kept up a particularly Americana sound. While the different sounds that impact their work are constantly perceivable, none ever overwhelm the band's music. Jim Abbott of the "Tribune News Service" depicted The Greencards as cleaned, "natural, beguiling roots music with a refined sheen", yet noticed that some country perfectionists may miss the vocal mannerisms that can be found on different acts, for example, the Del McCoury Band. Their intrigue has been credited to both their "instrumental expertise" just as the way in which they both adore and display twang traditions. The dynamic idea of The Greencards' country sound has been contrasted with Nickel Creek and Alison Krauss and Union Station. 

The Greencards' work on "Movin' On" had a looser, jam-based inclination to it, which they later solidified into a progressively cleaned sound subsequent to moving to Nashville from Austin for "Climate and Water". John T. Davis in "No Depression Magazine" expressed The Greencards' best work on "Climate and Water" contained a "stillness", which he felt diverged from the speed and "mad" pace of a portion of the melodies on "Movin' On". While different pundits had referenced The Greencards with regards to stick groups, Davis proceeded to state that he felt the band was not one, and that they supported a more slender and "clean" stable driven more by Celtic roots. 

Amid their 2005 visit with Dylan and Nelson, Buzz McClain of "The Washington Post" trusted that The Greencards play conventional American music superior to anything a few Americans do, on account of their profound regard for country and the Americana sound. As per David McPherson in "Twang Unlimited" magazine, the band's three-section harmonies bring out the spirit hints of gospel music. Kym Warner has said that Robert Earl Keen, Kelly Willis, and Patty Griffin were key impacts musically in The Greencards' sound amid their time in Austin, with the beforehand unreleased Griffin tune "What You Are" being secured on their collection "Climate and Water". The chronicles on "Viridian", specifically the melodies "Waterway of Sand", "Looking out for the Night" and "When I Was in Love With You", were said to inspire the hints of dynamic people shake that developed during the 1960s. In "Nashville Scene", Edd Hurt noticed the mixed tone of the band's general group of accounts, and trusted that their collections had a place with the convention of artist lyricist performers. 

Their melodic intrigue to fans has been credited to both their "instrumental aptitude" just as the way in which they both venerate and parade country traditions. Naila Francis depicted The Greencards' sound as having a smooth tone, with "delicate ballards and yarns" in their tunes, however punctuated by blasts of vigorous melodic eagerness. Down home Music Television specifically noticed their despairing however melodic sound. The Greencards have depicted their sound as "high vitality acoustic music".
