"Lord of War III" is an activity experience amusement with hack and slice components. It is a third-individual single-player computer game. Likewise with past portions, the player controls the character Kratos from a fixed-camera point of view in combo-based battle, platforming, and confuse recreations. The foes are a variety of Greek legendary animals, including centaurs, shrews, figments, cyclopes, satyrs, minotaurs, Sirens, cerberuses, and Gorgons. The player should likewise climb dividers and stepping stools, hop crosswise over gorges, and swing on ropes to continue through the diversion. The riddles included change in trouble: a few riddles just expect articles to be set in a particular position, while some require timing and accuracy, for example, a riddle with mechanics like "Guitar Hero". Notwithstanding discovering Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers of the past diversions, Minotaur Horns are another thing to be found. Where the eyes and quills increment the player's wellbeing and enchantment meters, the horns increment the things meter, which permits further utilization of auxiliary weapons, called "Things". 

Kratos' principle weapon is the Blades of Exile, supplanting the Blades of Athena utilized in past portions and the opening snapshots of the diversion. The weapon is a couple of cutting edges appended to chains folded over the Kratos' wrists and lower arms that can be swung in various moves. Amid the diversion, Kratos gains new weaponsâthe Claws of Hades, the Nemean Cestus, and the Nemesis Whipâwith other battle choices. The Nemean Cestus, a couple of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, like the Blades of Exile, are required to progress in parts of the amusement; for instance, the Nemean Cestus is expected to get through items made out of onyx. 

Not at all like in past amusements, mysterious capacities are found out with the obtaining of another weapon, giving every weapon its own enchantment assault; for instance, the Army of Sparta may just be utilized with the Blades of Exile. Enchantment gives Kratos an assortment of approaches to assault and murder adversaries, for example, the Claws of Hades' Soul Summon capacity, which invokes spirits to assault foes. Other enchantment incorporates the Nemean Cestus' Nemean Roar and the Nemesis Whip's Nemesis Rage. Notwithstanding four essential weapons, three optional ones, known as Items, are gained: the Bow of Apollo, the Head of Helios, and the Boots of Hermes. Every one of the three are required to progress in specific phases of the amusement; for instance, the Head of Helios can be utilized as a lamp in dull regions and to uncover concealed entryways. 

The relics Poseidon's Trident, the Golden Fleece, and Icarus' Wings gained in past amusements are held and used to beat natural obstructions, with the Golden Fleece used to redirect foe assaults. Hades' Soul permits Kratos to swim in the River Styx. The Blade of Olympus, an essential weapon in "Divine force of War II", is utilized in this amusement with the extraordinary capacity Rage of Sparta for brief immunity and expanded assault harm. 

New increments to the ongoing interaction incorporate the battle catch, an extended snatch move which, contingent upon the weapon, can pull Kratos towards adversaries or power them awayâfundamental at specific focuses in the diversion, with Kratos riding wenches crosswise over abyssesâand a basic get enabling him to utilize a frail adversary as a battering ram. Kratos can now quickly switch among the four essential weapons in fight, proceeding with a similar assault blend. Other additional highlights incorporate the option of ten Godly Possessions, regularly covered up close crushed enemies and giving extra capacities like boundless enchantment amid reward play. The test mode in this diversion is known as the Challenge of Olympus (seven preliminaries) and is opened after the amusement's finish. This mode expects players to finish a progression of explicit errandsâfor instance, killing all foes without weapons in a restricted measure of time. The player may open extra rewards, for example, extra ensembles for Kratos, off camera recordings, and idea craft of the characters and situations, by finishing the amusement's trouble levels and challenge mode. Another mode, the Combat Arena, enables players to set trouble levels and pick adversaries to sharpen playing aptitudes. 

Similarly as with past recreations, "Divine force of War III" is set in a substitute variant of antiquated Greece populated by Olympian divine beings, Titans, saints, and different characters from Greek folklore. The diversion is set over a few areas on Mount Olympus, including the Tomb of Ares, the antiquated city of Olympia, the Path of Eos, the Labyrinth, a few zones of the Palace of the Gods, for example, the Forum and Hera's Gardens, and the Underworld and Tartarus. 

The Tomb of Aresâlodging the previous God of War's remaining partsâand the city of Olympia lie on the sides of Mount Olympus. Just past the city is the Path of Eos, a shrouded natural hollow close to the foot of Olympus. The Palace of the Gods is the home of the Olympians, and highlights the Forum (a little open air theater), Hera's Gardens, and the assemblies of Aphrodite and Poseidon. The Labyrinth is a substantial airborne riddle built by the draftsman Daedalus to detain Pandora in the Caverns of Olympus, home of Skorpius and its posterity. The Underworld, managed by Hades and separated by the River Styx, is the domain of the dead. Hades' royal residence contains the remaining parts of his better half, Persephone, whom Kratos murdered in "". The Underworld is additionally home to statues of the three Judges of the Underworld, who hold the Chain of Balance associating the Underworld to Olympus. Tartarus is the jail of the dead where the Titan Cronos was ousted after Kratos recovered Pandora's Box from Pandora's Temple in "Divine force of War". 

Kratos (voiced by Terrence C. Carson), the hero of the diversion, is a Spartan mythical being warrior who turned into the God of War in the wake of murdering Ares and looks for retribution on Zeus for his double-crossing. Different characters incorporate Greek divine beings, for example, Athena (Erin Torpey), the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' coach and partner; Zeus (Corey Burton), King of the Gods and the essential foe; Poseidon (Gideon Emery), God of the Sea; Hades (Clancy Brown), God of the Underworld; Hephaestus (Rip Torn), the Smith God; Hermes (Greg Ellis), Messenger of the Gods and the God of Speed and Commerce; Helios (Crispin Freeman), the Sun God; Hera (Adrienne Barbeau), Queen of the Gods who controls vegetation; and Aphrodite (April Stewart), Goddess of Love and Sexuality. A few Titans are highlighted, including Gaia (Susan Blakeslee), Cronos (George Ball), Epimetheus, Oceanus, and Perses. Different characters incorporate Hercules (Kevin Sorbo), a mythical being and Kratos' stepbrother; the modeler Daedalus (Malcolm McDowell), Icarus' dad; and Pandora (Natalie Lander), Hephaestus' fake little girl. Minor characters incorporate the three Judges of the Underworld: King Minos (Mark Moseley), King Rhadamanthus, and King Aeacus; Peirithous (Simon Templeman), an Underworld detainee in affection with Persephone, and Kratos' better half and little girl: Lysandra (Gwendoline Yeo) and Calliope (Debi Derryberry), who show up in a plot grouping in which Kratos travels through his own mind. 

Proceeding following "Divine force of War II", Kratos, Gaia, and different Titans climb Mount Olympus to obliterate the Olympian divine beings. Poseidon dispatches an attack against the Titans, yet is murdered by Kratos and Gaia; his demise makes the seas flood Greece. Achieving the pinnacle of Olympus, they endeavor to assault Zeus, yet he drives them back and thumps them off the mountain. Gaia sticks to the mountainside and will not spare Kratos, calling him simply a pawn for the Titans' vengeance. 

Kratos falls into the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; the spirits of the Underworld debilitate him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Moving from the waterway, he is gone up against by Athena's soul, who had recently yielded herself to spare Zeus from Kratos. She reveals to Kratos that her penance has conveyed her to a higher presence, and she presently observes realities she didn't see previously. She expresses that as long as Zeus rules, there is no desire for humankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that he should smother the Flame of Olympus to execute Zeus. Subsequent to finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos experiences the soul of Pandora, whom he confuses with his dead little girl, Calliope. Declining to support the tyke, he proceeds with his journey. Subsequent to experiencing the Olympian metal forger Hephaestus and recouping the Blade of Olympus, he slaughters Hades and discharges the spirits of the Underworld. He thinks about hunting down Calliope's spirit, however Athena helps Kratos to remember his journey, and he leaves the Underworld, touching base at Olympia, where he finds the injured Gaia, who calls for help. He disjoins her arm, making her tumble from Mount Olympus to her obvious demise. 

Kratos proceeds with his rising, killing incredible enemies that incorporate the Titan Perses and the god Helios; Helios' demise dives Greece into interminable dimness. This prompts an experience with Hermes, who derides Kratos for his past sins. Kratos pursues Hermes and touches base at the Chamber of the Flame. Kratos finds that Pandora's Box is in the Flame of Olympus and is vital to the achievement of his mission, as it was in "Divine force of War" (2005). Athena shows up, revealing to Kratos that the flares around the container must be subdued by Pandora. Kratos then proceeds after the pompous Hermes, whom he gets and slaughters, discharging a plague on Greece. At the Forum, he has a crowd of people with the tipsy Hera, who overlooks his solicitation for Pandora's area and request Hercules. In the wake of examining his envy of his stepbrother, Hercules assaults Kratos, however is executed. Kratos then experiences Aphrodite, who is apathetic regarding his war on Olympus. She drives him to her alienated spouse Hephaestus through Hyperion's Gate, a teleportation gadget. In a suicide mission, the smithy sends Kratos to Tartarus to recover the Omphalos Stone so he can fashion another weapon for the Spartan. Kratos discovers Cronos, murders the Titan for the stone, and comes back to Hephaestus. Subsequent to manufacturing the weapon, the god attempts to murder Kratos himself. Rather, the Spartan executes Hephaestus, who guarantees that he was endeavoring to secure his girl Pandora, who was detained in the Labyrinth after Kratos opened her crate. Reusing the Hyperion Gate, Kratos goes through Hera's Gardens where he murders Hera, finishing all Greek vegetation, and advances toward the Labyrinth to discover Pandora. 

The detained modeler Daedalus advises Kratos to join the Labyrinth. Finishing this assignment, Kratos battles his way through the ethereal riddle and protects Pandora, who instructs him to break the Chain of Balance so the Labyrinth can be raised, and she can contact her container. Killing the three judges and breaking the chain, Kratos raises the Labyrinth, and Pandora endeavors to enter the Flame of Olympus. Zeus mediates and battles Kratos; after a short fight, Pandora penances herself and extinguishes the fire, regardless of Kratos' dissents. Discovering Pandora's Box unfilled, Kratos assaults Zeus. Gaia returns and endeavors to murder them, however they escape through her vast chest wound and proceed with their fight. Gaia is slaughtered when Kratos skewers Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which evidently likewise murders Zeus. At the point when Kratos recoups the edge and attempts to leave, he is assaulted by Zeus' soul and loses the majority of his weapons simultaneously. Before Zeus can arrive a lethal blow, Kratos is spared by Pandora amid an adventure into his mind. With assistance from the spirits of his better half Lysandra and his little girl Calliope, Kratos pardons himself for his past sins. Subsequent to finding trust, he recovers cognizance and pounds the life out of Zeus with his uncovered hands, finishing the rule of the Olympian Gods. 

Athena returns, requesting that Kratos return what she supposes he took from Pandora's Box. She won't trust the container was vacant, clarifying that when Zeus fixed the indecencies of the world in the case, she set expectation in it, predicting that it would in the long run be opened. Athena understands that when Kratos opened the case to overcome Ares, the shades of malice got away and tainted the divine beings while Kratos was pervaded with expectation, which empowered him to murder Ares. She advises Kratos to restore her capacity, saying that she realizes how to utilize it to modify what had been obliterated. Doubting Athena and tired of being utilized as a pawn, Kratos won't; saying his retribution has finished, he skewers himself with the Blade of Olympus and discharges would like to mend all he had pulverized. An irate Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has baffled her and leaves with nothing. Close passing, Kratos crumples as Athena leaves. 

In a post-credits scene, a trail of blood leads from a surrendered Blade of Olympus, with Kratos' whereabouts obscure. 

In a 2007 meeting with GameTrailers, "Divine force of War" maker and diversion chief David Jaffe clarified his unique aim for the arrangement, which is not quite the same as the genuine completion of "Lord of War III", which depended on amusement executive Stig Asmussen's vision. Jaffe's thought was that ""God of War" clarifies, or eventually will clarify, why there are not any more Greek legends". He said that it would have been "terrible" as the divine beings and Titans fought each other for mastery. Other legendary pantheons would have progressed toward becoming required after Kratos murdered Zeus and the other Greek divine beings, and the outcome would be that mankind never again had confidence in the divine beingsâas indicated by Jaffe, the main way a divine being can genuinely kick the bucket. "Divine force of War III" was first referenced by "Lord of War II" diversion executive Cory Barlog at a "Divine force of War II" dispatch occasion. Barlog said that the diversion would have full 1080p HD goals (changed to 720p in definite discharge) and bolster Sixaxis tilt and vibration capacities. Declared before the DualShock 3 controller was presented, this caused disarray since the Sixaxis controller does not bolster thunder. Amid the 2009 Game Developers Conference (GDC), the inventive group said that the Sixaxis tilt capacity had been evacuated on the grounds that they "couldn't locate an appropriate circumstance to utilize Sixaxis in the amusement viably". 

After the initial eight months of advancement, Barlog left Santa Monica for different chances, and Stig Asmussen took over as diversion executive; Asmussen recently filled in as lead condition craftsman and workmanship chief on "Lord of War" and "Divine force of War II", separately. In a meeting with IGN, Asmussen said that Barlog "majorly affected the amusement" and despite the fact that he had left the group, they talked a few times a while later and "ricocheted a couple of thoughts off him," yet there was no formal coordinated effort. He additionally said that David Jaffe "[had] been around the studio a couple of times" and they "[had] gone over some abnormal state stuff with him to get his perceptions and criticism." Early being developed when Barlog was still with the group, he communicated enthusiasm for an agreeable mode "on the off chance that we can accomplish something one of a kind with it". In November 2009, Asmussen told "GamePro" that despite the fact that a multiplayer choice had been talked about, it was unsatisfactory for "Divine force of War III": "There's a story we need to advise and an encounter we need to convey, and multi-player doesn't fit into that." By December 2009, the amusement was in its last formative stages. 

In December 2008, Sony announced that "Divine force of War III" would be the last diversion in the arrangement. In any case, in January 2010 John Hight told Joystiq: "While "Divine force of War III" will close the set of three, it won't spell the finish of the franchiseÂ ... We will be extremely watchful about what we do straightaway". Asmussen referenced the likelihood of downloadable substance; the diversion would be delivered with the ordinary test mode, and new test modes may be discharged as downloadable substance to keep up the arrangement. In March 2009, it was accounted for that Sony was looking for feelings about a gatherer's release from PlayStation 3 proprietors. In October, an "Extreme Edition" was revealed for North America, and an "Extreme Trilogy Edition" was reported soon a short time later for a constrained European, Australian, and New Zealand discharge. A "Set of three Edition" was reported for Japan, where the Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO) gave the amusement a grown-ups just Z rating after the past two forms were viewed as appropriate for players 17 and more seasoned. 

Asmussen said that one of the best difficulties in creating "Divine force of War III" for the PlayStation 3 was the "unpredictability of everything"; singular undertakings, for example, planning Helios' beheading, could take a year in light of the fact that the "dimension of detail [that was] expected [was] so high and mind boggling, it [crossed] different offices." He said that the PlayStation 3's equipment abilities permitted greater adaptability in character creation and cooperation with nature. The character demonstrate for Kratos in the PlayStation 2 (PS2) recreations utilized around 5,000 polygons; the PS3 show was around 20,000 â a high number, however not as much as that utilized by different models, for example, Nathan Drake in "", who utilized 35,000. Ken Feldman, the workmanship chief, remarked that the polygon check was not by any means the only factor, and refered to the expanded surface detail as one reason for Kratos' practical appearance. The engineers utilized another strategy called mixed ordinary mapping to add authenticity to the essential model and gigantically improve the scope of activity accessible (e.g., muscle development, including unmistakable veins, and facial livelinesss). The majority of the principle heroes were enlivened by hand in light of the fact that the artists created more powerful work than fundamental movement catch, however the voice on-screen characters' facial developments were recorded by Image Metrics' execution catch framework. For enlivening things like hair, the illustrators made an auxiliary liveliness code, known as Dynamic Simulation, which enables the PS3 itself to numerically compute the manner in which it should look; it precisely creates movement that recently took the artists extended periods to reproduce. 

The motor for "Divine force of War III" was from the initial two portions. Santa Clause Monica senior maker Steve Caterson said that the advancement group ported "Divine force of War II"s motor to the PlayStation 3 and had the capacity to rapidly play the amusement. Everything that Kratos could do in past recreations, he could do on the PlayStation 3, which enabled the engineers to quickly start structuring new substance. As the diversion was being built up, the code division would swap out PlayStation 2 segments with PlayStation 3 parts. They supplanted the renderer, the molecule framework, and the impact framework. Feldman said that despite the fact that they were re-utilizing the motor from "Lord of War II", the center motor for "Divine force of War III" was fresh out of the plastic new. Between the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and the time the diversion delivered, morphological enemy of associating (MLAA) was included, which illustrations engineer Ben Diamand said "improved edges drastically and spared considerable measures of edge rate." MLAA is "now a well known edge-location process that can cost-viably expel spiked edges from each casing", which helped Santa Monica free up the preparing cycle and "enabled them to add to the exhibition in different ways." Diamand likewise said that "profundity of-field, movement obscure, crepuscular 'god' beams and refraction were either included or improved in quality and speed" amid that equivalent timespan. 

Asmussen assessed in general amusement length to be 10 to 20 hours, "contingent upon how great of a gamer you are." Santa Monica studio chief John Hight consoled players that "Divine force of War III" endures longer than 10 hours: "We've completed a ton of play testing on itÂ ... We know, for an extremely in-your-face player, it'll take them longer than it took them to play both of the past "Divine force of War" diversions." The completed amusement content was around 120 pages in length, and the quantity of onscreen foes expanded from 15 in the past recreations to a limit of 50. To light the diversion, Turtle by Illuminate Labs was utilized. Head of advancement Christer Ericson of SCE Santa Monica Studio affirmed that "Divine force of War III" has consistent stacking; no stacking screens and no hard plate drive establishment prerequisite. SCE America illustrator Bruno Velazquez said that while the initial two "Divine force of War" titles had PC produced symbolism (CGI) cinematics, there would be no evident CGI in the third amusement: "all the cutscenes are made utilizing our in-diversion motor." A "Lord of War III" amusement trailer appeared on Spike's "GameTrailers TV" on February 11, 2010, and Asmussen affirmed that all recording is of ongoing interaction. New camera points were included; amid some real fights the player can even now control Kratos while the camera skillet far from the battle, and a first-individual camera see was utilized for the last bit of the Poseidon and Zeus supervisor battles. As indicated by Sony Santa Monica chief of innovation Tim Moss, "Divine force of War III" utilized 35 gigabytes (GB) of Blu-beam Disk. "Divine force of War III"s spending plan was $44Â million USD, and the amusement had a staff of 132 toward the finish of its improvement. 

A few voice performing artists came back from past portions, including Terrence C. Carson, Erin Torpey, Corey Burton, Debi Derryberry, and Gwendoline Yeo, voicing Kratos, Athena, Zeus, Calliope, and Lysandra, separately. Susan Blakeslee, who voiced two characters in "Divine force of War", voiced Gaia. Storyteller Linda Hunt, who recently voiced Gaia, just gave an early on portrayal to the diversion. Tear Torn, Natalie Lander, and Malcolm McDowell joined the cast of voice on-screen characters. Lloyd Sherr and Nolan North, who had initially voiced Cronos and Hades, were supplanted by George Ball and Clancy Brown, separately. Kevin Sorbo was picked to voice Hercules due to his depiction of the character in the TV arrangement, "". Elijah Wood had a minor voice job, and Josh Keaton and Fred Tatasciore, who voiced characters in past amusements, additionally had minor jobs.
