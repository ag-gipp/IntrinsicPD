He was the oldest of nine kids to an English-conceived father, John Richard Shout, and Irish mother, Agnes Mary (nÃ©e Kelly, some time ago McGovern). Data on Alfred Shout's initial life is fairly sparse and the subtleties contrast between sources, yet as per his First World War validation structure he was secretly instructed. In mid 1900, Shout made a trip to South Africa with his senior relative, William McGovern. The siblings tried to go along with one of the pioneer contingents at that point occupied with the Second Boer War; Alfred enrolled in the recently raised Border Horse on 17 February 1900, while William (utilizing the surname Shout) found a spot in Bethune's Mounted Infantry. The Border Horse was a sporadic pilgrim drive shaped in eastern Cape Colony, and Shout was dispensed to the unit's No.Â 1 Company with the administration number 9216.

Yell chose to stay in South Africa after his release and, in 1903, enrolled in the Cape Colonial Forces.

While living in Cape Town, Shout wedded Rose Alice Howe, an Australian from Sydney, in 1905; the couple had a little girl named Florence in June that year. In 1907, the Shout family moved to Australia, settling in the Sydney suburb of Darlington. Here, Shout picked up work as a woodworker and joiner at Resch's Brewery.

Yell was charged as a second lieutenant in the Citizens' Forces on 16 June 1914. 

Following the flare-up of the First World War, Shout connected for a commission in the recently raised Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 18 August 1914. The AIF was framed as Australia's expeditionary power to battle in the war, as the Citizens' Forces were confined to home protection per the Defense Act (1903). Yell's application was acknowledged on 28 August and he was presented on the first Battalion as a second lieutenant in F Company, directed by Lieutenant Cecil Sasse. As indicated by his therapeutic evaluation at the time, Shout remained at , weighed , and was recorded as having "great" visual perception. On 18 October, the first Battalion set out for the Middle East, with Shout boarding HMAT "Afric" at Sydney. Cruising by means of Albany, Western Australia, the troopship landed in Egypt on 2 December. Soon after, the first Battalion was redesigned into four organizations; Shout was designated to D Company as a detachment leader. The regiment went through the following four months preparing in the Egyptian desert, amid which time Shout was advanced lieutenant on 1 February 1915. 

As a major aspect of an undertaking to overcome the Ottoman Empire and power a supply course through to Russia by means of the Bosporus and the Black Sea, the British War Council defined an arrangement to attack the Gallipoli Peninsula. On 25 April 1915, the men of the first Australian Brigadeâof which the first Battalion was partâarrived at Anzac Cove somewhere in the range of 05:30 and 07:30 among the second and third influxes of Australian troops. The first Battalion was intended to be held for possible later use, however because of overwhelming losses and disarray the unit before long went energetically. Following a solicitation for fortifications, Shout climbed with one of the first Battalion's organizations to the slope highlight Baby 700. Landing at the situation around 11:00, he drove involved with hold the back left flank of the slope as a component of the Australians' rearguard activity. The Australian position on Baby 700 had turned out to be critical by that evening, a circumstance exacerbated by the modest number of accessible infantry in the territory and the total absence of big guns support, when the Turkish powers propelled a counter-ambush. At this point, Shout and Lieutenant Leslie Morshead of the second Battalion were the main two enduring officers in their area of the line. At 16:30, the Turks got through the guarded line and the Australians were compelled to desert their situation on the slope. Yell was one of the last to clear, and pulled back down towards the shoreline. Amid his retreat, Shout experienced Lieutenant Colonel George Braund, leader of the second Battalion, on Walker's Ridge. Braund dispatched Shout to the shoreline with a solicitation for fortifications. Yell appropriately transferred the message, and was promptly entrusted with driving 200 stray men to fortify the slender protective line close to Braund's position. Yell set up a post at the base of the edge as sunset fell, and his men began to dive in. 

By 27 April, Shout had been constantly in real life without rest since the arrival. That morning, he was sent to Walker's Ridge to supplant an injured officer in a defenseless part of the line. As the Turks involved positions in the clean just past the Australians' channel, Shout and his men were exposed to exact and substantial rifle discharge for the duration of the day. As needs be, Shout revamped his men and, presenting himself to the Turks' flame, wandered out to survey the foe's position. He was then ready to precisely coordinate the rifle discharge of his men. In spite of the fact that injured from the get-go in the activity, Shout wouldn't leave the cutting edge. As the battling wore on, the Turks surrounded the Australian channel and Shout drove a pike charge to hold them under control. He was later injured a second time, a projectile going through his arm and rendering it pointless. In any case, he would not leave. Before long, he was injured a third time and cleared for therapeutic treatment. Amid the commitment, Shout had diverted a few injured men from the bleeding edge. Refered to for his "obvious strength and capacity" at Walker's Ridge, Shout was granted the Military Cross, turning into the main individual from his unit to get the embellishment. The notice and going with reference for the honor was distributed in an enhancement to the "London Gazette" on 3 July 1915. 

Yell's injuries turned out to be moderately light and he before long rejoined the first Battalion. On 11 May, he was injured by and by, enduring a second discharge to his arm. He was cleared to the clinic dispatch HMHS "Gascon", yet rejoined his unit fifteen days after the fact. On 20 May, Shout was referenced in the despatch of General Sir Ian Hamilton, General Officer Commanding the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, in acknowledgment of his endeavors from the arrival on 25 April to 5 May. He was elevated to skipper on 29 July. 

On 6 August 1915, the first Australian Brigade propelled a strike on the secure Ottoman position at Lone Pine. Driven by the second, third and fourth Battalions (with the first Battalion held for possible later use), the assault was arranged to occupy Turkish consideration and fortifications from the essential task toward the north of the line as the British looked to catch the Sari Bair edge. The Australian strike at Lone Pine started in the late evening just before dusk. An ordnance blast had gone before the assault, however as indicated by student of history Robin Prior the outcomes had been "weak" and the development was hard-battled. Regardless, inside 30 minutes the Australians had broken the Turkish channels and caught their destinations. In spite of the underlying achievement, Australian setbacks had been substantial and the first Battalion was requested forward in anticipation of the normal Turkish counter-assault. The fight slid into furious battling about the following three days, frequently as what Bryan Perrett has depicted as "lethal shelling duels". 

At 09:00 on 9 August, the day after Shout's 33rd birthday, the first Battalion diminished the third Battalion on the Lone Pine front at a position known as Sasse's Sap. Before long, the Turks reestablished their assault and recovered a stretch of the sap. Resolved to defeat these men, and bolstered by his very own couple troopers, Shout pursued one channel tossing bombs. He slaughtered eight Turks, and figured out how to clear others to retake the channel. In the mean time, Captain Cecil SasseâShout's previous organization authorityâaccumulated three men with sandbags, and cleared another area of the sap. Equipped with a rifle, Sasse had pursued the channel at the leader of his men. His gathering before long found a gathering of Turks concentrated on, and terminating in, an alternate bearing; Sasse and his men executed 12 and constrained the rest of escape. Sasse kept on keeping the Turks under control with rifle discharge as his men blockaded the channel with the sandbags. 

Sasse, depicted by authority antiquarian Charles Bean as "elated" by the accomplishment that morning, moved toward Shout with a proposition to rehash the accomplishment. Yell concurred. The couple gathered a gathering of eight men this opportunity to convey sandbags and additional bombs. Having observed the Turks' position, the recently raised blockade was pushed down and, next to each other, Sasse and Shout kept running forward. While Sasse shot his gun and Shout heaved bombs, the Australian party progressed in short stages along the channel and fabricated a blockade each time they ended. Bean composed that Shout battled with "awe inspiring jollity" all through the attack, student of history Stephen Snelling including that Shout was "chuckling and clowning and rooting for his men". As the Australians advanced, the two officers found an appropriate position to raise their last blockade. Preparing himself for this last push forward, Shout all the while lit three bombs. He effectively tossed two, yet the third blasted similarly as it was leaving his hand. Yell was deplorably injured; the blast burned his correct hand and part of the left, pulverized his left eye, cut his cheek, and made consumes his chest and leg. Notwithstanding the seriousness of his injuries Shout stayed cognizant and was hauled out of the terminating line, where, "still happy" as indicated by Bean, he "drank tea and made an impression on his significant other". 

Yell was cleared from the Gallipoli Peninsula to the clinic dispatch "Euralia" not long after he was injured. He kicked the bucket two days after the fact, on 11 August 1915, and was covered adrift. Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Bennett, boss of the first Battalion, marked Shout's activities at Lone Pine as "splendid" and depicted him as "inaccessible in his impressive authority". In spite of the fact that Sasse's Sap was not totally recuperated, Shout was after death granted the Victoria Cross (VC) in acknowledgment of his endeavors to recoup a great part of the channel framework, while Sasse got the Distinguished Service Order. Yell's VC was the seventh and last granted to the AIF for the activities around Lone Pine, and the second to an individual from the first Battalion. Yell's three heroism grants from Gallipoli additionally checked him as the most profoundly designed individual from the AIF for the crusade. 

The declaration of Shout's VC was proclaimed in the "London Gazette" on 15 October 1915, perusing: 

There was significant perplexity following Shout's passing. Armed force Headquarters in Melbourne cabled Rose Shout on 15 August to educate her that Alfred had been injured. Affirmation of his demise was passed on to her, yet was repudiated by a later link on 23 August. This correspondence expressed that Shout was not dead, yet alive and coming back to Australia on board the "Thermistocles". The press in Australia distributed updates on his pending return, including that he would land in Sydney in mid-September. This ended up being an instance of mixed up personality. Yell's demise was affirmed by 26 August; a Lieutenant A.J. Shirt, additionally of the first Battalion, was the officer on board the "Thermistocles". Rose Shout got an ecclesiastical expression of remorse for the administrative mistakes and trouble caused. 

Yell is celebrated on the Lone Pine Memorial, and he was recollected by the residents of Darlington with a dedication plaque. The representative general, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, disclosed the plaque at the Darlington Town Hall in a function on 20 November 1915. The plaque has since entered the accumulations of the Victoria Barracks Museum in Paddington. In 1916, to respect "the brave and radiant deeds and passing" of Shout and assuage the money related strain set upon his better half, a gathering was taken up by nearby residents in Sydney to furnish Rose and their girl with a house. 

Until 2006 Shout's awards were in the ownership of his family. That year, Shout's grandson chose to pitch the awards to assuage a portion of the family obligation and money related weights. At the time Shout's VC was the just a single granted to an individual from the AIF at Gallipoli that was not in the gathering of the Australian War Memorial. The decorations were unloaded by the Sydney firm Bonhams and Goodman on 24 July 2006, and understood a world record hammer cost of AU$1 million. The deal outperformed, nearly multiplying, the past sale records for a decorationâset by the Naval Gold Medal granted to Sir Thomas Hardy, first Baronetâand the cost paid for a VC, 

recently held by that granted to Norman Cyril Jackson. Yell's decorations were acquired by news big shot Kerry Stokes, who in this way gave the set to the Australian War Memorial for presentation in the Hall of Valor.
