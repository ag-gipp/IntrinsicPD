Stretford was a piece of the land involved by the Celtic Brigantes clan previously and amid the Roman occupation, and lay on their outskirt with the Cornovii on the southern side of the Mersey. By 1212, there were two estates in the zone presently called Stretford. The land in the south, near the River Mersey, was held by Hamon de Mascy, while the land in the north, closer to the River Irwell, was held by Henry de Trafford. In around 1250, a later Hamon de Mascy gave the Stretford estate to his little girl, Margery. She thusly, in around 1260, allowed Stretford to Richard de Trafford at a lease of one penny. The de Mascy family in the blink of an eye a while later discharged all rights to their properties in Stretford to Henry de Trafford, the Trafford family consequently getting the entire of Stretford, since when the two estates dropped together.

In spite of the fact that there is known to have been a papermill working in 1765, the zone remained to a great extent country until the mid twentieth century improvement of Trafford Park in the Old Trafford region north of the town. Up to that point Stretford "stayed out of sight of day by day life in England", aside from a short appearance job amid the Jacobite ascending of 1745, when Crossford Bridge was demolished to keep an intersection by Bonnie Prince Charlie's military amid its unsuccessful development on London; the scaffold was rapidly revamped. 

Until the 1820s one of Stretford's principle cabin enterprises was the hand-weaving of cotton.
