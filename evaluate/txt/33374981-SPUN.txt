Unconscious of the occurrence, Bindu proposes to the withering Nani by phone; it is the exact opposite thing Nani hears before he is resurrected as a housefly that can't recall its past life. 

The fly's memory is activated when it experiences Sudeep and Bindu. Sudeep asks the grief stricken Bindu to go with him to New Delhi to meet the training clergyman; on the off chance that she can inspire the pastor with an introduction about the NGO, he may enable it to increase national acknowledgment. The fly causes Sudeep to have a mishap on his way to the airplane terminal and states "I will slaughter you" on the windshield; this makes Sudeep jumpy. The fly, who sees Bindu grieving Nani's demise in her room, uncovers itself to be Nani by composing on the work area with her tears. It passes on the conditions of Nani's demise to Bindu, and they unite against Sudeep. The last's fixation on the fly influences his expert and individual life.

One day when making a trip to work, an eve mystery annoys her; Nani, again reawakened as a fly, assaults him with a needle before reporting his arrival. 

The young lady is awed with the tale of the fly her dad describes. 

The thought for "Eega" started in the late 1990s in screenwriter K. V. Vijayendra Prasad mind. Around then, he was kidding about a housefly looking for retribution on a human in a discussion with his child S. S. Rajamouli. Prasad later built up the thought as a content for an English-language film set in 1830s America, in which an African-American kid kicks the bucket trying to free his family from bondage and is resurrected as a fly. In the wake of finishing "Maryada Ramanna" (2010), Rajamouli reexamined the idea subsequent to considering coordinating a film that was particular from some other. He chose to make "Eega" a bilingual film in Telugu and TamilÂ â every scene including discourse was shot twice, once for every language. The Tamil form, titled "Naan Ee", was Rajamouli's directorial debut in Tamil film. The film was displayed by Daggubati Suresh Babu of Suresh Productions. 

Without precedent for his profession, Rajamouli started throwing after the content was finished in light of the fact that he felt the story required on-screen characters who were reasonable for the jobs. Nani, the hero, was the first of the three of the primary cast individuals to be picked; he finished recording his scenes in 25 days. Samantha Ruth Prabhu, the second performing artist cast, was marked as the female lead. Rajamouli picked Sudeep to play the fly's human enemy in the wake of being inspired with the on-screen character's execution in "Rann" (2010), and give rapper Noel Sean a role as Nani's companion in the film. Sudeep drew motivation for his job as the lowlife from the 1983 Kannada film "Bhakta Prahlada"; he was depicting a character he viewed as a "miscreant" with "dim shades" as opposed to a rival. 

The content was doctored by Rajamouli's sibling, S. S. Kanchi, while Janardhan Maharshi and Crazy Mohan composed the exchange for the Telugu and Tamil forms individually, denoting their first coordinated effort with Rajamouli. James Fowlds was at first picked as the movie's executive of photography, however was supplanted by K. K. Senthil Kumar because of inventive contrasts and planning clashes. M. M. Keeravani formed the movie's soundtrack and score, Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao altered the movie, Ravinder Reddy was its specialty chief, and Rajamouli's significant other Rama chipped away at the outfit plan. 

Creation of the film started with a formal dispatch function on 7 December 2010 in Hyderabad. The first form was recorded over a six-month time frame and cost about 110 million; Rajamouli felt the nature of the material was poor and begun once more. The film's last spending plan was evaluated at somewhere in the range of 260 and 400 million. 

Key photography started on 22 February 2011 in Hyderabad; 90% of the film was shot at Ramanaidu Studios in the city. An arrangement was recorded at Sri Sita Ramachandra Swamy Temple in Ammapally close Shamshabad, toward the beginning of March 2011. Scenes with Nani, Samantha, and Sudeep were taped amid the main shooting plan, which was finished on 16 March. Shooting was upset in April by a continuous work question between film laborers and makers. Rajamouli considered moving "Eega" out of Hyderabad if the strike proceeded. Recording proceeded in Kokapet toward the beginning of September 2011, and key photography was finished in late February 2012 as after generation started. 

As indicated by Rajamouli, the film unit counseled a 3D video of the storyboard before shooting a scene every day. After the shooting of every scene was finished, the altering and re-recording systems were finished with basic greyscale liveliness. An Arri Alexa camera, a prime focal point, and Scorpio and Strada cranes were utilized for the foremost photography, while a test focal point and high-force lighting were utilized for the full scale photography. Senthil Kumar needed to utilize an uncommon focal point with a base f-stop of f8.0; the wide gaps required high-power lighting to get satisfactory shots. He utilized GoPro cameras as they were the littlest conceivable ones that offered near proficient goals. Ghost Cam was utilized to film outrageous moderate movement arrangements; certain scenes were shot at 2,000 edges for each second. 

Advanced middle of the road (DI) was led at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad. A top of the line DI framework was imported and the procedure took a half year to finish. Vocalist Chinmayi, who named for Samantha in "Eega", found the procedure troublesome in light of the fact that the recording did not contain the vivified fly. Rajamouli drew closer Anuj Gurwara to compose the exchange for the Hindi-named variant titled "Makkhi". The Hindi naming started in Hyderabad, and Gurwara named for Nani in the film. Ajay Devgan and his significant other Kajol, going about as guardians recounting to the film's story to their tyke at sleep time, gave voiceovers amid the opening credits of "Makkhi". The visuals going with the end credits were adjusted to demonstrate the fly imitating the shenanigans of Devgan, Salman Khan, and Akshay Kumar. 

R. C. Kamalakannan and Pete Draper of Makuta VFX administered "Eega" special visualizations, and Rahul Venugopal was the film's set chief and matte painter. V. Srinivas Mohan, who later teamed up with Rajamouli on "", chipped away at a short arrangement for the film. Rajamouli wanted to finish chip away at the fly symbolism in four months, yet it took fourteen. 

90% of the activity related work was done in Hyderabad; the staying 10% was finished in the United States. In an Indo-Asian News Service talk with, Draper said he worked together with thirteen specialists and a huge group of illustrators to structure the fly. Since the film's fly's eyes include 80 percent of its face, Rajamouli felt they could make it expressive; he utilized the 1986 Pixar American short film "Luxo Jr." for motivation. The yield of the primary group of illustrators, utilizing the reference material arranged, was inadmissible and Rajamouli modified the fly's enumerating. Utilizing an incredible focal point, the film group led a challenging photographic shoot of oblivious flies in a jug put away in a fridge. In the wake of amplifying the subtleties, Rajamouli rolled out restorative improvements to the fly's face to make it look engaging onscreen. Another group including Draper, three idea craftsmen, three modelers, two shader originators, two hair and hide creators, three riggers and a few artists, planned the energized fly in two months. Its head and hide were planned in the wake of molding its body and wings. The fly was refined day by day utilizing mud models to assist the procedure. The illustrators found the arrangements among Sudeep and the fly substantially more hard to execute in light of the fact that the last needed to express feelings just however its slim arms as opposed to its face. 

A portion of the embellishments couldn't be planned in India, so Makuta VFX connected with movement specialists in Armenia, China, Iran, Israel, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The organization's 30-part group experienced a preparation program on acting hypothesis and creepy crawly arranges. "Eega" is the main Indian film to utilize PC created symbolism for almost an hour and a half of its length; the film had 2,234 real life liveliness shots. By mid-June 2012 Rajamouli had endorsed 1,970 shots; the last form was appeared to the film unit after the endorsement of 226 pending shots. The special visualizations cost an expected 70 million. 

The film's primary topic is retribution; the spirit of a killed man is resurrected as a fly and looks for vengeance against his executioner. Rajamouli recognized a few likenesses to David Cronenberg "The Fly" (1986), in which a researcher turns into a fly when his investigation breakdowns, and thought of "Eega" as a "socio-dream" as opposed to a sci-fi film. At a gathering with understudies at the Annapurna International School of Film and Media Campus (AIFSM), he analyzed the fight between the fly and Sudeep, which the dark horse fly successes, to David triumph over Goliath and India's triumph in the 1983 Cricket World Cup. Insane Mohan contrasted the film and "Apoorva Sagodharargal" (1989), a vengeance show whose hero Appu (Kamal Haasan) is a midget. 

Mohan told Malathi Rangarajan of "The Hindu" that despite the fact that the film's content may look like those of "Stuart Little" (1999) and "Shrek" (2001), the utilization of the predicament of somebody tormented by a housefly was a unique thought. As indicated by Tamil film antiquarian and performing artist Mohan Raman, "Naan Ee"unlike the creature focused movies "Nalla Neram" (1972) and "Neeya?" (1979)lacks a human hero. Film pundit Baradwaj Rangan discovered "Eega" hero sensible, as opposed to the ones in the energized movies by the Walt Disney Company, aside from when it shows a couple of human attributes. "Early afternoon" thought about "Eega" to "Cockroach" (2010), an Australian short film about a man who is resurrected as a cockroach after he is unintentionally killed on his big day. 

The film's optional topic is the survival of affection past death. Rangan has compared "Eega" to a phantom film in light of the fact that a dead hero comes back to his friends and family as a harried soul. Malini Mannath of "The New Indian Express" found the scene where the fly thwarts Sudeep's endeavor to draw near to Bindu reminiscent of one in the film "Apparition" (1990). Mayank Shekhar reprimanded the connection between the lead pair, which he said advocates stalking as an acknowledged type of sentiment. Malathi Rangarajan said the foe took the "outrageous advance" of killing the saint right off the bat in the film, interestingly with the clichÃ© opponent whose desire for the female lead has quite recently started and undermines the legend. 

Remarking on the use of Tantrism, "The New Indian Express" Kruthi Grover found the demise of the alchemist like the tale of Bhasmasur, an evil presence in Indian folklore to whom Shiva enables to decrease an individual to fiery remains by contacting her or his head. At the point when Bhasmasur attempts to contact Shiva's head, Vishnu accept the type of Mohini and makes Bhasmasur contact his own head, executing him. As indicated by Malathi Rangarajan, the movie's topics of Tantrism and dark enchantment are reminiscent of the utilization of the mysterious as a plot gadget in movies coordinated by B. Vittalacharya. 

The soundtracks of "Eega" and "Naan Ee", each comprising of five songsone of which is a remixed rendition of the film's title tuneâwere made by M. M. Keeravani. Keeravani said in light of the fact that the film's subject of vengeance and the hero (a housefly) are general ideas, his "just test" was guaranteeing the music did not have a "particular ethnic or territorial flavor" and "request". He consolidated the humming sound made by flies into the score and misrepresented or diminished it as indicated by a scene's passionate nature. Rajamouli drew nearer Madhan Karky to compose the verses for "Naan Ee" soundtrack after the arrival of "Enthiran" (2010), clarifying the significance of every tune in the film's account. Just as giving point by point profiles of the characters, Rajamouli ordered a couple of scenes, which helped Karky compose the verses.
