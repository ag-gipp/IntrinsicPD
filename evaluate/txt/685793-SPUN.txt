Following Band Aid's 1984 "Do They Know It's Christmas?" venture in the United Kingdom, a thought for the production of an American advantage single for African starvation alleviation originated from extremist Harry Belafonte, who, alongside pledge drive Ken Kragen, was instrumental in conveying the vision to the real world. A few artists were reached by the pair, before Jackson and Richie were allocated the assignment of composing the tune. The couple finished the composition of "We Are the World" seven weeks after the arrival of "Do They Know It's Christmas?", and one night before the melody's first account session, on January 21, 1985. The memorable occasion united probably the most acclaimed specialists in the music business at the time. 

The tune was discharged on March 7, 1985, as the principal single from the collection. An overall business achievement, it topped music diagrams all through the world and turned into the quickest selling American pop single ever. The primary ever single to be guaranteed multi-platinum, "We Are the World" got a Quadruple Platinum confirmation by the Recording Industry Association of America. 

Granted various distinctionsâincluding three Grammy Awards, one American Music Award, and a People's Choice Awardâthe tune was advanced with a fundamentally gotten music video, a home video, an extraordinary version magazine, a simulcast, and a few books, blurbs, and shirts. The advancement and stock supported the achievement of "We Are the World" and raised over $63Â million (identical to $ million today) for compassionate guide in Africa and the US. 

Following the destruction brought about by the greatness 7.0 M quake in Haiti on January 12, 2010, a revamp of the melody by another elite player cast of vocalists was recorded on February 1, 2010. Entitled "We Are the World 25 for Haiti", it was discharged as a solitary on February 12, 2010, and continues from the record helped survivors in the devastated nation. 

Before the composition of "We Are the World", American performer and social extremist Harry Belafonte had thought for quite a while to have a melody recorded by the most popular craftsmen in the music business at the time. He intended to have the returns given to another association called United Support of Artists for Africa (USA for Africa). The non-benefit establishment would then bolster and alleviate starving individuals in Africa, explicitly Ethiopia, where around one million individuals kicked the bucket amid the nation's 1983â 1985 starvation. The thought pursued Band Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas?" venture in the UK, which Belafonte had caught wind of. He additionally arranged cash to be put aside to help take out craving in the United States of America. Stimulation administrator and individual pledge drive Ken Kragen was reached by Belafonte, who requested artists Lionel Richie and Kenny RogersâKragen's customersâto partake in Belafonte's melodic undertaking. Kragen and the two performers consented to help with Belafonte's main goal, and thus, enrolled the collaboration of Stevie Wonder, to include more "name esteem" to their task. Quincy Jones was drafted to co-produce the melody, investing significant time from his work on "The Color Purple". Jones likewise called Michael Jackson, who had recently discharged the industrially effective "Spine chiller" collection and had finished up a visit with his siblings. 

Jackson uncovered to Richie that he needed to sing the melody, yet to take an interest in its composition too. In the first place, "We Are the World" was to be composed by Jackson, Richie, and Wonder. As Wonder had constrained time to chip away at the task, Jackson and Richie continued to state "We Are simply the World." They started making the melody at Hayvenhurst, the Jackson family home in Encino. For seven days, the two went through consistently taking a shot at verses and songs in Jackson's room. They realized that they needed a melody that would be anything but difficult to sing and paramount. The pair needed to make a song of devotion. Jackson's more established sister La Toya viewed the two work on the tune, and later battled that Richie just composed a couple of lines for the track. She expressed that her more youthful sibling composed 99 percent of the verses, "yet he's never felt it important to state that". La Toya further remarked on the melody's creation in a meeting with the American big name news magazine "Individuals". "I'd go into the room while they were composing and it would be exceptionally tranquil, which is odd, since Michael's normally lively when he works. It was extremely enthusiastic for them." 

Richie had recorded two tunes for "We Are the World", which Jackson took, adding music and words to the tune around the same time. Jackson expressed, "I adore working rapidly. I proceeded without even Lionel knowing, I couldn't pause. I went in and turned out that night with the melody finishedâdrums, piano, strings, and words to the theme." Jackson at that point displayed his demo to Richie and Jones, who were both stunned; they didn't anticipate that the pop star should see the structure of the tune so rapidly. The following gatherings among Jackson and Richie were unfruitful; the pair did not create any extra vocals and completed no work. It was not until the evening of January 21, 1985, that Richie and Jackson finished the verses and tune of "We Are the World" inside over two hours, one night before the melody's first chronicle session. 

The primary night of account, January 22, 1985, had tight security available, as Richie, Jackson, Wonder, and Jones began take a shot at "We Are the World" at Kenny Rogers' Lion Share Recording Studio. The studio, on Beverly Boulevard in California, was loaded up with performers, professionals, video groups, entourages, aides, and coordinators as the four artists entered. To start the night, a "vocal guide" of "We Are the World" was recorded by Richie and Jackson and copied on tape for every one of the welcomed entertainers. The guide was recorded on the 6th take, as Quincy Jones felt that there was a lot of "thought" in the past adaptations. 

Following their work on the vocal guide, Jackson and Jones started considering options for the line "There's a possibility we're taking, we're ending our very own lives": the pair was worried that the last piece of the line would be viewed as a source of perspective to suicide. As the gathering tuned in to a playback of the chorale, Richie proclaimed that the last piece of the line ought to be changed to "We're 'sparing' our very own lives", which his kindred artists concurred with. Maker Jones additionally proposed modifying the previous piece of the line. "One thing we would prefer not to do, particularly with this gathering, is seem as though we're applauding ourselves. So it's extremely, 'There's a "decision" we're making.'" Around 1:30Â am, the four performers finished the night by completing a theme of melodic vocalizations, including the sound "sha-lum sha-lin-gay". Jones told the gathering that they were not to add whatever else to the tape. "On the off chance that we get excessively great, somebody's going to begin playing it on the radio," he declared. 

On January 24, 1985, following multi day of rest, Jones dispatched Richie and Jackson's vocal manual for the majority of the specialists who might be engaged with "We Are the World"s recording. Encased in the bundle was a letter from Jones, routed to "My Fellow Artists": 

Ken Kragen led a creation meeting at a lodge off Sunset Boulevard on January 25, 1985. There, Kragen and his group examined where the chronicle sessions with the supergroup of artists should occur. He expressed, "The absolute most harming snippet of data is the place we're doing this. In the event that that shows up anyplace, we have a turbulent circumstance that could thoroughly devastate the venture. The minute a Prince, a Michael Jackson, a Bob DylanâI promise you!â drives up and sees a crowd around that studio, he will never come in." On that night, Quincy Jones' partner maker and vocal arranger, Tom Bahler, was given the assignment of coordinating each performance line with the correct voice. Bahler expressed, "It resembles vocal orchestrating ideally." Jones dissented, expressing that the errand resembled "putting a watermelon in a Coke bottle". The next night, Lionel Richie held a "movement" session at his home, where it was chosen who might stand where. 

The last night of chronicle was hung on January 28, 1985, at A&M Recording Studios in Hollywood.

Another report, from the season of "We Are the World's" recording, proposed that the artist did not have any desire to share in the session since coordinator Bob Geldof considered him a "creep". Ruler did, in any case, give a restrictive track, "4 The Tears In Your Eyes", for the "We Are the World" collection. Taking all things together, more than 45 of America's top artists took an interest in the chronicle, and another 50 must be dismissed. After entering the account studio, the performers were welcomed by a sign stuck to the entryway which read, "If it's not too much trouble abandon your self images." were likewise welcomed by Stevie Wonder, who announced that if the chronicle was not finished in one take, he and Ray Charles, two visually impaired men, would drive everyone home. 

Every one of the entertainers took their situation at around 10:30Â pm and started to sing.

Now, Waylon Jennings left the account studio for a brief span when it was recommended by some that the tune be sung in Swahili. A warmed discussion followed, in which a few specialists likewise dismissed the recommendation. The "sha-lum sha-lin-gay" sound kept running into resistance too and was in this manner expelled from the melody. Jennings came back to the studio and took an interest in the account, which bears his name at last credits. The members inevitably chose to sing something significant in English. They sang the new line "One world, Our youngsters", which the greater part of the members delighted in. 

In the early hours of the morning, two Ethiopian ladies, visitors of Stevie Wonder, were brought into the chronicle studioâit had been chosen that a part of the returns raised would be accustomed to convey help to those influenced by the ongoing starvation in Ethiopia. They said thanks to the artists in the interest of their nation, conveying a few craftsmen to tears, before being driven from the room.

Marcus included, "In the domain of contextualization, 'We Are the World' says less regarding Ethiopia than it does about Pepsiâand the genuine outcome will probably be less that specific Ethiopian people will live, or in any case live somewhat longer than they generally would have, than that Pepsi will get the catchphrase of its promoting effort sung for nothing by Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, and all the rest."
