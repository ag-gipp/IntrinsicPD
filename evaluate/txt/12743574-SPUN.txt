Walter Oswald Watt, (11 February 1878Â â 21Â May 1921) was an Australian pilot and agent. The child of a Scottish-Australian vendor and government official, he was conceived in England and moved to Sydney when he was one year old, coming back to Britain at eleven years old for instruction at Bristol and Cambridge. In 1900 he returned to Australia and enrolled in the Militia, before securing dairy cattle stations in New South Wales and Queensland. He was likewise an accomplice in the family sending firm. 

The primary Australian to fit the bill for a Royal Aero Club flying testament, in 1911, Watt joined the French Foreign Legion as a pilot on the episode of World WarÂ I. He exchanged to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) in 1916, rapidly advancing from flight administrator with No.Â 1 Squadron in Egypt to boss of No.Â 2 Squadron on the Western Front. By February 1918, he had been elevated to lieutenant colonel and assumed responsibility for the AFC's first Training Wing in England. 

A beneficiary of France's Legion of Honor and Croix de Guerre, and twice referenced in despatches amid the war, Watt was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1919. He left the military to seek after business interests in Australia, and was praised for his liberality to other returned aviators. In 1921, at the age of forty-three, he passed on by unplanned suffocating at Bilgola Beach, New South Wales. He is recognized by the Oswald Watt Gold Medal for exceptional accomplishment in Australian aeronautics, and the Oswald Watt Fund at the University of Sydney. 

Conceived on 11 February 1878 in Bournemouth, England, Oswald Watt was the most youthful child of John Brown Watt, a Scot who had moved to New South Wales in 1842 and turned into a fruitful shipper and lawmaker, much of the time speaking to his state on abroad missions. Oswald's Australian-conceived mother, Mary Jane, kicked the bucket when he was one and in no time a while later the family migrated to Sydney. Oswald was sent back to England at eleven years old to finish his tutoring at Clifton College, Bristol, before proceeding to learn at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he got a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1899. Coming back to Sydney in 1900, he was authorized as a second lieutenant in the New South Wales Scottish Rifles, a Militia unit, and in 1902 was delegated a confidant to the Governor of New South Wales. On 27Â September that year, he wedded Muriel Williams at St.Â John's Anglican Church in Toorak, Victoria; the couple had one child. 

Watt's family was rich, and he had the capacity to set up himself as a grazier by obtaining a few steers stations in New South Wales and Queensland. Voyaging abroad once more, he acquired his Master of Arts degree from Cambridge in 1904. In October the next year he was elevated to commander in the Scottish Rifles. On an ensuing trek to England he took flying exercises at the Bristol avionics school on Salisbury Plain, where his kindred understudies included Eric Harrison. Watt achieved his Royal Aero Club endorsement, no.Â 112, on 1Â August 1911, turning into the primary Australian resident so qualified. Upon his arrival to Australia soon thereafter, he freely proclaimed that the time was "quickly moving toward when an air corps [would] must be introduced" as a feature of the nation's "military protection plot". 

In March 1912, Watt suggested an area in Canberra close to the Royal Military College, Duntroon, as a base for the Army's proposed Central Flying School. Inferable from its elevation and adjacent bumpy landscape, the site was dismissed by the school's assigned boss, Lieutenant Henry Petre. Petre in the end picked 297 hectares at Point Cook, Victoria, a territory appropriate for seaplanes just as land-based flying machine, to turn into the "origin of Australian military avionics". Watt likewise pushed assembling remote structured flying machine under permit in Australia, however this would not be sought after until after World WarÂ I. In 1913 he was separated on the grounds of "unfortunate behavior" with on-screen character Ivy Schilling, and lost authority of his child in the judgment. He at that point went to Egypt, where he bought and working on flying a BlÃ©riotÂ XI monoplane; while there he met driving French pilots Louis BlÃ©riot and Roland Garros. 

In May 1914, the francophile Watt left Egypt with his plane and took up work at the BlÃ©riot production line and runway in Buc, outside Paris. Terminated by the generally held conviction that Britain would avoid an European clash, Watt offered his administrations and his plane to the French government on 2Â August, the day France proclaimed war on Germany. This signal was invited and he joined the Aviation Militaire segment of the Foreign Legion as a pilot. Despite the fact that he was positioned a conventional fighter, his partners in Bleriot Squadron No.Â 30 alluded to him as ""Capitaine"" in yielding to his past status in the Australian Militia. Presented on Maurice Farman Squadron No.Â 44 in April 1915, he earned the Legion of Honor identification after he and his spectator crash-arrived in a dead zone and prevailing with regards to advancing back to French lines with important insight under exceptional flame from German positions. Before long a short time later, Watt was granted the Croix de Guerreâwith palm leaves by and by exhibited by General Joffreâand elevated to the temporary position of chief. As an outsider, be that as it may, he was not qualified to order a French unit. Watt constantly announced his antipodean association while serving France, painting a kangaroo on the nose of his plane, which he named "Advance Australia". Considered a simple kind, he once acquainted himself with a British pilot with the words "I am an Australian and I haven't got any habits". 

The French perceived that Watt's abilities were not being completely used because of his ineligibility to lead a squadron, and prescribed that he exchange to the Australian Flying Corps. Watt did as such on 1Â March 1916, with the position of skipper. Presented on Egypt in May, he was made leader of BÂ Flight, No.Â 1 Squadron, and assumed responsibility for the unit's first unexpected of Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s the next month. No.Â 1 Squadron was locked in for the most part in ethereal observation and armed force co-task obligations, however the two-situate B.E.2 demonstrated substandard compared to German Fokkers and Rumplers in speed, time-to-climb, and mobility. In September 1916, Watt was elevated to major and given direction of No.Â 2 Squadron, which was shaped in Kantara. He was referenced in despatches by General Archibald Murray, Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, on 13Â October; the tribute was proclaimed in the "London Gazette" on 1Â December. No. 2 Squadron's work force was made to a great extent out of previous Lighthorsemen, just as thirteen mechanics from the Australian Flying Corps' first battle development, the Mesopotamian Half Flight, driven by Flight Sergeant George Mackinolty. Watt actually prepared the power in England initiating in January 1917, preceding sending it toward the Western Front that September. He was "a conceived pioneer of men", as indicated by one officer, while another reviewed that "In the things that made a difference, his men realized he represented supreme dutifulness. They additionally realized that when control could be securely loosened up he would rush to give them some alleviation from the strain." 

In the region of Saint-Quentin on 2Â October, No.Â 2 Squadron turned into the first AFC unit in Europe to see aeronautical battle when one of its watches connected some German two-seaters, which figured out how to get away. Since the AircoÂ DH.5s in the squadron were impeded as contenders by motor issues and low speed, the squadron was utilized for the most part in ground bolster obligations. Amid the Battle of Cambrai that started on 20Â November 1917, Watt drove his pilots on brave low-level besieging and strafing assaults against adversary fortresses and lines of correspondence. Their misfortune rate achieved 30%, however confidence stayed high. In the wake of visiting the squadron, the Royal Flying Corps' Major General Hugh Trenchard portrayed its aviators as "extremely eminent" while Charles Bean, war journalist and future manager of the "Official History of Australia in the War of 1914â 1918", remarked on their "amazingly abnormal state of lead and general tone". Six of Watt's officers were granted the Military Cross for heroism amid the fight, inciting General Sir William Birdwood to send him an individual message of salutation on 16Â December, announcing: "...Â This is to be sure a heavenly record for your squadron, and one of which I am certain everybody of you should properly be amazingly pleased; I question in the event that it has been beaten anywhereÂ ..." By this time, No.Â 2 Squadron had started changing over to Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, however it could accomplish little in the winter a long time because of harsh climate. Watt himself, presently right around forty, was starting to demonstrate the strain of bleeding edge order. Bean discovered him looking "worn" and saw him shuddering even while situated before the wreckage corridor fire. 

In February 1918, Watt was elevated to lieutenant colonel and given direction of the AFC's first Training Wing (Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8 Squadrons) headquartered at Tetbury in Gloucestershire, England; the wing's job was to prepare swap pilots for the four operational AFC squadrons in Palestine and France. Watt proposed moving the wing to France, yet it stayed in England. He was referenced in despatches by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig on 7Â April, and the tribute was gazetted on 28Â May. Not long after the finish of threats in November 1918, author William John Locke visited first Training Wing and found that "there was not one [of Watt's men] whoÂ ...Â did not trust to me his pride in serving under a pioneer so recognized". A pilot later opined that just as having "strength, assurance, and a gigantic limit with regards to work", Watt had "the best factor in administration, a virtuoso for charming himself (without cognizant exertion) to all who served under him". 

Watt was selected an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 1Â January 1919, in acknowledgment of his war administration. He came back to Australia on 6Â May with the remainder of first Training Wing's faculty, on board the troopship "Kaisar-I-Hind", on which he was the positioning officer. Leaving the AFC soon a short time later, he was chosen leader of the New South Wales segment of the Australian Aero Club. He additionally filled in as senior agent on a panel of veteran military pilots inspecting applications for arrangement to a proposed autonomous Australian air administration. Watt was regarded as a man who did not overlook old friends, furnishing previous AFC individuals with money related guide and helping them restore themselves in regular citizen life. He kept up an enthusiasm for business flying however denied an idea to take up the situation of controller of common aeronautics in 1920 inferable from his business advantages, which included organization in the family delivering firm of Gilchrist, Watt and Sanderson Ltd, and directorships of mining, elastic, and workmanship enterprises. He likewise turned down solicitations to represent parliament, and to join the youngster Royal Australian Air Force. 

Oswald Watt suffocated at Bilgola Beach, close Newport, New South Wales, on 21Â May 1921. Cuts and wounding on his body demonstrated that he had slipped on rocks, struck his head, and folded oblivious into moderately shallow water. Made due by his 15-year-old child, he was agreed a military burial service two days after the fact at St Jude's Church, Randwick. Individuals from the AFC, Royal Air Force, and Australian Aero Club shaped a watchman of respect at the administration, one of the biggest in the suburb's history, which likewise included agents of the Royal Australian Navy and Australian Army. Among the tributes was a botanical wreath from an unknown gathering of French admirers, and another that was dropped by parachute from a low-flying plane. On 31Â May, Watt's body was incinerated and his powder entombed in the family vault at St Jude's. 

In his will, Watt left two endowments to the Australian Aero Club, one of which was utilized to build up the Oswald Watt Gold Medal for exceptional accomplishment in Australian avionics. Victors of the honor have included Charles Kingsford Smith, Bert Hinkler, Henry Millicer, Ivor McIntyre, Jon Johanson and Andy Thomas. He likewise handed down a whole to the Royal Military College, Duntroon, to grant every year a lot of binoculars for the best cadet paper on military flight or aviation. The honor was established as the Oswald Watt Prize later in 1921. The majority of the buildup of Watt's home went to the University of Sydney. Thought about one of the college's incredible sponsors, he was honored by the Oswald Watt Fund. In May 1923, the Oswald Watt Wing of the Havilah Home for Orphans, Wahroonga, was opened by the Governor-General of Australia. Watt was recognized as both a source and a commentator by F.M. Cutlack in the last's volume on the Australian Flying Corps that was first distributed in 1923 as a component of the "Official History of Australia in the War of 1914â 1918". Amid World War I, Oswald Watt had been the main AFC officer to order a wing separated from Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams, who was later to end up known as the "Father of the RAAF". In 2001, military student of history Alan Stephens noticed that "had destiny attracted him to a post-war vocation in the Air Force rather than to business and an awkward demise, 'Toby' Watt may have tested Richard Williams as the RAAF's prevailing figure in its developmental years".
