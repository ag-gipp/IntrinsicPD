Moe Berg 

Morris Berg (March 2, 1902 â May 29, 1972) was an American catcher and mentor in Major League Baseball, who later filled in as a government agent for the Office of Strategic Services amid World War II. In spite of the fact that he played 15 seasons in the significant classes, essentially for four American League groups, Berg was never in excess of a normal player, typically utilized as a reinforcement catcher, and was better known for being "the brainiest person in baseball" than for anything he achieved in the diversion. Casey Stengel once depicted Berg as "the most abnormal man ever to play baseball". 

An alum of Princeton University and Columbia Law School, Berg talked a few dialects and routinely perused 10 papers every day. His notoriety was powered by his fruitful appearances as a contender on the radio test show "Data, Please", in which he responded to inquiries concerning the derivation of words and names from Greek and Latin, authentic occasions in Europe and the Far East, and progressing worldwide gatherings. 

As a covert agent working for the legislature of the United States, Berg made a trip to Yugoslavia to assemble knowledge on obstruction bunches the U.S. government was thinking about supporting. He was then sent set for Italy, where he met different physicists concerning the Nazi German atomic program. After the war, Berg was every so often utilized by the OSS's successor, the Central Intelligence Agency, in any case, by the mid-1950s, was jobless. He went through the most recent two many years of his existence without work, living with different kin. 

Berg was the third and last offspring of Bernard Berg, a drug specialist, and Rose (Tashker), a homemaker, both Jewish, who lived in the Harlem area of New York City, a couple of squares from the Polo Grounds arena. At the point when Berg was three and a half, he asked his mom to give him a chance to begin school. In 1906, Bernard Berg purchased a drug store in West Newark. In 1910 the Berg family moved once more, to the Roseville segment of Newark. Roseville offered Bernard Berg all that he needed in an areaâdecent schools, white collar class inhabitants, and not many Jews. 

Berg started playing baseball at seven years old for the Roseville Methodist Episcopal Church baseball crew under the less ethnic pen name Wolfe. In 1918, at 16 years old, Berg moved on from Barringer High School. Amid his senior season, the "Newark Star-Eagle" chose a nine-man "dream group" for 1918 from the city's best prep and open secondary school baseball players, and Berg was named the group's third baseman. Barringer was the first in a progression of foundations Berg participated in his life where his religion made him uncommon. The greater part of different understudies were East Side Italian Catholics or Protestants from Forest Hill, however there were relatively few Jews, similarly as Bernard needed it. 

In the wake of moving on from Barringer, Berg took on New York University. He burned through two semesters there and played baseball and ball. In 1919 he exchanged to Princeton University and never again referenced that he had gone to NYU for a year, introducing himself solely as a Princeton man. Berg got a B.A., "magna cum laude" in current dialects. He had examined seven dialects: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Sanskrit, concentrating with the philologist Harold H. Drinking spree. His Jewish legacy and unassuming accounts consolidated to keep him on the edges of Princeton society, where he never fully fit in. 

Amid his first year, Berg played a respectable starting point on an undefeated group. Starting in his sophomore year, he was the beginning shortstop. He was not an extraordinary hitter and was a moderate baserunner, however he had a solid, precise tossing arm and sound baseball impulses. In his senior season, he was skipper of the group and had a .337 batting normal, batting .611 against Princeton's most despised opponents, Harvard and Yale. Berg and Crossan Cooper, Princeton's second baseman, conveyed plays in Latin when there was a contradicting player on a respectable halfway point. 

On June 26, 1923, Yale vanquished Princeton 5â 1 at Yankee Stadium to win the Big Three title. Berg had an exceptional day, getting two hits in four at bats (2â 4) with a solitary and a twofold, and making a few radiant plays at shortstop. Both the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Robins ("i.e.", Dodgers) wanted "Jewish blood" on their groups, to speak to the huge Jewish people group in New York, and communicated enthusiasm for Berg. The Giants were particularly intrigued, yet they previously had two future Hall of Famers at shortstop, Dave "Magnificence" Bancroft and Travis Jackson. The Robins were an unremarkable group, on which Berg would have a superior opportunity to play. On June 27, 1923, Berg marked his first major alliance contract for $5,000 ($ today) with the Robins. 

Berg's first diversion with the Robins went ahead June 27, 1923, against the Philadelphia Phillies at the Baker Bowl. Berg came in toward the beginning of the seventh inning, supplanting Ivy Olson at shortstop, when the Robins were winning 13â 4. Berg took care of five possibilities without a blunder, and got a line drive to begin a diversion finishing twofold play. He got a hit in two at bats, singling up the center against Clarence Mitchell, and scoring a run. For the season, Berg batted .187 and made 21 mistakes in 47 diversions, his solitary National League understanding. 

After the season finished, Berg took his first trek abroad, cruising from New York to Paris. He settled in the Latin Quarter in a condo that disregarded the Sorbonne, where he joined up with 32 distinct classes. In Paris he built up a propensity he kept for a mind-blowing remainder: perusing a few papers every day. Until Berg wrapped up a paper, he thought of it as "alive" and would not let any other person contact it. When he was done with it, he would consider the paper "dead" and anyone could peruse it. In January 1924, rather than making a beeline for New York and getting himself into shape for the up and coming baseball season, Berg visited Italy and Switzerland. 

Amid spring preparing at the Robins office in Clearwater, Florida, chief Wilbert Robinson could see that Berg's hitting had not improved, and optioned him to the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. Berg did not take the downgrade well and took steps to stop baseball, yet by mid-April he answered to the Millers. Berg did great once he turned into the Millers' customary third baseman, hitting near .330, yet in July his normal dove and he was back on the seat. On August 19, 1924, Berg was loaned to the Toledo Mud Hens, a poor group attacked by wounds. Berg was quickly embedded into the lineup at shortstop when Rabbit Helgeth would not pay a $10 ($ today) fine for poor play and was suspended. Significant class scout Mike GonzÃ¡lez sent a message to the Dodgers assessing Berg with the terse, however at this point renowned, line, "Great field, no hit." Berg completed the season with a .264 normal. 

By April 1925, he was beginning to demonstrate guarantee as a hitter with the Reading Keystones of the International League. In view of his .311 batting normal and 124 runs batted in, the Chicago White Sox practiced their choice they had with Reading, paying $6,000 ($ today) for him, and moved Berg up to the major classes the next year. 

The 1926 season started with Berg educating the White Sox that he would skip spring preparing and the initial two months of the period to finish his first year at Columbia Law School, and Berg did not join the White Sox until May 28. Bill Hunnefield was marked by the White Sox to have Berg's spot at shortstop, and was having an exceptionally decent year, batting more than .300. Berg played in just 41 diversions, batting .221. 

Berg came back to Columbia Law School after the season to keep concentrating for his law degree. Notwithstanding White Sox proprietor Charles Comiskey offering him more cash to come to spring preparing, Berg declined, and educated the White Sox that he would report late for the 1927 season. Noel Dowling, an educator to whom Berg clarified his circumstance, advised Berg to take additional classes in the fall, and said that he would organize with the senior member a time away from graduate school the next year, 1928. 

Since he announced late, Berg went through the initial three months of the period on the seat. In August, a progression of wounds to catchers Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy, and Buck Crouse left the White Sox needing someone to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/director, chose Berg, who completed a fine employment filling in. Schalk masterminded previous Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the group at their next amusement, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was fat to the point that pitcher Ted Lyons would not pitch to him. At the point when Schalk asked him whom he needed to get, Lyons chose Berg. 

In Berg's presentation as a beginning catcher, he needed to stress over getting Lyons' knuckleball, yet in addition about confronting the Yankees' Murderers' Row lineup, which included Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Earle Combs. Lyons beat the Yankees 6â 3, holding Ruth hitless. Berg made the guarded play of the diversion when he got a poor toss from the outfield, spun and labeled out Joe Dugan at the plate. He found eight additional occasions amid the last month and a half of the period. 

To get ready for the 1928 season, Berg went up to a timber camp in New York's Adirondack Mountains three weeks before answering to the White Sox spring preparing office in Shreveport, Louisiana. The hard work did ponders for him, as he answered to spring preparing on March 2, 1928, fit as a fiddle. Before the finish of the period, Berg had set up himself as the beginning catcher. In 1928, he drove all AL catchers in got taking rate (60.9), was third in the AL in twofold plays by a catcher, with 8, and fifth in the American League in helps by a catcher, with 52. At the plate, he batted .246 with a vocation high 16 duplicates. 

At graduate school, Berg fizzled Evidence and did not graduate with the class of 1929, yet he passed the New York State law student review. He rehashed the proof course the next year, and on February 26, 1930, got his LL.B. On April 6, amid a display amusement against the Little Rock Travelers, his spikes got in the dirt as he attempted to change bearings and he tore a knee tendon. In 1929, he was second in the American League in both twofold plays by a catcher (12) and helps by a catcher (86), got the third-most endeavored base stealers in the group (41), and was fourth in the alliance in got taking rate (47.7%). He had maybe his best season with the bat, hitting .287 with 47 RBIs. 

He was back in the beginning lineup on May 23, 1930, however his knee would not enable him to play each day. He played in just 20 amusements the entire season and completed with a .115 batting normal. Amid the winter, he accepted a position with the regarded Wall Street law office Satterlee and Canfield (presently Satterlee, Stephens, Burke and Burke). 

The Cleveland Indians lifted him up on April 2, 1931, when Chicago put him on waivers, yet he played in just 10 amusements with 13 at-bats and just 1 hit for the whole season. 

The Indians gave him his genuine discharge in January 1932, however with catchers difficult to find, Clark Griffith, proprietor of the Washington Senators, welcomed him to spring preparing in Biloxi, Mississippi. He made the group, playing in 75 amusements while not submitting a blunder, and was second in the AL in twofold plays by a catcher, with 9, and in got taking rate, at 54.3%. When beginning catcher Roy Spencer ran down with damage, Berg ventured in, tossing out 35 baserunners while batting .236. 

Resigned ballplayer Herb Hunter organized three players, Berg, Lefty O'Doul, and Ted Lyons, to go to Japan to show baseball workshops at Japanese colleges amid the winter of 1932. On October 22, 1932, the gathering of three players started their circuit of Meiji, Waseda, Rikkyo, Todai (Tokyo Imperial), Hosei, and Keio colleges, the individuals from the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League. At the point when different Americans came back to the United States after their training assignments were finished, Berg remained behind to investigate Japan. He proceeded to visit Manchuria, Shanghai, Peking, Indochina, Siam, India, Egypt and Berlin. 

Notwithstanding his longing to return to Japan, Berg answered to the Senators preparing camp on February 26, 1933, in Biloxi. He played in only 40 diversions amid the season, and batted just .185. The Senators won the flag, however lost to the Giants in the World Series. Bluff Bolton, the Senators' beginning catcher in 1933, requested more cash in 1934. At the point when the Senators would not pay him more, he sat out and Berg landed the beginning position. On April 22, Berg made a blunder, his first handling mix-up since 1932âan American League record of 117 continuous errorless diversions. On July 25, the Senators gave Berg his genuine discharge. He before long came back to the major classes, in any case, after Cleveland Indians catcher Glenn Myatt broke his lower leg on August 1. Indians director Walter Johnson, who had overseen Berg in 1932, offered Berg the hold getting work. Berg played sporadically until Frankie Pytlak, Cleveland's beginning catcher, harmed himself, and Berg turned into the beginning catcher. 

Herb Hunter orchestrated a gathering of All-Stars, including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Earl Averill, Charlie Gehringer, Jimmie Foxx, and Lefty Gomez, to visit Japan playing displays against a Japanese elite player group. In spite of the way that Berg was an average, third-string catcher, he was welcomed finally to make the outing. Among the things Berg took with him to Japan were a 16-mm Bell and Howell motion picture camera and a letter from MovietoneNews, a New York City newsreel generation organization with which Berg had contracted to film the sights of his excursion. At the point when the group touched base in Japan, he gave an appreciated discourse in Japanese and furthermore tended to the governing body. 

On November 29, 1934, while the remainder of the group was playing in Omiya, Berg went to Saint Luke's Hospital in Tsukiji, apparently to visit the girl of American Ambassador Joseph Grew. Rather, Berg sneaked onto the top of the emergency clinic, one of the tallest structures in Tokyo, and taped the city and harbor with his motion picture camera, furnishing American insight with uncommon photographs of the city. He never saw the minister's little girl. Back at home, the Indians gave him his unrestricted discharge. Berg proceeded to the Philippines, Korea, and Moscow. 

After his arrival to America, Berg was grabbed by the Boston Red Sox. In his five seasons with the Red Sox, Berg arrived at the midpoint of less than 30 recreations a season. On February 21, 1939, Berg showed up on the radio test appear, "Data, Please". Berg put on a stunning act. Of his appearance, Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis let him know, "Berg, in only thirty minutes you helped out baseball than I've done the whole time I've been magistrate". On his third appearance, Clifton Fadiman, the mediator, began asking Berg such a large number of individual inquiries. Berg did not respond to any more inquiries and never showed up on the show again. Customary show visitor and sportswriter John Kieran later said that "Moe was the most academic expert competitor (I) at any point knew." After his playing profession finished, Berg was a Red Sox mentor in 1940 and 1941. Berg punctuated his vocation in baseball with "Pitchers and Catchers," a broadly respected valedictory article on the importance and playing of the amusement, in the September 1941 issue of "The Atlantic Monthly". A 2018 profile of Berg in "The New York Times" portrayed the article as, "still a standout amongst the most sagacious works at any point wrote about the diversion." 

With the assault on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese on December 7, 1941, the United States was pushed into World War II. To do his part for the war exertion, Berg acknowledged a situation with Nelson Rockefeller's Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs on January 5, 1942. After nine days, his dad, Bernard, passed on. Amid the late spring of 1942, Berg screened the recording he shot of Tokyo Bay for insight officers of the United States military. The film may have helped Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle plan his celebrated Doolittle Raid, in spite of the fact that this course of events might be conflicting, as the Doolittle Raid happened before summer, on April 18, 1942. 

From August 1942 to February 1943, Berg was on task in the Caribbean and South America. His activity was to screen the wellbeing and physical wellness of the American troops positioned there. Berg, alongside a few other OIAA operators, left in June 1943 in light of the fact that they thought South America presented little risk to the United States, and they needed to be somewhere where their gifts would be put to all the more likely use. 

On August 2, 1943, Berg acknowledged a situation with the Office of Strategic Services Special Operations Branch (SO) for a compensation of $3,800 ($ today) a year. He was a paramilitary tasks officer in the piece of the OSS that is currently called the CIA Special Activities Division. In September, he was doled out to the OSS Secret Intelligence branch (SI), and given a spot on the OSS SI Balkans work area. In this job, he parachuted into involved Yugoslavia to assess the different opposition bunches working against the Nazis to figure out which was the most grounded. He conversed with both DraÅ¾a MihailoviÄ and Tito and investigated their powers, choosing that Tito had the more grounded and better upheld gathering. His assessments were utilized to help decide the measure of help and help to give each gathering. In late 1943, Berg was allocated to Project Larson, an OSS task set up by OSS Chief of Special Projects John Shaheen. The expressed reason for the venture was to grab Italian rocket and rocket authorities in Italy and convey them to the U.S. In any case, there was another undertaking covered up inside Larson, called Project AZUSA, with the objective of meeting Italian physicists to perceive what they thought about Werner Heisenberg and Carl Friedrich von WeizsÃ¤cker. It was comparable in extension and mission to the Alsos venture. 

From May to mid-December 1944, Berg jumped around Europe talking with physicists and attempting to persuade a few to leave Europe and work in America. Toward the start of December, news about Heisenberg giving an address in ZÃ¼rich achieved the OSS. Berg was appointed to go to the address and decide "in the event that anything Heisenberg said persuaded him the Germans were near a bomb." If Berg reached the resolution that the Germans were close, he had requests to shoot Heisenberg; Berg established that the Germans were not close. Amid his time in Switzerland, Berg turned out to be dear companions with physicist Paul Scherrer. Berg left the OSS in January 1946. "Mr. Morris Berg, United States Civilian, rendered uncommonly commendable administration of high incentive to the war exertion from April 1944 to January 1946," peruses the Medal of Freedom reference. "In a place of duty in the European Theater, he displayed investigative capacities and a sharp arranging personality. He roused both regard and steady abnormal state of undertaking with respect to his subordinates which empowered his segment to create studies and investigation imperative to the mounting of American tasks." His sister acknowledged it for his sake after his demise. 

In 1951, Berg asked the CIA to send him to Israel. "A Jew must do this", he wrote in his scratch pad. The CIA dismissed Berg's solicitation. In any case, in 1952 Berg was procured by the CIA to utilize his old contacts from World War II to assemble data about the Soviet nuclear bomb venture. For the $10,000 in addition to costs that Berg got, the CIA got nothing. The CIA officer who talked with Berg when he came back from Europe said that he was "flaky". 

For the following 20 years, Berg had no genuine activity, living off companions and relatives who endure him as a result of his mystique. When they approached what he accomplished professionally, he would answer by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the feeling that he was as yet a government agent. A deep rooted single man, he lived with his sibling Samuel for a long time. As per Samuel, he wound up testy and snappish after the war, and did not appear to think about much in life other than his books. His sibling at long last developed tired of the course of action and asked Moe to leave, and even had expulsion papers drawn up. Subsequent to being removed from his sibling's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he stayed for an amazing remainder. 

He got a bunch of votes in Baseball Hall of Fame casting a ballot (four of every 1958, and five out of 1960). When he was censured for "squandering" his scholarly ability on the game he adored, Berg answered, "I'd preferably be a ballplayer over an equity of the U.S. Preeminent Court". 

Berg got numerous solicitations to compose his journals, yet turned them down. He nearly thought of them in 1960, however he quit after the co-author relegated to work with him mistook him for Moe Howard of the Three Stooges. 

Berg kicked the bucket on May 29, 1972, at 70 years old, from wounds supported in a fall at home. An attendant at the Belleville, New Jersey, medical clinic where he passed on reviewed his last words as: "How did the Mets do today?" (They won.) His remaining parts were incinerated and spread over Mount Scopus in Jerusalem, Israel. 

Berg was enlisted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1996, and the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2000. His is the main baseball card in plain view at the home office of the Central Intelligence Agency. 

American performer Paul Rudd depicted Berg in the true to life film "The Catcher Was a Spy", in light of Nicholas Dawidoff's 1994 life story, The Catcher Was a Spy: The Mysterious Life of Moe Berg. The movie was coordinated by Ben Lewin and got its reality debut on January 19, 2018, at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. 

In 2017, amid the principal period of the true to life arrangement "Virtuoso", which recounts to the account of Albert Einstein, Berg is found in the ninth scene, played by Adam Garcia. 

Berg is the subject of a narrative film by Aviva Kempner, to be discharged in 2019.
