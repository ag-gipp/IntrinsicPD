Round Church, Preslav 

The Round Church (, "Kragla tsarkva"), otherwise called the Golden Church (ÐÐ»Ð°ÑÐ½Ð° ÑÑÑÐºÐ²Ð°, "Zlatna tsarkva") or the Church of St John (ÑÑÑÐºÐ²Ð° "Ð¡Ð²ÐµÑÐ¸ ÐÐ¾Ð°Ð½", "tsarkva "Sveti Yoan""), is an expansive somewhat safeguarded early medieval Eastern Orthodox church. It lies in Preslav, the previous capital of the First Bulgarian Empire, today a town in northeastern Bulgaria. The congregation dates to the mid tenth century, the season of Tsar Simeon I's standard, and was uncovered and first archeologically inspected in 1927â 1928. 

Viewed as a standout amongst the most noteworthy instances of medieval Bulgarian design, the Round Church takes its name from the particular state of one of its three segments, the cella (naos), which is a rotunda that fills in as a position of ceremony. The congregation's plan likewise incorporates a wide chamber and a rectangular passageway zone, or narthex, set apart by two round turrets. 

The congregation has been compared to instances of religious design from the late Roman (Early Christian) period, the Caucasus, and the Carolingian Pre-Romanesque of Charlemagne as a result of its trademark plan, which is essentially not the same as contemporaneous Bulgarian or Byzantine structures. The congregation's elective name, the Golden Church, comes from its conceivable and mainstream distinguishing proof with "another brilliant church" in Preslav referenced in a medieval artistic source. 

The Round Church's rich inside beautification, which utilizes mosaics, earthenware production and marble subtleties, recognizes it from different places of worship in Preslav. Its inside highlights several illustrations delineating boats, fauna, and Christian figures. Medieval engravings on the dividers extend from names of holy people in Byzantine Greek to isolate letters and short messages in the Glagolitic and Cyrillic letters in order. 

Established in 681 as an agnostic state, Bulgaria was formally Christianised by Byzantine church during the 860s, under Prince Boris (r. 852â 889). The privilege to change over Bulgaria to Christianity was the subject of a political question among Byzantium and the Papacy. With the transformation to Christianity, Boris would have liked to comprehend interior ethnic issues and improve the remote relations of his state, which was not treated similarly by the Christian leaders of Europe. 

The Round Church was developed amid the standard of Boris' child and successor, Simeon (r. 893â 927), whose fruitful crusades set up Bulgaria's impermanent prevalence over Byzantium, on occasion compromising the Byzantine capital at Constantinople. He broadened the region of the First Bulgarian Empire over the greater part of the Balkans, to the Adriatic and the Aegean. Simeon additionally vanquished the grounds of present day Serbia and Montenegro and productively dispensed with the Magyar danger from the north. Considered as a part of Bulgaria's most noteworthy pioneers, Simeon was an advocate of writing and human expressions; his rule is considered the "Brilliant Age" of medieval Bulgarian culture as a result of Bulgaria's abstract impact over contemporary Slavic Europe. 

The city of Preslav was made the capital of Bulgaria right off the bat in Simeon's rule, halfway in light of the previous capital Pliska's relationship with pre-Christian agnosticism. Simeon transformed Preslav into a social focus, a genuine opponent to Constantinople. Probably the most prominent researchers of Bulgaria's Golden Age worked at the Preslav Literary School. Planned more as a regal living arrangement and a grandstand of social power than a fortification, the city flaunted noteworthy engineering, including countless royal residences and many houses of worship. Among them the Round Church, viewed as "a standout amongst the most amazing landmarks of medieval Bulgarian design" and a "statement of the most elevated accomplishments of Old Bulgarian culture", emerged. 

The Round Church is famously related to the "new brilliant church" referenced in a colophon to an Old Bulgarian interpretation of Athanasius of Alexandria's "Discourses Against the Arians". The content says that the interpretation was done on the request of Prince Simeon by Constantine of Preslav and duplicated by Theodore Dox, "at the mouth of the Ticha in the [Byzantine] year 6415 indiction 14 [907Â AD], where a similar ruler had the heavenly new brilliant church constructed". It is questionable whether the "mouth of the Ticha" alludes to a thin area of the stream, to the Ustie go close to the city, or potentially to a specific area beside the external city dividers and in the immediate region of the Round Church ruins. This issue aside, if "brilliant" is to be taken actually, the source is likewise vague with respect to whether the congregation is the upgraded one among the city's brilliant houses of worship, or the single brilliant one among the new chapels in Preslav. Researcher Stancho Vaklinov considers the recognizable proof of the Round Church as the "new brilliant church" from writing "incontestable", while craftsmanship student of history Nikola Mavrodinov is of the sentiment that it is plausible. Then again, student of history A. P. Vlasto trusts this recognizable proof to be "not sure beyond a shadow of a doubt". 

In the event that the congregation from the minor note is likened with the Round Church, at that point it very well may be indisputably dated to close to a couple of years before 907. While the congregation can be attributed to no later than the tenth century, a few researchers have recommended that it might have been developed legitimately over an a lot prior late Roman basilica because of its out of date plan. A conceivable benefactor ("ktetor") of in any event part of the congregation's development is a high-positioning church official ("chartophylax") named Paul, who is referenced in an engraving inside the congregation. The primary piece of the work was likely supported by Simeon, who may have gone about as a main support. 

There is banter in Bulgarian scholastic circles with respect to whether the congregation was worked as a cloister church or as a different house of prayer. On the off chance that the structures neighboring the congregation are translated as the private piece of a cloister, it was most presumably settled after the development of the Round Church, amid the standard of Tsar Peter I (r. 927â 969). The nonappearance of passageways on these structures on the sides confronting the congregation and the nearness of a vast chamber make it far-fetched. Another contention against the Round Church being a religious community church is its area, detached from different structures yet open to people in general outside the inward city. Researcher Bistra Nikolova thinks of it as a city house of prayer and looks at it in capacity to the Great Basilica in Pliska. Another scientist, Krastyu Miyatev, considers it to be an imperial church of Simeon, however workmanship antiquarian Nikola Mavrodinov and classicist Totyu Totev demand it had a place with a cloister from the earliest starting point. 

The most punctual unearthings of the site were completed in 1927â 1928 by archeologists from the National Archeological Museum in Sofia and the Bulgarian Antiquities Society under the bearing of Yordan Gospodinov. A second exertion headed by Krastyu Miyatev brought about a significantly more inside and out examination, and archeological research at the site is progressing. In 1927, the Round Church, alongside the total of medieval Preslav, was announced a chronicled and archeological save and put under state security as a national relic. In 1970, it was separately incorporated into the rundown of landmarks of culture of national significance with a distribution in that year's "State Gazette", issue 46. As a feature of the Veliki Preslav structural hold, the Round Church is recorded as No. 98 among the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria. 

The Church of St Petka in Ruse, opened in 1944, was worked as a remaking of the Round Church in Preslav. The Round Church experienced halfway reclamation in the late 1990s and mid 2000s. In December 2009, plans were reported to reproduce the congregation completely, without annihilating or modifying any of the first auxiliary remains. A landmark committed to Tsar Simeon was divulged in the prompt region of the Round Church on 27 May 2007 to respect the 1080th commemoration of his passing. In spite of not being a functioning church, it is consistently utilized for immersions and weddings. 

The Round Church was worked outside Preslav's internal city, which for the most part incorporated the imperial castle and its related structures, for example, the Royal Basilica. It was still inside the external city points of confinement, and lay in Preslav's southeastern part, some from the South Gate of the internal city. It was arranged on a high patio. Today the Round Church, alongside different vestiges of medieval Preslav, lie not a long way from the advanced town of Veliki Preslav, which is the authoritative focus of a district in Shumen Province, northeastern Bulgaria. 

While no congregation from this age in the Slavic-populated pieces of the Balkans was in the know regarding contemporary Byzantine engineering, the Round Church varies especially in light of its unified, roundabout arrangement, which is one of a kind in medieval Bulgarian design. The adjusted and dynamic nature of its shapes is interestingly with the sharp rectangular structures of that period. It is undoubtedly founded on the bottomless instances recently Roman or early Byzantine structures that lay demolished in the Bulgarian terrains. The design, especially the rotunda, takes after holy places from the season of Justinian I, for example, the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, the Little Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (today Istanbul), and the Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki. Regardless of whether the arrangement is irregular, the innovation and standards utilized in its development are contemporary to the tenth century and as per different landmarks in Preslav. 

Byzantine holy places are by all account not the only wellspring of motivation that specialists credit to the Round Church. A few researchers connect its structure to an Armenian impact, maybe conveyed to Bulgaria by experts from the Caucasus. As a rule, houses of worship with such an obsolete arrangement in the Balkans are related with the movement of Cappadocian, Armenian, or Georgian priests. Another conceivable model for the Round Church in Preslav likely could be found in Carolingian design from the season of Charlemagne, and especially the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, western Germany, with which it shares a few attributes. At the season of the Round Church's development, Bulgaria was in direct contact with the Frankish Empire. One attribute of the Round Church that is asserted by researchers to be an entirely unmistakable Carolingian impact is the nearness of an amazing westwork. 

The Round Church incorporates three segments: the wide chamber (or yard), the narthex and the cella (likewise naos or, because of its shape, rotunda), each filling in as a reason to the next. The areas were not really worked in the meantime, and it is commonly acknowledged that a remaking of the congregation was done some time after its finishing. Mavrodinov and paleontologist Karel Å korpil trust the narthex and cella contained the primary structure time frame, while the chamber was included all around soon after that and by a similar engineer. 

The congregation has an all out length of , including the chamber. It was for the most part worked of rectangular limestone squares sparingly united with mortar. Inside the apse, the mortar is red-hued. The floor was secured by marble and stone tiles stuck over red mortar in the narthex and white mortar somewhere else. Red and yellow blocks and bits of blocks were utilized for the chamber, the curves, and perhaps the arch; some block pieces were utilized to fill spaces between the stones on the dividers. 

The peripheral piece of the Round Church is its chamber, the flanked open space driving into the narthex. It is gotten to by methods for three entryways (one on each divider), of which the passage on the principle west divider is the most detailed and most fantastic in appearance. The chamber is practically square fit as a fiddle and measures . A water well was built in the focal point of the patio; it was connected to a water conductor. 

The sides of the chamber are enriched by a huge number of vaults with docks in the middle. Altogether, there are fourteen vaults: four on every one of the yard's three dividers and one every where the west divider meets the sides. The chamber incorporates an equivalent number of round limestone sections each remaining inverse one of the docks, separated. 

The rectangular narthex establishes the center piece of the structure, between the chamber and the cella, and fills in as the hall of the congregation. It lies legitimately east of the chamber, through a wide entryway flanked by a few high roundabout turrets. Mavrodinov compares the narthex of the Round Church to comparative structures in the houses of worship of Mount Athos, in light of its profundity. 

Together with the north and south divider, the passageway of the narthex successfully separates two littler pieces of the chamber, comparative in plan and open through entryways. The north part incorporates a little necropolis, while the south part was most likely a baptistery, as it includes a square establishment with a mud pipe that looks like a baptismal textual style. Be that as it may, Nikolova considers its shape excessively bizarre and its profundity unsatisfactory for submersion, and trusts it might rather have been structured as a vessel for apportioning heavenly water. 

Estimating , the narthex is the piece of the Round Church which has made due fit as a fiddle, as a portion of its dividers reach . Its two turrets have a width of ; every ha a passage confronting the inside of the narthex and three windows. The higher scopes of the towers were come to through winding stairways, archeological survives from which have been uncovered in the north turret. There are two sets of segments inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is available from the north pinnacle. The sections partition the narthex into three naves and imprint the route from the narthex access to the entryways of the rotunda. 

The round cella is the easternmost and most essential piece of the congregation, as it was the place the ritual was performed. The width of the rotunda is . It is gotten to through three entryways, all from the narthex. It was totally secured by a vault. Twelve vaults, half circle as observed from within and pentagonal on the external divider, were developed north and south of the rotunda's eastern part, the apse, which itself fits into one of the vaults. Huge supports fortify the structure both inside and outside. A hover of ten or twelve white marble segments was engraved inside the rotunda, from the inside braces. The capitals of the segments are like those of the regal royal residence in Preslav. A copper-plated wooden box lay in an internment chamber by one of the vaults close to the apse. 

The crescent apse fits normally with different vaults of the rotunda notwithstanding being bigger, and highlights vaults on its north and south dividers. The marble ambon was arranged in the focal point of the hover of sections and of the entire rotunda, legitimately under the arch's inside, as confirm by a mortar cushioning. Stairs from the east and west, lined up with the apse, used to pave the way to the ambon. The cleric's position of authority or cathedra presumably lay almost one of the south vaults, which was likely expanded for the reason. 

The inside was richly finished with vivid Byzantine-style mosaics, cornices, and pottery. Except for the Corinthian and Doric section capitals, which are of Roman or Byzantine starting point, the remainder of the improvement was made explicitly for and amid the congregation's development. Vlasto finds a Proto-Bulgarian flavor in the congregation's inside and an association with the specialty of Persia or Central Asia. Along these lines, he trusts that it did not depend on Byzantine instances of that age. Of an opposite feeling is Miyatev, who brings up critical likenesses between the beautification of the Round Church and that of the Church of the Mother of God (presently part of the Fenari Isa Mosque) from 908 in Constantinople. Mavrodinov goes above and beyond to guarantee that the engineer of the Round Church was straightforwardly motivated by antiquated models, refering to specifically the rich sculptural design. 

The Round Church was unmatched in its fired embellishment by any congregation in Preslav, and was the main known structure in the city to depend vigorously on polychrome fired tiles. Clay and mosaic symbols were a feature of the inside; they ran in size from nearly life-sized to smaller than usual. While the artistic pictures were built out of mud tiles, the mosaic symbols were increasingly changed in their material, which included earth, glass, and stone of different shades on a gold-hued foundation. Among the depicted holy people and scriptural figures are Charalampus and maybe Joel. A portion of the pictures were encased in circles. 

The Round Church included marble and limestone cornices. These incorporated countless decorations and subtleties, for example, palmettes, grape groups, leaves, and chamfers. Other than great decorative shapes, the cornices highlight some that are totally new in character or surely understood yet overhauled themes. Botanical enrichment commands the cornices. Tiles found inside the congregation ruins portray winged creatures and different creatures notwithstanding geometric shapes and flower themes, all coated in either dark colored, yellow, green, blue, or blue-green. The dividers were shrouded in cleaned marble looking with encrusted shapes. 

The Round Church contains numerous medieval engravings, both authority and scratched on its dividers as spray painting. One examination tallied a sum of 30Â drawings, most by far bearing some sort of Christian imagery. All in all, the epigraphy of the Round Church dates from the tenth century, and three letters in order are spoken to: the Greek, the Glagolitic, and the Cyrillic, just as two dialects: Byzantine Greek and Old Bulgarian (the eastern Bulgarian recension of Old Church Slavonic). The Glagolitic engravings of the Round Church bear proof that the utilization of that letters in order in Preslav proceeded close by Cyrillic. 

Maybe the most well known and profitable composition on the dividers of the congregation is a Cyrillic engraving on the south mass of the premises south of the narthex, ordinarily known as the baptistery. The engraving was awkwardly composed over a mortar putty and says in interpretation: "Church of Saint John, worked by chartophylax Paul". Regardless of being dated to the tenth century and its notice of the congregation's commitment and its potential contributor, it can't be depicted a great benefactor's engraving a direct result of its unnatural area and cumbersome composition. Nikolova thinks of it as almost certain that the writer of the engraving was a proficient individual who served under chartophylax Paul and wanted to spread his acclaim. She trusts the content may allude to the development of the narthex just instead of the entire church, since she is of the feeling that the narthex may have been included after the structure of the rotunda. 

Different instances of the epigraphy of the Round Church incorporate a few short Glagolitic and Cyrillic messages and separate letters. Among the Glagolitic engravings is the Preslav Abecedarium, a ritualistic content including the initial thirteen letters of that letter set; a portion of the Cyrillic writings were composed on artistic tiles. The names and portrayals connected to the symbols are in Greek, while there are additionally bilingual engravings in Greek and Bulgarian. Singular letters engraved on the dividers show the way Greek and improved Glagolitic letterforms were joined to frame the early Cyrillic letters in order. On the dividers of the congregation are spray painting of Christian crosses, creatures, and up to 11 delineations of boats. No less than one tribute has been found, recorded on the headstone of a lady portrayed as "God's hireling Tudora".
