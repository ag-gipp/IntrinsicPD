In 1914, William Fox was working the fruitful film wholesaler Box Office Attraction Film Rental Company. Film industry acquired movies from studios, for example, Balboa Amusement Producing Company, appearing in Fox's New York zone theaters and leasing prints to exhibitors somewhere else in the nation. "Life's Shop Window" may have initially been considered for creation thusly. In any case, Fox chose he was reluctant to rely upon others for the items his business required, and rather arranged to create his own movies under the Box Office Attractions Company name. He obtained the Ãclair film studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey and property in Staten Island, organized on-screen characters and team, and started generation with an adjustment of a set up work, as was normal at the time. 

Rights to the film adjustment were bought for $100.

Fox chosen J. Gordon Edwards to coordinate, in what may have been his directorial debut; credit for the prior "St. Elmo" is debated, with sources differing whether Edwards or Bertram Bracken coordinated.
