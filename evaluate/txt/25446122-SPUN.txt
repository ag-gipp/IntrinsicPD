Skirmish of Winterthur 

The Battle of Winterthur (27 May 1799) was a critical activity between components of the Army of the Danube and components of the Habsburg armed force, told by Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze, amid the War of the Second Coalition, some portion of the French Revolutionary Wars. The community of Winterthur lies upper east of ZÃ¼rich, in Switzerland. On account of its situation at the intersection of seven streets, the military that held the town controlled access to a large portion of Switzerland and focuses crossing the Rhine into southern Germany. In spite of the fact that the powers included were little, the capacity of the Austrians to support their 11-hour attack on the French line brought about the solidification of three Austrian powers on the level north of ZÃ¼rich, prompting the French annihilation a couple of days after the fact. 

By mid-May 1799, the Austrians had wrested control of parts of Switzerland from the French as powers under the order of Hotze and Count Heinrich von Bellegarde drove them out of the Grisons. In the wake of vanquishing Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's 25,000-man Army of the Danube at the skirmishes of Ostrach and Stockach, the principle Austrian armed force, under direction of Archduke Charles, crossed the Rhine at the Swiss town of Schaffhausen and arranged to join with the armed forces of Hotze and Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, on the fields encompassing ZÃ¼rich. 

The French Army of Helvetia and the Army of the Danube, presently both under the direction of AndrÃ© MassÃ©na, tried to keep this merger. MassÃ©na sent Michel Ney and a little blended rangers and infantry constrain from ZÃ¼rich to stop Hotze's power at Winterthur. Notwithstanding a sharp challenge, the Austrians prevailing with regards to driving the French out of the Winterthur good countries, albeit the two sides took high setbacks. When the association of the Habsburg armed forces occurred toward the beginning of June, Archduke Charles assaulted French positions at ZÃ¼rich and constrained the French to pull back past the Limmat. 

At first, the leaders of Europe saw the transformation in France as a contention between the French lord and his subjects, and not something in which they ought to meddle. As progressive talk developed increasingly strident, they pronounced the enthusiasm of the rulers of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family; this Declaration of Pillnitz compromised equivocal, however very genuine, outcomes on the off chance that anything ought to happen to the regal family. The French position turned out to be progressively troublesome. Intensifying issues in worldwide relations, French Ã©migrÃ©s kept on upsetting for a counter-unrest. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention proclaimed war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792â 1798), France ran itself against the greater part of the European states sharing area or water outskirts with her, in addition to Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. In spite of the fact that the Coalition powers accomplished a few triumphs at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and WÃ¼rzburg, the endeavors of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy driven Austrian powers back and brought about the arrangement of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the ensuing Treaty of Campo Formio (17 October 1797). 

The bargain assembled for conferences between the included gatherings to work out the accurate regional and gainful subtleties. Met at a community in the mid-Rhineland, Rastatt, the Congress immediately wrecked in a soil of interest and political acting. The French requested a more area. The Austrians were hesitant to surrender the assigned domains. Intensifying the Congress' issues, strains developed among France and the greater part of the First Coalition partners. Ferdinand of Naples would not pay settled upon tribute to France, and his subjects pursued this refusal with a resistance. The French attacked Naples and built up the Parthenopean Republic. Energized by the French Republic, a republican uprising in the Swiss cantons prompted the topple of the Swiss Confederation and the foundation of the Helvetic Republic. The French Directory was persuaded that the Austrians were intending to begin another war. Surely, the flimsier France appeared, the more genuinely the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the British talked about this plausibility. In mid-spring, the Austrians achieved a concurrence with Tsar Paul of Russia by which Alexander Suvorov would leave retirement to help Austria in Italy with another 60,000 troops. 

The French Directory's military methodology in 1799Â called for hostile crusades on all fronts: focal Italy, northern Italy, the Swiss cantons, the upper Rhineland, and The Netherlands. Hypothetically, the French had a consolidated power of 250,000Â troops, yet this was on paper, not in the field. As winter broke in 1799, General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and the Army of the Danube, at a paper quality of 50,000Â and a real quality of 25,000, crossed the Rhine among Basel and Kehl on 1 March. This intersection formally damaged the Treaty of Campo Formio. The Army of the Danube progressed through the Black Forest and, by mid-March, set up a hostile position at the western and northern edge of the Swiss Plateau by the town of Ostrach. AndrÃ© MassÃ©na had just pushed into Switzerland with his power of 30,000, and effectively go into the Grison Alps, Chur, and FinstermÃ¼nz on the Inn. Hypothetically, his left flank was to interface with Jourdan's correct flank, instructed by Pierre Marie BarthÃ©lemy Ferino, at the far eastern shore of Lake Constance. 

The Austrians had displayed their very own military in a line from the Tyrol to the Danube. A power of 46,000Â under order of Count Heinrich von Bellegarde shaped the guard of the Tyrol. Another little Austrian power of 26,000Â commanded by Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze protected the Vorarlberg. The fundamental Austrian Armyânear 80,000 troops under the direction of Archduke Charlesâhad wintered in the Bavarian, Austrian, and Salzburg domains on the eastern side of the Lech. At the clashes of Ostrach (21 March) and Stockach (25 March), the primary Austrian power drove the Army of the Danube once again into the Black Forest. Charles made arrangements to cross the upper Rhine at the Swiss town of Schaffhausen. Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze brought a bit (around 8,000) of his power west, leaving the rest to protect the Vorarlberg. In the meantime, Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, brought the left wing of the fundamental Austrian power over the Rhine by Eglisau. They intended to join with the primary Austrian armed force, controlling the northern passages of ZÃ¼rich and driving a commitment with MassÃ©na. 

By mid-May, French confidence was low. They had endured horrible misfortunes at Ostrach and Stockach, in spite of the fact that these had been made up by fortifications. Two senior officers of the Army of the Danube, Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen and Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul, were confronting courts-military on charges of unfortunate behavior, maintained by their senior officer, Jourdan. Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte and Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr were wiped out, or guaranteed they were, and had left the military's places to stay to recoup their wellbeing. MassÃ©na's power had been repulsed by Hotze's military at Feldkirch, and compelled to fall back, and LeCourbe's inability to push through against Bellegarde's Austrian power in the Tyrol implied MassÃ©na needed to pull his southern wing back just as his middle and northern wing, to keep up correspondence with the withdrawing armed forces on his flanks. Now, likewise, the Swiss revolted once more, this time against the French, and ZÃ¼rich turned into the last solid position MassÃ©na could take. 

Winterthur (; ) lies in a bowl south and east of the TÃ¶ss roughly upper east of ZÃ¼rich. Toward the north and east of the town lies a ring of slopes around high. Toward the west, the TÃ¶ss keeps running on its course north toward the Rhine. The region of a Roman settlement from 200Â to 400, and the site of a medieval fight in 919, its area at seven intersection gave it vital significance in the push to control northâ south and eastâ west correspondence in the beginning of the War of the Second Coalition. 

After the annihilations at the fights at Ostrach and Stockach, and the Army of the Danube's retreat into the Black Forest, the French Directory had sacked Jean-Baptiste Jourdan in April 1799 and given order of both the Army of Helvetia and the Army of the Danube to AndrÃ© MassÃ©na. Ensuring the northern access to ZÃ¼rich, MassÃ©na assembled probably the best leaders he had accessible; inevitably, three of them would move toward becoming Marshals of France, and Tharreau, a trustworthy General of Division. 

The circumstance for the French was critical. Not just had they been trounced in southwestern Germany, the incredible Alexander Suvorov was en route to northern Italy with 60,000 Russians to assume responsibility for Coalition powers there. Tally Heinrich Bellegarde, situated with 20,000 men in the Grisons, successfully secluded MassÃ©na's power from any help out of Italy. Most compromising, Archduke Charles' fundamental armed force lay not exactly multi day away; in size alone, it could overpower him, or, in the event that he pulled back toward the west, its position remove his road of withdrawal toward France. On the off chance that Charles' left wing, directed by Nauendorf, joined with Hotze's power, drawing nearer from the east, MassÃ©na realized Charles would assault and in all respects likely drive him out of ZÃ¼rich. 

To keep this merger of the Austrian powers, MassÃ©na set up a forward line focused at Winterthur, and under in general direction of the accomplished Jean Victor Tharreau. The French powers were exhibited in an uneven half circle, in which Winterthur framed the focal part. The direction of the Winterthur detachments was the most vital. On the off chance that the inside couldn't hold its position, the flanks would be detached and smashed. MassÃ©na sent recently advanced General of Division Michel Ney to Winterthur on 27 May 1799 to assume responsibility for the inside. MassÃ©na reviewed him from his task instructing a station of Claude Lecourbe's power in focal Switzerland, and gave him an order additionally fitting with his new position. Ney touched base with the notoriety for strength considered run of the mill of mounted force officers, yet with insignificant involvement in ordering blended powers. Restless to substantiate himself yet mindful of conventions, he had rushed to Tharreau's home office, yet needed to hang tight for his "letters of administration" before he could take order. These touched base on 25 May. The troops at Winterthur incorporated a detachment of four regiments told by Dominique Mansuy Roget, a powerless unit instructed by ThÃ©odore Maxime Gazan, and a mounted force detachment directed by FrÃ©dÃ©ric Henri Walther. 

Like Ney, Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze, the Austrian administrator, was additionally a rangers officer. In contrast to Ney, he had wide field involvement. The Swiss-conceived Hotze had entered the military administration of the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg in 1758 and had been elevated to "Rittmeister", or chief of mounted force; he had battled quickly in the Seven Years' War, however observed no battle. Afterward, he served in the Russian armed force in the Russo-Turkish War (1768â 74). With an Austrian commission, he joined the Habsburg magnificent armed force, and served in the short War of the Bavarian Succession (1778â 79). His crusading in the War of the First Coalition, especially at the Battle of WÃ¼rzburg, had earned him the certainty of Archduke Charles and height to the positions of respectability by Charles' sibling, Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor. 

On 22 May 1799, Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, drove an expansive section over the Rhine at Konstanz, Stein and Eglisau. Hotze's power had officially crossed the Rhine further east, where it was as yet a mountain stream, and went through the Grisons, into Toggenburg, and pushed toward ZÃ¼rich. 

To keep these two powers from uniting with Archduke Charles' 100,000Â men, on 22 May, MassÃ©na and 23,000 troops of the Army of the Danube walked from ZÃ¼rich toward Winterthur. Once past Winterthur, they advanced another upper east and, on 25 May, the two armed forces conflicted at Frauenfeld. Out-numbered very nearly four to one, Hotze's power was gravely destroyed by the French; 750Â of Hotze's men were executed or injured, and 1,450Â captured; also, Hotze lost two firearms, and one shading. His second-in-direction, Major General Christoph Karl von Piacsek, was injured in real life and kicked the bucket later of his injuries. Regardless of the prevalence of the French numbers, however, Hotze removed his power from the commitment, moved around the French position, and got away toward Winterthur. 

In the interim, by 26 May Nauendorf set up camp close Andelfingen and reacquired contact with the principle Austrian power. Having joined with Nauendorf, Archduke Charles anticipated Hotze's power, originating from the east, before he would assault the French at ZÃ¼rich. That equivalent night, Hotze stayed outdoors among Frauenfeld and HÃ¼ttwilen, about southeast of Nauendorf's position, and sent his development posts as a long ways ahead as Islikon and Elgg, just east of Winterthur. 

On the morning of 27 May, Hotze amassed his power into three sections and walked toward Winterthur. Inverse him, Michel Ney, recently in direction of his division of roughly 3,000 men, conveyed his power around the statures, the supposed Ober-Winterthur, a ring of low-lying slopes some north of the city. 

Given the extent of the Austrian power moving toward him, Ney intended to pull back to Winterthur. Before he could actualize this activity, the general officer of the forward line, Jean Victor Tharreau, had dashed to his position and said he would bolster Ney by sending Jean-de-Dieu Soult's division; Ney comprehended this to mean he was to persevere along the whole station line, and that he would not be disconnected. His little power would get fortifications from Soult's division. Thus, Ney coordinated the weakest detachment, under the order of Gazan, to climb a long valley toward Frauenfeld, and another unit, under the direction of Roget, to take the right, keeping any Austrian flanking move. 

By early in the day, Hotze's propelled watchman had experienced moderate French obstruction first from Roget's unit, and afterward, very quickly, from Gazan's. The Austrian development troops rapidly overran Gazan's feeble unit and claimed the forested areas encompassing the town of Islikon. In the wake of verifying the towns of Gundeschwil, Schottikon, Wiesendangen, and Stogen, further west of Islikon, Hotze sent two of his segments confronting the French front, while a third calculated to the French ideal, as Ney had expected he would. 

By early in the day, Ney had pushed toward the front with Gazan's detachment and he could see the adversary progressing toward; regardless him anticipating Soult's fortifications on his flanks, he foreseen a simple triumph, similar to the one three days sooner in which MassÃ©na's power had beat Hotze's segment at Frauenfeld. He didn't understand, in any event not yet, that Hotze had 8,000Â men with which to verify the intersection north of Winterthur. Ney conveyed a greater amount of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his pony went down; the steed was slaughtered and Ney got knee damage. He had his injury swathed, required another pony, and returned the battle. 

Ney presently had two issues: he expected help segments from Soult's division on the two flanks to arrive immediately and he didn't realize that the Austrians had landed in power, straightforwardly before his inside. Despite the fact that Roget's detachment was sufficiently able to keep the Austrians from flanking the position, Gazan's unit was too frail to even think about resisting the predominant Austrian power, which was becoming noticeably more grounded as Hotze's troops kept on touching base at the forward line and devote themselves completely to the conflict. 

At long last tolerating that Soult would not arrive, Ney couldn't plan to hold his position, substantially less drive the Austrians back. He inferred that he should fall back to Winterthur. To cover the retreat, he educated Walther and his rangers to set up a situation on the TÃ¶ss, over the scaffold at Stieg. From that point, the mounted force could secure a systematic retreat. In the midst of a sloppy current nourishing the TÃ¶ss, Ney situated a second separation guarding the town of TÃ¶ss and the street prompting an edge of the slopes, where he put a few guns. From the edge, his back gatekeeper could fire its mounted guns on the Austrian development. 

For Walther, at the extension, the position seemed faultless for whatever length of time that it would take to expel Ney's power through Winterthur, yet the stun of the Austrian power, as it hit his protections, was adequate to break his line following an hour and a half of lively battling. Be that as it may, there the Austrian forward energy slowed down. Despite the fact that Hotze's men constrained Walther's from the extension, they themselves couldn't cross it. From the edge, Ney's back gatekeeper kept up a constant flow of gun shoot on any of the Austrians who crossed the extension and endeavored to progress up the slope. Hotze perceived the pointlessness of tossing his men into direct gun shoot and requested rather a consistent musketry blast. This demonstrated viable, for Ney was again harmed, this time in his left hand, and his second steed was killed; he surrendered order to Gazan, who sorted out the proceeded with withdrawal from the position. 

At the point when the Archduke knew about Hotze's accomplishment in taking Winterthur intersection, he guided his troops to expand Nauendorf's, and to take the town and the environs of Neftenbach, west-northwest of Winterthur. Nicolas Oudinot, whose men had verified Neftenbach as a feature of the French forward line, waited for the greater part of the day, yet was compelled to withdraw to Pfungen in the late evening; his situation there was not faultless and he was driven further back to the edges of ZÃ¼rich. By taking Neftenbach, Charles set an impressive gathering of troops between Ney's power and Hotze's flank and constrained an uneven French withdrawal toward ZÃ¼rich. Tharreau moved around the TÃ¶ss, endeavoring to restore his forward line, however MassÃ©na did not need a general commitment among ZÃ¼rich and Neftenbach, not there and not at that point. The Armies of Switzerland and the Danube were not prepared to take on Charles; MassÃ©na's powers were not set up for a fight on the scale required in confronting Charles' whole armed force, and he required the barriers offered by ZÃ¼rich to mount a legitimate line against the approaching Austrian assault. Inevitably, Tharreau pulled back the whole forward line to ZÃ¼rich. The conflict took 11 hours. 

Hotze's power took generally high setbacksâ1,000Â men murdered, injured or missing (12.5 percent) of his whole power of 8,000âin spite of the fact that his misfortunes were tantamount to Ney's 800 executed injured or missing, from his 7,000-man drive (11.5 percent). All the more imperatively, however, Hotze succeeded not just in driving the French once again from Winterthur, yet in addition in joining his power with Nauendorf and Charles'. The brought together Austrian power finished the half circle around MassÃ©na's situations at ZÃ¼rich. 

For the French, in spite of their prosperity prior at Frauenfeld, the activity was extensively less effective. In the conflict, Ney was adequately injured that he took quick leave, and stayed out of activity and order until 22 July. The direct of the fight additionally exhibited the shortcoming of the French order framework in which individual ill will and rivalry between high-positioning officers, for this situation, Soult and Tharreau, undermined French military targets. Tharreau inevitably accused Soult of resistance; Soult had through and through wouldn't go to Ney's help, in spite of explicit, and direct, requests to move his division to Ney's flanks. 

Moreover, the French hazardously thought little of Austrian diligence and military aptitude. The "white coats", as the French called the Austrians, were obviously better fighters than the French expected, and in spite of such exhibitions as that at Ostrach, Stockach and Winterthur, the French kept on holding this partiality. This did not change until 1809 when the Battle of Aspern-Essling and the Battle of Wagram half a month later made Napoleon reconsider his conclusion of the Austrian military. 

At long last, the fight at Winterthur made conceivable the triumph at ZÃ¼rich. When the Austrian armed forces joined west, north and east of ZÃ¼rich, Charles chose he had an adequately better power than assault MassÃ©na's situations in ZÃ¼rich. His system, to build up a combining assault, was not by any stretch of the imagination conceivable without another Austria corps, which was told by Suvorov, and situated in the mountains in Italy; this would have made conceivable the close circle of MassÃ©na's direction at ZÃ¼rich, making the French position illogical. All things considered, at the First Battle of ZÃ¼rich (4â 7 June 1799), the Austrian armed force constrained the French to relinquish ZÃ¼rich; MassÃ©na pulled back over the Limmat, where he set up a cautious position on the low-lying slopes sitting above the city and anticipated his chance to reacquire the city.
