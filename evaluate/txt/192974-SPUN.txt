ÃedÃ¡n macintosh GabrÃ¡in 

ÃedÃ¡n macintosh GabrÃ¡in (articulated in Old Irish) was a ruler of DÃ¡l Riata from c. 574 until c. 609. The kingdom of DÃ¡l Riata was arranged in present day Argyll and Bute, Scotland, and parts of County Antrim, Ireland. Parentages record that ÃedÃ¡n was a child of GabrÃ¡n macintosh Domangairt. 

He was a contemporary of Saint Columba, and much that is recorded of his life and profession originates from hagiography, for example, AdomnÃ¡n of Iona's "Life of Saint Columba". ÃedÃ¡n shows up as a character in Old Irish and Middle Irish language works of composition and stanza, some currently lost. 

The Irish archives record ÃedÃ¡n's battles against his neighbors, in Ireland, and in northern Britain, including endeavors to the Orkney Islands, the Isle of Man, and the east shoreline of Scotland. As recorded by Bede, ÃedÃ¡n was definitively vanquished by Ãthelfrith of Bernicia at the Battle of Degsastan. ÃedÃ¡n may have been ousted, or have surrendered, following this thrashing. His date of death is recorded by one source as 17 April 609. 

The hotspots for ÃedÃ¡n's life incorporate Bede's "Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum"; Irish records, primarily the "Archives of Ulster" and the "Chronicles of Tigernach"; and AdomnÃ¡n's "Life of Saint Columba". The "Senchus fer n-Alban", a registration and family history of DÃ¡l Riata, implies to record his heritage and that of his prompt relatives. None of these sources are contemporary. AdomnÃ¡n's work was written in the exceptionally late seventh century, most likely to check the centennial of Columba's passing. It consolidates components from a lost before life of Columba, "De virtutibus sancti Columbae", by CummÃ©ne Find. This may have been composed as right on time as 640; neither the components consolidated from CummÃ©ne's work nor AdomnÃ¡n's very own compositions can be treated as straightforward history. Bede's history was composed 30 years after AdomnÃ¡n's. The enduring Irish archives contain components of an account kept at Iona from the center of the seventh century onwards, so these too are review when managing ÃedÃ¡n's time. 

The Rawlinson B 502 composition, dated to c. 1130, contains the story "Gein Branduib maic Echach ocus AedÃ¡in maic GabrÃ¡in" ("The Birth of Brandub child of Eochu and of AedÃ¡n child of GabrÃ¡n"). In this story, ÃedÃ¡n is the twin sibling of Brandub macintosh Echach, a King of Leinster who had a place with the UÃ­ Cheinnselaig related. ÃedÃ¡n is traded during childbirth for one of the twin girls of GabrÃ¡n, brought into the world that night, with the goal that every family may have a child. "The Prophecy of BerchÃ¡n" additionally relates ÃedÃ¡n with Leinster. John Bannerman inferred that "[t]here is by all accounts no premise of reality behind these conventions." Francis John Byrne recommended that the "Echtra" was composed by an artist at the court of Diarmait macintosh MaÃ­l na mBÃ³, an eleventh century relative of Brandub, and was composed to concrete a union among Diarmait and the Scots lord MÃ¡el Coluim macintosh Donnchada ("Malcolm III"), who professed to be a relative of ÃedÃ¡n. A lost Irish story, "Echtra ÃedÃ¡in macintosh GabrÃ¡in" ("The Adventures of ÃedÃ¡n child of GabrÃ¡n"), shows up in a rundown of works, however its substance are obscure. ÃedÃ¡n is a character in the epic "ScÃ©la Cano meic GartnÃ¡in", yet the occasions which roused the story seem to have occurred amidst the seventh century. He additionally shows up in the story "Compert MongÃ¡in". 

ÃedÃ¡n furthermore shows up in an assortment of Welsh sources, making him one of only a handful few non-Britons to figure in Welsh custom. Welsh sources call him "Aedan Bradawc", signifying "The Treacherous" or "The Wily". He may have earned this sobriquet after the breakdown of a collusion with Rhydderch Hael, ruler of the close-by Brittonic kingdom of Alt Clut; hatred between them is recalled in the Welsh Triads and somewhere else. Another Triad records ÃedÃ¡n's host as one of the "Three Faithful War-Bands of the Island of Britain", as they "went to the ocean for their ruler". This may point to a generally lost convention concerning one of ÃedÃ¡n's ocean undertakings, for example, to Orkney or the Isle of Man. Also, a few Welsh works guarantee a Brittonic family for ÃedÃ¡n. The "Bonedd GwÅ·r y Gogledd" records him as a descendent of Dyfnwal Hen of Alt Clut, however the lineage is highly befuddled ("Gauran" is given as his child, as opposed to father). The Cambro-Latin "De Situ Brecheniauc" and "Cognacio Brychan" guarantee his mom was Luan, little girl of Brychan of Brycheiniog in Wales. In spite of the fact that these families are conflicting and likely questionable, they are outstanding in featuring ÃedÃ¡n's nearby relationship with the Britons. 

ÃedÃ¡n was the head lord in DÃ¡l Riata, managing over lesser innate rulers. The "Senchus fer n-Alban" records the sub-divisions of DÃ¡l Riata in the seventh and eighth hundreds of years, yet no record from ÃedÃ¡n's time endures. As per the "Senchus", DÃ¡l Riata was separated into three sub-kingdoms in the seventh century, each ruled by a family aggregate named for their eponymous author. These were the CenÃ©l nGabrÃ¡in, named for ÃedÃ¡n's dad, who led over Kintyre, Cowal and Bute; the CenÃ©l Loairn of northern Argyll; and the CenÃ©l nÃ³engusa of Islay. Inside these there were littler divisions or clans which are named by the "Senchus". Subtleties of the Irish piece of the kingdom are less clear. 

Searching externally, DÃ¡l Riata's neighbors in north Britain were the Picts and the Britons of the "Hen Ogledd", the Brittonic-talking portions of what is currently Northern England and southern Lowland Scotland. The most dominant Brittonic kingdom in the zone was Alt Clut, later known as Strathclyde and Cumbria. Late in ÃedÃ¡n's life, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Bernicia turned into the best power in north Britain. 

In Ireland, DÃ¡l Riata shaped piece of Ulster, controlled by BÃ¡etÃ¡n macintosh Cairill of the DÃ¡l Fiatach. The other real gathering in Ulster were the separated clans of the Cruithne, later known as the DÃ¡l nAraidi. The most essential Cruithne lord in ÃedÃ¡n's time was Fiachnae macintosh BÃ¡etÃ¡in. Past the kingdom of Ulster, and by and large unfriendly to it, were the different kingdoms and clans of the UÃ­ NÃ©ill and their subjects and partners. Of the UÃ­ NÃ©ill lords, Ãed macintosh Ainmuirech of the CenÃ©l Conaill, Columba's first cousin once evacuated, was the most vital amid ÃedÃ¡n's rule. 

AdomnÃ¡n, the "Senchus fer n-Alban" and the Irish archives record ÃedÃ¡n as a child of GabrÃ¡n macintosh Domangairt (kicked the bucket c. 555â 560). ÃedÃ¡n's sibling EoganÃ¡n is known from AdomnÃ¡n and his demise is recorded c. 597. The "Senchus" names three different children of GabrÃ¡n, to be specific Cuildach, Domnall, and Domangart. Albeit nothing is known about Cuildach and Domangart or their relatives, AdomnÃ¡n makes reference to a certain Ioan, child of Conall, child of Domnall, "who had a place with the illustrious ancestry of the CenÃ©l nGabrÃ¡in", yet this is by and large perused as implying that Ioan was a brother of the CenÃ©l nGabrÃ¡in, and his granddad named Domnall isn't believed to be a similar individual as ÃedÃ¡n's sibling Domnall. 

ÃedÃ¡n was around forty years of age when he progressed toward becoming ruler, following the passing of his uncle Conall macintosh Comgaill in 574. His progression as lord may have been challenged; AdomnÃ¡n states that Columba had favored the appointment of ÃedÃ¡n's sibling EoganÃ¡n. AdomnÃ¡n claims that ÃedÃ¡n was appointed as ruler by Columba, the primary case of an appointment known in Britain and Ireland. 

In 574, after the record of Conall's demise, the "Chronicles of Ulster" and the "Archives of Tigernach" record a fight in Kintyre, called the Battle of Teloch, or Delgu. The exact area of the fight is unidentified. The records concur that "DÃºnchad, child of Conall, child of Comgall, and numerous others of the partners of the children of GabrÃ¡n, fell." In 575, the "Chronicles of Ulster" report "the extraordinary tradition of Druim Cett", at Mullagh or Daisy Hill close Limavady, with Ãed macintosh Ainmuirech and Columba in participation. AdomnÃ¡n reports that ÃedÃ¡n was available at the gathering. The reason for the gathering isn't altogether sure, however one understanding made there concerned the status of ÃedÃ¡n's kingdom. ÃedÃ¡n and Ãed concurred that while the armada of DÃ¡l Riata would serve the UÃ­ NÃ©ill, no tribute would be paid to them, and warriors would just be given from the DÃ¡l Riata arrives in Ireland. 

The explanation behind this understanding is thought to have been the risk presented to ÃedÃ¡n, and furthermore to Ãed, by BÃ¡etÃ¡n macintosh Cairill. BÃ¡etÃ¡n is said to have constrained the ruler of DÃ¡l Riata to pay reverence to him at Rosnaree on Islandmagee. ÃedÃ¡n is believed to be the ruler being referred to, and Ulster sources state that BÃ¡etÃ¡n gathered tribute from Scotland. Following BÃ¡etÃ¡n's passing in 581, the Ulstermen relinquished the Isle of Man, which they had caught in BÃ¡etÃ¡n's time, maybe determined out by ÃedÃ¡n who is recorded as battling there c. 583. Prior, c. 580, ÃedÃ¡n is said to have struck Orkney, which had been liable to Bridei child of Maelchon, King of the Picts, at a prior date. 

ÃedÃ¡n's crusades on the Isle of Man have at times been mistaken for the fight against the Miathi referenced by AdomnÃ¡n. The Miathi seem to have been the Maeatae, a clan in the zone of the upper stream Forth. This crusade was fruitful, however ÃedÃ¡n's children ArtÃºr and Eochaid Find were slaughtered fighting as indicated by AdomnÃ¡n. This fight may have occurred c. 590 and been recorded as the Battle of Leithreid or Leithrig. 

The "Prediction of BerchÃ¡n" says of ÃedÃ¡n: "Thirteen years (in a steady progression) [he will battle against] the Pictish have (reasonable the diadem)." The main recorded fight among ÃedÃ¡n and the Picts seems to have been battled in Circinn, in 599 or after, where ÃedÃ¡n was vanquished. The chronicles notice the passings of his children here. It has been recommended that this fight was mistaken for the "Skirmish of Asreth" in Circinn, battled c. 584, in which Bridei child of Maelchon was executed. This fight is portrayed as being "battled between the Picts themselves". 

Various Welsh customs point to fighting among ÃedÃ¡n and King Rhydderch Hael of Alt Clut, the northern Brittonic kingdom later known as Strathclyde. Hector Munro Chadwick and resulting students of history propose ÃedÃ¡n was at first in a long haul collusion with Rhydderch and his forerunners, however that it in the end crumbled into struggle. AdomnÃ¡n reports that Rhydderch sent a priest named Luigbe to Iona to talk with Columba "for he needed to realize whether he would be butchered by his adversaries or not". A Welsh Triad names ÃedÃ¡n's pillaging of Alt Clut as one of the "three over the top plunderings of Britain", and the ballad "Peiryan Vaban" recounts a fight among ÃedÃ¡n and Rhydderch. The lost Irish epic "Orgain Sratha Cluada" is generally thought to allude to the assault on Alt Clut in 870 by Vikings, however MacQuarrie recommends that it might allude to an assault by ÃedÃ¡n on Rhydderch. 

Degsastan shows up not to have been the primary fight among ÃedÃ¡n and the Bernicians. The passing of his child Domangart in the place where there is the Saxons is referenced by AdomnÃ¡n, and it is assumed that Bran kicked the bucket in the equivalent generally unrecorded fight. 

Of the foundations of this contention, Bede makes reference to just that ÃedÃ¡n was frightened by Ãthelfrith's development. Wherever the Battle of Degsastan was battled, Bede considered it to be existing in Northumbria. The fight was a definitive triumph for Ãthelfrith, and Bede says, cautiously, that "[f]rom that day until the present, no lord of the Irish in Britain has set out to do fight with the English." Although successful, Ãthelfrith endured misfortunes; Bede reveals to us his sibling Theodbald was killed with all his following. Theodbald seems, by all accounts, to be called Eanfrith in Irish sources, which name his executioner as MÃ¡el Umai macintosh BÃ¡etÃ¡in of the CenÃ©l nEÃ³gain, child of High-King BÃ¡etÃ¡n macintosh Ninnedo. The Irish ballad "Compert MongÃ¡in" says that the lord of Ulster, Fiachnae macintosh BÃ¡etÃ¡in of the DÃ¡l nAraidi, supported ÃedÃ¡n against the Saxons, maybe at Degsastan. The "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle" makes reference to that Hering, child of King Hussa of Bernicia, was available, clearly battling with ÃedÃ¡n. 

After the thrashing of Degsastan, the chronicles report nothing of ÃedÃ¡n until his demise around six years after the fact, maybe on 17 April 609, the date provided by the "Martyrology of Tallaght", made c. 800. The "Records of Tigernach" give his age as 74. The "Prediction of BerchÃ¡n" places his demise in Kintyre and says "[h]e won't be ruler at the season of his passing", while the twelfth century "Acta Sancti Lasriani" claims that he was ousted from the authority. John of Fordun, writing in the fourteenth century, trusted that ÃedÃ¡n had been covered at Kilkerran in Kintyre. 

ÃedÃ¡n was prevailing by his child, Eochaid Buide. AdomnÃ¡n gives a record of Columba's prescience that Eochaid's more established siblings would predecease their dad. ÃedÃ¡n's different children are named by the "Senchus fer n-Alban" as Eochaid Find, Tuathal, Bran, BaithÃ©ne, Conaing, and Gartnait. AdomnÃ¡n additionally names ArtÃºr, called a child of Conaing in the "Senchus", and Domangart, who is excluded in the "Senchus". Domangart too may have been a grandson as opposed to a child of ÃedÃ¡n, in all likelihood another child of Conaing. The principle line of CenÃ©l nGabrÃ¡in lords were the relatives of Eochaid Buide through his child Domnall Brecc, however the relatives of Conaing effectively challenged for the position of authority all through the seventh century and into the eighth. 

It has been proposed that Gartnait child of ÃedÃ¡n could be a similar individual as Gartnait child of Domelch, ruler of the Picts, whose passing is accounted for around 601, however this lays on the possibility of Pictish matriliny, which has been censured. Indeed, even less positively, it has been contended that Gartnait's successor in the Pictish ruler records, Nechtan, was his grandson, and in this way ÃedÃ¡n's incredible grandson. 

Less is known about ÃedÃ¡n's girls. Maithgemm, likewise recorded as Gemma, wedded a sovereign named Cairell of the DÃ¡l Fiatach. The names of ÃedÃ¡n's spouses are not recorded, yet one was said to be Brittonic, and another may have been a Pictish lady named Domelch, if without a doubt the Gartnait child of Domelch and Gartnait child of ÃedÃ¡n are one and the equivalent.
