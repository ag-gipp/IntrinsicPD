Created as a thought for the following "Sonic" amusement, the model included Sonic and Tails combined by a flexible band of vitality. Improvement in the long run moved to the more dominant 32X extra for the Genesis. Sonic and Tails were supplanted by a gathering of characters driven by Knuckles the Echidna, yet the center tying ongoing interaction was held. The task was titled "Knuckles' Ringstar", and later "Knuckles' Chaotix". The "Sonic Crackers" model ROM picture was later released on the web and can be played with emulators. 

Alongside Knuckles being given a featuring job, the amusement incorporates Mighty the Armadillo, who had recently showed up in the arcade restrictive "SegaSonic the Hedgehog" (1993).

A spilled model adaptation of the diversion records Espio's name as the included character on the title screen rather than Knuckles, recommending he was once highlighted all the more conspicuously, perhaps in a featuring job.

"Knuckles' Chaotix" got blended audits, and bombed financially, as did the 32X. 

The amusement's introduction isolated faultfinders. The four analysts of "Electronic Gaming Monthly" ("EGM") commended its designs and trusted the amusement was a standout amongst the best for the 32X, and "GameFan" considered "Knuckles' Chaotix" the best passage in the establishment since "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" (1992). Then again, an analyst from "People to come" found the designs flashy, and felt that the diversion made "unremarkable endeavors to flaunt". "GamePro", "Amusement Players", and "IGN" trusted the diversion neglected to push the 32X as far as possible, refering to the absence of graphical impacts and Genesis-quality sound, however "IGN" felt a few components, for example, a few melodic tracks, were features. In 2008, "GamesRadar" composed that "Knuckles' Chaotix" was the best diversion for the 32X and was misjudged, however regardless it considered the amusement a "squandered chance". 

The "elastic band" multiplayer framework was generally panned, notwithstanding being recognized as a push to advance. However "IGN" respected the endeavor to "revive an arrangement that was coming up short on steam" and fix the unbalanced multiplayer of "Sonic 2" and "Sonic 3" (1994), whereby Tails would get lost off-screen, they felt the material science were "burdensome" and strange. "EGM" felt the framework was unique, yet backed off the ongoing interaction, as did "GamesRadar". "People to come" felt the bond was tiring and not really creative, and "GamePro" called it "Knuckles' Chaotix"s greatest blemish, thinking that its disappointing and uneven. The analyst likewise discovered that the bond muddled ongoing interaction and contrasted it with being cuffed. 

The dimension structure and low trouble were additionally scrutinized. "GamePro" composed that the dimensions, while genuinely extensive, were not populated with enough foes or mysteries, a slant resounded by "IGN" and "Mean Machines Sega". "IGN" considered the supervisor structure shortsighted and the dimension plan tasteless and apparently incomplete, and "Mean Machines Sega" believed that, without adversaries, "this is simply not a large portion of the amusement it could have been". "Amusement Players" condemned the diversion's absence of replay esteem, saying the amusement's effortlessness made privileged insights in levels difficult to miss. Be that as it may, "IGN", "GameFan", and "EGM" lauded the quantity of playable characters, and "IGN" felt the amusement's "sublime" completely 3D exceptional stages were the best of the "Sonic" arrangement. 

By and large, "IGN" depicted "Knuckles' Chaotix" as "a terrible diversion with a decent establishment", and in another article, inferred that the amusement was intriguing, whenever defective. "EGM" felt the amusement was the best for the 32X yet neglected to satisfy past recreations in the "Sonic" arrangement. "Amusement Players" found the diversion a noteworthy dissatisfaction, saying "other than a couple of shading improved foundations, you're going to ask why this isn't a Genesis title". A few columnists have alluded to "Knuckles' Chaotix" as the arrangement's declining point, and "AllGame" and "Complex" both composed that it was among the most noticeably awful recreations in the arrangement. 

"Knuckles' Chaotix" is viewed as the remainder of the "work of art" "Sonic" recreations before the 3D amusement "Sonic Adventure" (1998) took the arrangement in new ongoing interaction bearings. A few of its ideas were re-utilized in later "Sonic" diversions. A comparative accomplice framework includes in the Game Boy Advance diversion "Sonic Advance 3" (2004), and "IGN" noted similitudes between the amusement's auto-running extraordinary stages and "Sonic and the Secret Rings" (2007).

The "Hyper Ring" control up re-showed up in "Sonic Mania" (2017) and a diversion of "Knuckles' Chaotix"s last supervisor battle was included a 2018 update. 

Except for Mighty, who has made just appearances, all Chaotix individuals have turned out to be repeating characters in the "Sonic" arrangement. The gathering had storylines in the "Sonic the Hedgehog" comic arrangement delivered by Archie Comics and "Sonic the Comic" by Fleetway Publications, just as in the anime arrangement "Sonic X". "GamesRadar" considered the presentation of the Chaotix a defining moment for the arrangement, as it "weakened the "Sonic"- section by presenting huge amounts of crappy characters". 

In 2011, Sega noted fans as often as possible mentioned "Knuckles' Chaotix" as an amusement wanted to be rereleased. "1UP.com" and "GameSpy" communicated dissatisfaction the 2005 accumulation "Sonic Gems Collection" did exclude the amusement.
