"Bastion" is an activity pretending amusement with a dimension structure. The player character, "the Kid", travels through gliding, dream themed conditions that structure ways as the player approaches the edge. Levels comprise of a solitary plane, and are seen isometrically. They are loaded up with adversaries of different kinds, which endeavor to hurt the Kid. The Kid conveys two weapons, which might be chosen from the decisions accessible to the player at explicit areas called arms stockpiles. The Kid additionally can play out an exceptional assault. Weapons and extraordinary assaults must be gained before they can be utilized. There are a set number of exceptional assaults that the player can perform whenever, spoken to by "dark tonics" that can be found in the dimensions or dropped from foes. Extraordinary assaults might be utilized an aggregate of multiple times. This most extreme number of employments can be expanded in the Distillery. The Kid's wellbeing is spoken to by a wellbeing bar, which can be renewed with "wellbeing tonics". Like dark tonics, the Kid can just convey a specific number of wellbeing tonics at any given moment, and can recharge them by discovering more in the dimensions. 

Levels contain a wide range of condition types, including urban areas, timberlands, and swamps. Toward the finish of most dimensions, the player gathers a thing called a center or a shard; once in a while, the dimension starts to deteriorate once the Kid takes the thing, compelling him to quickly withdraw. As the player advances through the dimensions, a voice portrays their activities. This portrayal gives scripted plot data just as unique remarks, for example, on the player's aptitude with a weapon or act while battling adversaries. 

Between levels, the Kid visits the Bastion, where the player can utilize piecesâthe amusement's type of cashâthat they have collected to purchase materials and update weapons. With each center the player gathers, they can add one of six structures to the Bastion, for example, a hallowed place, an arsenal, or a refinery, and every shard enables the player to extend a structure. Each structure fills an alternate need; for instance, the refinery gives the player a chance to choose updates, and the place of worship enables the player to pick icons of the divine beings to summon, making the adversaries become more grounded and giving the player expanded experience focuses and cash. Experience indicates are utilized decide the Kid's capacity level; higher qualities give the player more wellbeing and increment the quantity of updates they can choose. 

At whatever point the player leaves the Bastion, they can pick between a couple of customary dimensions to play. Notwithstanding these dimensions, nonetheless, the Kid can take part in test courses intended to test the player's aptitudes with the weapons the player has found. They are called Proving Grounds. The difficulties contrast contingent upon the weapon, for example, annihilating a specific number of items inside a given time or breaking focuses in the least shots conceivable. As per the player's score, diverse levels of prizes are granted. Furthermore, the Kid can battle influxes of foes while the storyteller advises a character's backstory by venturing to "Who Knows Where" from the Bastion. The back story fights happen amid 'Recollections.' The player gains parts and experience for each finished wave. After the amusement is finished, the player can start "another game+" mode, where the player replays through the diversion while keeping the experience focuses, pieces, and weapons that they have picked up. This mode likewise offers more alternatives in the structures, just as two more voyages to "Who Knows Where". 

The diversion happens in the repercussions of the Calamity, a disastrous occasion that all of a sudden broke the city of Caelondia () just as the encompassing regions of the amusement's reality into many gliding pieces, upsetting its nature and decreasing the vast majority of its kin to fiery remains. Players assume responsibility for the Kid, a quiet hero who stirs on one of only a handful few residual bits of the old world and embarks for the eponymous Bastion, where everybody should go in beset times. The main survivor he meets there is an old man named Rucks, the diversion's storyteller, who educates him to gather the Cores that once controlled Caelondia. A gadget in the Bastion can utilize the intensity of the crystalline Cores to make landmasses and structures, just as empower the Kid to travel more remote away from home by means of "skyways" that push him through the air. 

Amid his journey, the Kid meets two additional survivors: Zulf, a minister from the Ura, underground-staying individuals with whom Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, a Ura young lady who was brought up in Caelondia. Them two come back to the Bastion, however after perusing a diary that the Kid finds, Zulf purposefully harms portions of the Bastion's focal gadget (the landmark) and comes back to Ura region. The Kid discovers that the diary had a place with Zia's dad, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian researchers ("Mancers") manufacture a weapon planned to decimate the Ura totally to keep another war. Venn fixed the weapon to reverse discharge, with the goal that when he was at long last compelled to trigger it, the subsequent Calamity demolished a large portion of Caelondia also. 

To fix Zulf's harm to the Bastion, the Kid begins gathering Shards, a lesser type of Cores. As he gets the penultimate shard required, the Ura assault the Bastion, harming it and snatching Zia. In the following seven days, The Kid takes part in sporadic conflicts in Ura domain. When he at last impacts through a Ura station and meets Zia, she reveals to him that she had left with the Ura willfully to discover their goals; Rucks had recently disclosed to Zia that the Bastion had the capacity to by one way or another fix the Calamity. The Kid goes to the once-underground Ura country to recover the last shard. There, he finds Zulf being assaulted by his own kin: the fight with the Kid has crushed the Ura powers, and they fault Zulf for conveying the Kid to their home. The Kid can drop his weapon to help Zulf or abandon him. In the event that he abandons Zulf, the Kid pulverizes the leftovers of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. On the off chance that he conveys Zulf, Ura bowmen at first open flame on them at the end of the day truce and watch quietly as the Kid and Zulf return the skyway to the Bastion. 

After the Kid returns and recuperates, Rucks gives him another decision: He can have the Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity with expectations of anticipating it, or use it to clear the survivors and proceed onward to some place safe. Rucks is uncertain if there is any approach to keep the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as there was no real way to test the procedure. The diversion closes in any case, appearing of the characters (with the incorporation of Zulf if the player rescueed him) taking off or of their lives before the Calamity alongside the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is opened in the wake of beating the diversion once, it is implied that reestablishing the world didn't keep the Calamity. 

"Bastion" was made by a group of seven individuals, who formed the studio Supergiant Games. It was the organization's first amusement. The diversion was coordinated by Amir Rao and Greg Kasavin composed the amusement's portrayal, which was spoken by Logan Cunningham. Jen Zee was the craftsman, Gavin Simon built up the interactivity, Andrew Wang built up the amusement, and Darren Korb took care of the audio effects and music. The prime supporters of Supergiant Games, Rao and Simon, recently worked for Electronic Arts, where they created "" and "". They left to frame the studio since they needed the improvement speed and the capacity to attempt new thoughts that would be conceivable with a littler group. Advancement started on the amusement in September 2009. The group made the diversion over right around two years, and subsidized the advancement themselves. The majority of the group constructed the amusement in a house in San Jose, however the music and voice acting were recorded in New York City. A portion of the San Jose plannersâincluding the essayistâdid not meet Rucks' voice performer face to face until close to the arrival of the amusement. The group went through the initial nine months of advancement prototyping different thoughts, before settling on the diversion's plan. 

The first thought was based around the reason of making a town like those found in a pretending amusement. The group picked the structure components of a broke, coasting world because of their desire to depict a sky in the amusement, which is generally unrealistic with an isometric camera, as it generally focuses down. They additionally needed to renounce a guide framework, and felt that having the ground come up to the Kid enabled the player to effectively observe without a guide where they had just been in a dimension. The tale of the Calamity was made as an approach to clarify this diversion specialist. Jen Zee built up the craftsmanship style of the amusement to express magnificence in a dystopian scene. The hand-painted style was proposed to diminish the sharpness she saw as ordinary in isometric diversions and the dull, unforgiving delineations of most crushed scenes. Zee was propelled by the pixel workmanship scenes of prior Japanese isometric recreations. 

The storyteller was included right off the bat in the amusement's improvement as an approach to give foundation subtleties and profundity to the world without requiring the player to peruse long strings of content or hold up through cutscenes. To abstain from moderating the pace of the activity situated interactivity, the group had the storyteller mostly talk to put it plainly, suggestive expressions, with long stops between talking parts. The storyteller is expected to feel like an "old associate" to the player, an association worked by his critique on the player's activities as they occur, both major and minor. Kasavin looked to make the diversion feel as though it were the player's story, instead of only a story being viewed. The improvement of "Bastion" was chronicled in the month to month Building the Bastion video arrangement from October 2010 to May 2011 in which Supergiant Games teamed up with Kasavin's previous GameSpot collaborators at Giant Bomb. The recordings demonstrated early diversion ideas notwithstanding the way toward structure the last amusement, just as meetings with the group.

After a solid appearing at the March 2011 Game Developers Conference, Warner Bros. Intuitive Entertainment marked on to distribute and circulate the amusement. The group chose to join forces with a distributer so as to get past the procedure of Xbox Live affirmation.

An adaptation for Mac OS X was made accessible by means of the Mac App Store on April 26, 2012 alongside a SteamPlay update for Mac OS X and Windows. 

"Bastion"s soundtrack was created and formed by Darren Korb, a musician and arranger. He was chosen to pen the soundtrack by Rao, who was a cherished companion of Korb. "Bastion" was the main computer game that Korb had scored; preceding it he had dealt with a couple of littler TV programs and motion pictures. He was brought onto the group in the first place phases of the undertaking, and a few of the pieces he created were made preceding the last plan of the dimensions with which they were related. The melodic style of the soundtrack has been depicted by Korb as "acoustic outskirts trip jump". It was planned to inspire both the American wilderness and a fascinating dreamland. The tunes consolidate "vigorously inspected beats in layers, alongside acoustic components", and he confirmed that he needed to make the soundtrack in that style as it was unique in relation to video amusement soundtracks that he had heard previously. The music was recorded in Korb's storeroom at his New York City condo, similar to the audio effects and in excess of three thousand lines of portrayal by Cunningham. 

Notwithstanding forming the music, Korb composed every one of the verses for the soundtrack. The soundtrack highlights four vocal subjects: "Assemble That Wall", "What's Left Undone", "Mother, I'm Here", and "Setting Sail, Coming Home". "Fabricate That Wall" includes the voice of Ashley Lynn Barrett, "What's Left Undone" highlights that of Cunningham and "Mother, I'm Here" highlights Korb, and both Korb and Barrett perform in "Setting Sail, Coming Home". Supergiant Games initially had not wanted to discharge a full soundtrack collection for the amusement, however because of fan request they discharged one in computerized position on August 5, 2011, with two melodies not heard in the diversion. These melodies are "Become accustomed to It", which has a voiceover composed by Greg Kasavin and spoken by Logan Cunningham, and "The Pantheon (Ain't Gonna Catch You)", with verses composed by Korb and sung by Cunningham.

Ryan Scott of GameSpy, in any case, named it an "only sorta-there plot", and Greg Miller said that it "could have been something more" and never "snared" him. 

Analysts had a progressively blended assessment of the ongoing interaction. Mackey lauded the assortment of ongoing interaction components and said that battle has "a misleading measure of profundity", yet Bramwell felt that the battle did not "welcome experimentation" and was to some degree baffling. "Edge" said that the ongoing interaction was "more inspired by assortment than test", for which he commended it, and Matt Miller said that battle was "a ton of fun", however he felt it did not have "the profundity, speed, or intricacy of a genuine activity diversion".
