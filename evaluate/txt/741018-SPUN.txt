Robin Friday 

Robin Friday (27 July 1952Â â 22 December 1990) was an English footballer who played expertly as a forward for Reading and Cardiff City amid a lifelong that endured four years in the mid-1970s. His on-field exhibitions were viewed as superb, and he won Reading's player of the year grant in both of his full seasons there, just as being the main objective scorer. In any case, his propensity for agitating adversaries through physical terrorizing added to an intensely discolored disciplinary record, and his own life was one of substantial smoking, drinking, womanizing and tranquilize misuse. In spite of his short profession, he stays conspicuous in the memory of Reading and Cardiff supporters, both as a player and an identity. He has been casted a ballot Reading's best ever player multiple times. 

Brought up in Acton, west London, Friday was explored, however not held, by four expert clubs amid his adolescent years. He showed up for neighborhood semi-proficient sides in the Isthmian League until he joined Charlie Hurley's Fourth Division Reading group in 1974ârapidly turning into a key player, he helped Reading to win advancement to the Third Division amid the 1975â 76 season. As his medication propensity heightened, Friday's structure started to plunge in the principal half of the 1976â 77 season, driving Reading to pitch him to Second Division side Cardiff City around the New Year. Friday went to join his new group via train without a legitimate ticket and must be safeguarded by the Cardiff director Jimmy Andrews before he marked for the club. He performed emphatically on his presentation, however a short time later his structure declined and his own life made him more than once miss coordinates through and through. Following various episodes, on and off the fieldâincorporating kicking Mark Lawrenson in the face â Friday resigned from football in December 1977, matured 25. He kicked the bucket in Acton in 1990, matured 38, in the wake of enduring a heart assault. 

The most grounded parts of Friday's diversion were his ball aptitudes, footballing insight and physical and mental quality. Andrews named Friday "the total focus forward", and, alongside various peers, reflectively evaluated Friday as adequate for the England national group. In a 2004 BBC survey, Friday was casted a ballot the top "unsurpassed clique saint" for both Reading and Cardiff City. The Cardiff-based band Super Furry Animals devoted their 1996 single "The Man Don't Give a Fuck" to his memory. 

Robin Friday and his twin sibling, Tony, were conceived in Acton, west London, on 27 July 1952. Their folks, Alf Friday, a driver for a clothing firm, and his significant other Sheila, were both conceived in Acton and had hitched a year prior, both matured 20, having met three years sooner. Sheila's dad, Frederick Riding, had played proficient football for Brentford before the Second World War. The Fridays lived with Sheila's family until moving into their very own prefab in Acton Green when Robin and Tony were matured two; they moved to a maisonette in South Acton in 1962 when it was discovered that the prefab was sinking. Robin and Tony were later depicted by their mom as having been strikingly close, once in a while contending or battling. A recognizable contrast in identity was that Robin was modest, while Tony was progressively certain. The twins went to their first expert match at two years old, when their dad took them to a Brentford coordinate at Griffin Park. From the age of four Alf took both young men to play football at a neighborhood park each evening. 

Around the age of ten, Friday had eminent ball-aptitudes, and as indicated by his dad could flick an orange up onto his neck, balance it and afterward given it a chance to move it down his body and catch it on his foot. Just as football, Robin played cricket to an exclusive requirement, boxed and played tennis. Regardless of their numerous likenesses and regular enthusiasm for games and football specifically, the twins were fiercely extraordinary in scholastic terms: while Tony found real success at school, Friday was uninterested and as per his sibling "was continually bunking off, having winged animals around the recreation center". 

Friday was explored by various London sides amid his high school years, joining Crystal Palace's school of magnificence at 12 or 13, at that point proceeding onward to Queens Park Rangers matured 13 and afterward to Chelsea, with whom he went to the 1967 FA Cup Final; as one of the club's childhood players, he was a piece of the group's authentic gathering. In any case, Friday's individual style of play and refusal to change his diversion brought about every one of these clubs losing tolerance with him. The twin siblings joined a men's group, the Acton British Legion Reserves, matured 14, and in certain matches would play close by their dad. Tony played in midfield, and Robin in advance, however as per Tony his sibling was preferable as a goalkeeper over a forward: "He was a splendid goalkeeper. He had no dread ... Be that as it may, he clearly favored slamming them in at the opposite end". Around this time Robin ended up intrigued by music, moving and going to shows; he additionally had an ability for illustration, yet all of a sudden surrendered this enthusiasm at 15. Robin turned out to be more friendly than his sibling and began taking medications in his mid-adolescents. He left school at 15, a year prior Tony, and started preparing as a plasterer. 

Friday endured two months as a plasterer before proceeding onward to turn out to be initial a van driver for a basic need firm, at that point a window more clean. His laid-back demeanor and lack of interest was at that point clear: in his dad's words, "he couldn't have cared less". Friday routinely stole at this point, yet regardless of various feelings, did not go to a detainment focus until he was 16. Having been discovered taking what Tony reviewed to be "a vehicle radio or something", he was discharged very quickly in light of the fact that he experienced asthma. Be that as it may, after he re-annoyed three months after the fact he was sent to Feltham Borstal where he served 14 months. Amid his time there, Friday wound up more grounded and fitter and furthermore featured for the Borstal football crew. He was chosen for the jail group's elite player men's group, still matured 16, and permitted out of Borstal to prepare and play with Reading's childhood group, for which he seemed multiple times in the South East Counties League amid the 1968â 69 season. 

After his discharge, Friday came back to Acton, where he had a sweetheart called Maxine Doughan and an infant little girl called Nicola. Maxine was of blended race. The neighborhood debate encompassing the interracial relationship made the couple and their friend network be socially segregated, and prompted a physical assault on the gathering one night in an Acton open house. Notwithstanding this, and the resistance by the two arrangements of guardiansâAlf would not go to the weddingâthey wedded, both matured 17. Friday did not pay attention to his conjugal duties and kept on womanizing, drink intensely and take opiates. A companion who played for Walthamstow Avenue, a semi-proficient Isthmian League club from north-east London, took Friday along to preparing one day in mid 1971. Friday played alright for Walthamstow to sign him that day on wages of Â£10 every week. A considerable lot of his new partners were asphalters from east London, and Friday before long gone along with them in that exchange. 

Friday made his introduction for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971, against Bromley, falling off the seat to set up Walthamstow's equalizer. His first objective went ahead 17 April, when playing against Tooting and Mitcham he indeed showed up as a substitute and scored a header late in the amusement. He joined west London club Hayes in December 1971 in the wake of scoring twice against them in an Isthmian League coordinate. Hayes offered Â£30 every week, and were likewise based nearer to his home in Acton. A close deadly mishap at work in July 1972 made Friday experience broad medical procedure; while dealing with a rooftop in Lambeth, a crane rope wound up stuck on the framework he was taking a shot at. The Hayes forward endeavored to free the rope yet fell and arrived on a huge spike: the spike went up through one of his rump, through his stomach and barely maintained a strategic distance from a lung. In addition to the fact that friday was sufficiently able to pull himself off the spike, he recuperated from his wounds inside three months and came back to the Hayes group in October 1972. 

Friday was known at Hayes for his inordinate drinking, and on one event the group began a match a player short since Friday had not turned up. When he at last arrived, eighty minutes after commencement, his inebriation was self-evident, yet he was as yet sent onto the pitch with the match still goalless. The resistance gave him little consideration and Friday scored a late winning objective. Hayes were attracted to play Football League Fourth Division club Reading in the FA Cup's second round on 9 December 1972; the group figured out how to draw 0â 0 at Reading and acquire the privilege to a replay at home, which they lost 1â 0 three days after the fact. Despite the fact that Hayes had lost, the enthusiasm of Reading supervisor Charlie Hurley was provoked. Hurley went to Hayes more than once to watch Friday. Having examined the player's experience, he was careful about marking him, however was inspired all the equivalent by his on-field exhibitions. 

The 1972â 73 season was Friday's most productive non-League year as far as objectives. He quickly joined Enfield from the get-go in the 1973â 74 season and scored against Hayes in a FA Cup attach before coming back to west London in December 1973. Having additionally been drawn nearer by Third Division side Watford, Friday marked for Hurley's Reading side in January 1974 for Â£750. He had scored 46 objectives in 67 appearances for Hayes over his two spells there, however amid his three Isthmian League seasons had been sent off multiple times. Friday marked as a novice, implying that despite the fact that he would be contracted to Reading he would probably keep showing up for Hayes and filling in as an asphalter in London; he would prepare low maintenance with Reading and play for their hold group. 

In Hurley's words, Friday "prepared like he played"; "he had no other method for playing". His new administrator needed to remove him from preparing every so often due to the wounds he would cause without anyone else partners in his push to win. By late January 1974, Reading were on a kept running of 14 diversions with just two triumphs, while Friday had performed unequivocally in three hold matches. Hurley enrolled the beginner forward to play in the Football League on 23 January 1974 and gave him his first-group debut four days after the fact. Friday turned in an exhibition against Northampton Town at Elm Park that the "Perusing Evening Post" called "remarkable" as Reading drew 3â 3. The group at that point ventured out to Barnsley on 3 February, having not won far from home in four months. After Barnsley drove 2â 0 at half-time, Friday scored his first League objective with a header soon after the break to make the score 2â 1. Perusing quickly offered an expert contract, which Friday marked on 6 February 1974. His new compensation was half what he had earned as an asphalter. 

Friday's specialized capacity made him exceptionally prevalent among Reading supporters and pressmen alike. The "Perusing Evening Post" report of Reading's 4â 1 triumph over Exeter City on 10 February 1974, Friday's first match as an expert, portrayed his execution as "sheer enchantment" as he scored twice. The report likewise called Friday's first objective of the day "great": he gathered the ball wide on the left wing, took it past four Exeter protectors and after that terminated the ball low and hard into the contrary corner from the edge of the punishment zone. Friday was prominent in the expert positions for never wearing shin cushions, and for his protection from physical damage; regardless of how seriously he was harmed he would dependably get up and proceed. 

In the wake of continuing calf damage against Exeter, he returned for the group's next diversion, away at Lincoln City on 17 February. Friday was more than once and critically fouled by the restricting players and supported wounds requiring five minutes on the sideline late in the principal half. In any case, he recouped, came back to the amusement and set up both Reading objectives as his side won by a score of two objectives to nil. The group's next diversion, on 24 February 1974, was at home against Doncaster Rovers, and with Friday assuming a key job Reading won 5â 0. Specifically, Friday scored an objective following 17 minutes portrayed by the "Night Post" journalist as "otherworldly": with the score 1â 0 to Reading, Friday got the ball close to the edge of the punishment region, at a tight edge, and coolly kicked the ball with the outside of his boot low crosswise over objective, towards the far post. In spite of the fact that it seemed, by all accounts, to be going yards wide of the net, the ball all of a sudden bended in finallyâ"directly around the goalie", in the expression of Reading F.C. student of history David Downsâand cut the goalpost before settling in the back of the net. "The group that has been changed by Robin Friday has now scored a noteworthy 16 objectives in five amusements," announced the "Night Post", "and the feature of this blissful evening was an objective by Friday that merited anybody's confirmation cash without anyone else." 

In spite of his quick effect on the contribute and the upturn Reading's structure, Friday's off-the-field exercises agitated a portion of his partners. Most endured his way of life due to his significance to the group, yet a few, especially safeguard Tommy Youlden, were distrustful. He drank amazingly vigorously, favoring American Colt 45 beer, and his shenanigans amid his drinking sessions made numerous landowners lose tolerance with him. For instance, Friday was banned from Caversham's Crown open house after he finished a night there jumping between the tables and moving on the bar. The Boar's Head in Reading restricted him on ten separate events. One night, after the bars shut, Friday and a companion, Rod Lewington, went to a throughout the dance club called Churchill's the place they could keep drinking. When they entered, Friday, wearing a long jacket and hobnail boots, strolled onto the dancefloor and evacuated the coat to uncover that he was wearing nothing underneath. He at that point started to move, totally exposed separated from the boots. 

Despite the fact that Churchill's, portrayed by Lewington as "the most exceedingly awful club that has ever been in Reading", endured such conduct, the town's stylish Sindlesham Mill dance club did not, normally excepting Friday for his odd exercises, including a move he created called "the elephant" which comprised of turning the pockets of his pants back to front and fixing his flies to uncover himself. He and his companions would consistently drink throughout the day, however he had the capacity to apply some poise; as indicated by his companion Syd Simmonds, Friday would comply with Hurley's guidance not to drink for 48 hours before each diversion. Be that as it may, he would play his prized overwhelming metal records all around boisterously whenever of the day or night and take LSD with easygoing impassion. Hurley endeavored to quiet Friday somewhere near moving him into a loft over the football club's old ex-groundsman, yet without much of any result: "Regardless of whether it was three in the first part of the day, the principal thing is get the music playing", Simmonds later said. "We had an old kid living beneath us ... the ex-groundsman at Reading. He was coming up to 80 and he had a puppy's life in the level. Beating music, individuals thumping on the entryway, young ladies tossing stones at the windows. Poor old grass." 

Perusing completed the 1973â 74 season in 6th position, one spot higher than the earlier year. Friday experienced an activity to have tattoos expelled from his fingers amid the mid year break, and a short time later joined a flower child collective in Cornwall, fail to educate Reading of this last choice. He was missing without clarification when preparing began for the 1974â 75 season in July 1974, arriving just upon the arrival of a shut entryways benevolent against Watford. In spite of his absence of preparing, he out of sight the remainder of the group. He kept on playing great when the League program started the next month. By September 1974 he was drawing in light of a legitimate concern for First Division sides Sheffield United and Arsenal. The previous had been tailing him since the amusement at Barnsley back in February, when he had still been a beginner. Weapons store chief Bertie Mee by and by went to Reading's 4â 2 home success over Rotherham United on 12 September, however neither his group nor Sheffield United endeavored to sign Friday. 

Subsequent to Reading despatched Newport County 3â 0 on 14 September 1974, Friday and his forward accomplice Dick Habbin had scored six objectives each and topped the Football League goalscoring graphs. In any case, in the meantime Friday's disciplinary record was ending up so terrible that even the "Night Post", normally ideal to him, condemned him on 30 September 1974, soon after he had scored his first cap trap for Reading in a 4â 1 triumph over Southport. He was the Football League's joint top scorer at this point with nine objectives, yet he had additionally as of now been reserved multiple times that season and the "Post" contended that by continually gambling suspension he was disappointing the group. Under the framework at that point utilized, the three appointments gave him a programmed two-coordinate suspension. The article contended that missing diversions in view of "totally superfluous" and "inept" infractions added up to undercutting the club. 

Friday's conduct on Reading endlessly trips was eccentric and unpredictable: in the expressions of partner John Murray, "A portion of the things he did were amusing yet different occasions they were simply distraught". In transit once more from one away match, the group transport pulled over and Friday saw that they were adjacent to a burial ground. Friday bounced over the divider and stole some stone heavenly attendants from a grave, planning to put them alongside the club director Frank Waller, who was dozing on the mentor. When he returned, Hurley sternly revealed to him that "you should never under any circumstance despoil a burial ground"â Friday obediently restored the statues. On another event, Friday responded to the news that a partner had carried a young lady into his lodging by kicking the entryway in. Later on that night he strolled into the bar conveying a swan that he had found in the lodging grounds. 

Amid a FA Cup tie away against Swindon Town on 23 November, Friday started to experience difficulty breathing and regardless of leaving the diversion for five minutes to recover with an inhaler was in the long run compelled to fall off for good, hacking brutally. Subsequent to recuperating based on what was accounted for to be a chest contamination, he came back to the group on 28 December, having missed four matches, and denoted his arrival with his side's solitary objective in a 3â 1 home thrashing to Stockport County. Perusing dropped to twelfth spot on 6 January 1975, and were just three over the re-appointment places; be that as it may, when they took on Workington at home on 3 February they had ascended to tenth. Perusing won 3â 0, with Friday scoring the third objective with a tremendous header: "Plunging full length scarcely a foot off the ground, Friday gambled life and appendage to head home a really critical objective", composed the "Night Post" coordinate correspondent. "Consistent with structure, he needed to ruin things for himself by getting booked three minutes after the fact". 

This triumph denoted the start of a keep running of six successes out of seven diversions, after which the side was indeed trying for advancement to the third level, drifting somewhere in the range of 6th and eighth spot for the remainder of the period. By 11 April advancement looked impossible, yet Friday was still excited subsequent to scoring the very late champ in Reading's 2â 1 triumph over Rochdale. In festivity he kept running behind the net and kissed a policeman. "The policeman looked so cold and tired remaining there", clarified the Reading forward, freely, "that I chose to brighten him up a bit." In the changing area after the amusement he stated, secretly, that he wished he hadn't done it "since I loathe coppers to such an extent". Perusing in the end completed the 1974â 75 season in seventh spot, five points behind the advanced groups. Friday was the club's top scorer for the season, with 18 group objectives and 20 by and large, and was casted a ballot its player of the year. 

Friday's fine structure proceeded into the 1975â 76 season; after their 4â 2 triumph over Hartlepool United on 23 September 1975, Reading were top of the Fourth Division having quite recently won four recreations in succession. Friday, in the interim, was the club's top scorer. The following diversion was against Bournemouth on the 27th, and despite the fact that Reading won 2â 1 Friday was sent off following 79 minutes. At this point the forward was overwhelmingly famous among Reading's fans, to whom he charmed himself by playing out a lap of respect after every objective he scored. After a month, after two successes, two annihilations and a draw amid October, the group was fourth in the table. 

Friday was captured after the night coordinate away at Newport County on 20 October, blamed for utilizing foul language outside a Newport club. At his appearance before officers in Newport on 17 November, he argued not blameworthy, speaking to himself, and was absolved. Performing unequivocally to peruse and scoring routinely, he started to pull in genuine enthusiasm from different clubs. "Friday is, obviously, significantly more than Reading's top scorer and best striker", composed the "Night Post" on 3 November 1975. "He is the most essential machine gear-piece in the group, and a week ago I comprehend Reading diverted down a Â£60,000 offer from Cardiff City including Welsh worldwide Derek Showers". By the new year, Reading were third in the table, on course for advancement and two points behind group pioneers Lincoln City. 

Subsequent to Reading went four recreations without a success beginning on 24 January 1976, a late objective from Friday finished this keep running on 25 February, in a home match against Hartlepool United; a short ways from time, he gathered a go from Stewart Henderson and flawlessly set the ball past the goalkeeper from the edge of the punishment territory. "One is progressively under the impression", the "Night Post" detailed, "that if Friday was out for quite a while through damage the Reading group would tumble to pieces". Driven by the free-scoring Friday, the side proceeded with its push for advancement; fourth or higher would be sufficient to go up. A crucial apparatus on 31 March 1976 set fourth-set Reading at home against Tranmere Rovers, who involved third spot; universally experienced official Clive Thomas assumed responsibility for the diversion. Friday, who had just scored 18 objectives that season, rose to the event with an exertion that has been portrayed by numerous sources as one of the best at any point scored. 

With the score 2â 0 to Reading, the goalkeeper Steve Death tossed the ball to one side back Gary Peters, who spotted Friday remaining close to one side hand corner of the contradicting punishment territory. Subsides passed high and corner to corner over the pitch towards his forward, who bounced into the air and utilized his chest to pad the ball and thump it into the air with his back to objective, about 25â 30 yards from the net. As Friday landed, he brutally fueled the ball towards objective, kicking behind him and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the upper right-hand corner of the net, shocking the group, players and Thomas, the official, who put his hands over his head in dismay. "I'll always remember it", Thomas reviewed. "It was the sheer savagery of the shot on the volley ... behind him. ... On the off chance that it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Indeed, even facing any semblance of PelÃ© and Cruyff, that rates as the best objective I have ever observed." Reading proceeded to win 5â 0. When Thomas told Friday after the diversion that he had never observed a superior objective, the Londoner answered, "Truly? You should descend here more regularly, I do that consistently." 

Perusing moved to inside one point of advancement on 19 April 1976 with a 1â 0 home triumph over Brentford. Friday set up the diversion's solitary objective, beating three players before hitting the post with his shot; Ray Hiron scored from the bounce back. Friday scored an incredible left-footed volley amid the main portion of a 2â 2 draw away against Cambridge United two days after the fact. The outcome verified Third Division football for Reading. At the celebratory supper after the diversion, the Reading skipper Gordon Cumming saw some fluted wine glasses, and voiced his reverence: "I wouldn't see any problems a couple of them for home", he said. "Give us a couple of minutes and I'll get them for you", answered Friday. Circumventing the lounge area and picking them off the tables, he stole an entire boxful of the glasses, which he figured out how to escape the lodging and onto the group mentor, however a lot to Cumming's irritation he at that point chose to keep them for himself. With 22 objectives for the year, 21 in the association, Friday was afresh Reading's top goalscorer and for the second back to back season the group's player of the year. 

In the wake of Reading were advanced, Waller met with the players on 4 June 1976 to talk about their agreements for the 1976â 77 season. The wages offered to the Reading players were far lower than they had been anticipating, making the group's assurance fall radically. "We got screwed by the club", midfielder Eamon Dunphy later asserted. "We didn't get what we had been guaranteed." Friday was so annoyed by the low pay offered that he turned in an exchange demand, telling the "Night Post" that the club's chiefs unmistakably did not share his aspiration. "They would be upbeat to walk around in the base portion of the Third Division perpetually", he said. The line over the new contracts proceeded all through the off-season, while Friday arranged his second wedding; he had been formally separated from Maxine following quite a while of partition, and in this manner drew in to Liza Deimel, a Reading-conceived college graduate. After the compensation debate was settled on 5 August, the couple were hitched in Reading three days after the fact. The wedding was shot by Southern Television, before whose cameras Friday, wearing an open-necked tiger-skin-design shirt, dark colored velvet suit and snakeskin boots, sat on the means of the congregation and rolled a joint. Friday had welcomed around two hundred individuals, for the most part companions and relatives from London, who participated in the drinking and medication taking and winding up battling one another and taking the couple's wedding presents, one of which was a huge amount of cannabis. Liza later called the wedding "the most humorous thing ever". "I have been to a couple of weddings", reviewed Rod Lewington, "however never one like that." 

"He lost his direction when we got advancement", Hurley later reflected. "He truly more likely than not praised all through the mid year". Friday announced back for pre-season preparing beaten up pretty bad, and despite the fact that Hurley asserted that Friday was making a decent attempt to recapture wellness, the forward was experiencing difficulty with his asthma, had lost a portion of his pace and was clearly unfit. In spite of the fact that his exhibitions amid August immediately improved, they were as yet not up to his past standard and the "Night Post" uncovered on the 30th that Reading were planning to pitch him "to a First Division club". In the wake of scoring in two progressive Reading home successes on 4 and 7 September, against Walsall and Wrexham separately, Friday participated in a third back to back triumph on the thirteenth, away against Northampton Town. After this he missed two matches, as per the "Post" since he was experiencing influenza, and when he came back to the group was a long way from his best; "All of a sudden he had lost a yard and his control of the ball was not as great", Hurley reviewed. 

Hurley was at this point mindful that his forward was utilizing medications, and endeavored to keep his player's propensity a mystery while he calmly attempted to bring him back around. In any case, Friday started to normally miss preparing and Hurley's nuance was confused as inaction by the other Reading players, who ended up disrupted and whined about Friday's lead. The club turned out to be progressively disapproved to offer him, yet albeit top-flight clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United were intrigued, they were hesitant to purchase as a result of Friday's demeanor; in Downs' words, "They didn't know they could deal with him". Before the finish of October 1976, Hurley had abandoned endeavoring to restore his player, trusting that the main arrangement was to pitch him to a greater group. "The squad needs you however I owe it to the club since I can't make them use drugs," Hurley told Friday. "In the event that "I" realize you're utilizing drugs it won't take "them" [the major clubs] long to discover. You must start acting responsibly." Friday was made accessible for exchange, at his very own solicitation, on 28 October. 

Friday was viewed by different clubs all through November and December 1976, yet despite the fact that he performed well in certain diversions, including a 1â 1 draw away at Crystal Palace on 6 November in which he scored his group's solitary objective, he was poor in others. In the wake of being set apart out of the diversion amid Reading's 4â 0 misfortune away against Mansfield Town on 8 November, he was substituted. "Incident or not", composed the "Night Post", "when Friday left, so did about six directors and scouts". Friday was so irate at his group's execution that he broke into the Mansfield changing area and pooped in the group shower. Perusing's asking cost remained at Â£50,000, and the principal exchange offer originated from Second Division side Cardiff City around mid-December. Cardiff manager Jimmy Andrews offer Â£28,000, half of his offer a year prior to, which Reading's executives acknowledged, needing the troublesome player off their hands as fast as could be allowed. Friday was hesitant to go to the Welsh club, saying that it was excessively a long way from home, that he needed to go to a First Division group and that he needed more cash than was being offered; notwithstanding, when Hurley revealed to him that except if he went to Cardiff he would be discharged, he concurred and headed out to Wales on 30 December 1976. 

On landing in Cardiff Central railroad station, Friday was captured by the British Transport Police for having gone from Reading with just a stage ticket. Andrews safeguarded his new player out of police guardianship and took him to Ninian Park to sign the agreement. Notwithstanding the way of Friday's entry, and in spite of the fact that he knew there "must be some kind of problem with him", the Cardiff chief was as yet content with his buy, depicting the Â£28,000 exchange as "an outright take". In the wake of a difficult night of drinking the night prior to his Cardiff debut, Friday arranged against Fulham on 1 January 1977. The Fulham guard included previous England commander Bobby Moore, however Friday denoted his first counterpart for the Welsh club with two objectives; he likewise pressed Moore's balls amid the amusement as Cardiff won 3â 0. Andrews was so content with Friday's execution that he called Hurley two days after the fact, on Monday morning. "Gracious, Charlie", Andrews spouted, "he was brilliant. He removed them inside. ... Moore was pursuing him everywhere". The Cardiff chief kept on storing acclaim on his new obtaining until Hurley at long last ceased him. "Jimmy, you've just had him four days", he cautioned, sombrely: "Give it a couple months"... 

Friday's structure declined after his solid introduction and his own life stayed vexed and disorderly, driving him to disappear routinely and miss Cardiff matches. He should live in Bristol, yet his chief would frequently discover on visiting his home that he had been somewhere else for quite a long time. Leslie Hamilton, the Cardiff club specialist, later said that he had accepted at the time that Andrews was being very delicate on Friday; without a doubt, as indicated by colleague Paul Went, the forward would just leave after each match and not be known about until he returned for the following diversion. "He wouldn't significantly try to have a shower", Went later stated, in a meeting. "He'd simply get dressed, take his transporter pack with his dry martini and he'd goâno clarification". 

While Hurley had the capacity to direction Friday's regard, it before long turned out to be evident that Andrews was unfit to control him and that the Londoner disdained his new supervisor. Surely, not long after in the wake of moving to Cardiff, Friday seemed one day in Hurley's office at Elm Park requesting to return to Reading. "Despite everything he called me manager", Hurley reviewed. "I can't play for that little knave", Friday told Hurley, alluding to Andrews. "You're the person who is by all accounts ready to get me right. Would i be able to return to you?" Hurley answered that despite the fact that he would be upbeat to have Friday back in the group, the club couldn't stand to reimburse the Â£28,000 exchange expense to Cardiff, so he would need to return and keep playing there. Miserable living so distant from home, Friday started to make a trip back to London at ends of the week; he abstained from paying rail passages by thumping on bolted can entryways and yelling, "Tickets, kindly professing to be the ticket controller. At the point when the inhabitant passed his ticket under the way to be checked, Friday would lift it up, stroll off and use it for himself. Paul Went likewise reviewed an occurrence amid preparing when he had tossed a ball out from objective and inadvertently hit Friday on the back of the head. A player remaining close to the forward began snickering, driving Friday to reason that he had tossed the ball.

He was aided this by a smooth and compelling sliding tackle which notwithstanding the majority of Friday's assaulting abilities Hurley thought about one of the most grounded pieces of his amusement. Perusing F.C. history specialist David Downs portrayed Friday's style of play as "actually very peculiar. It was pretty much Robin remaining in the center and saying 'Give me the ball and I'll see what I can do with it'".
