Following the end of their past gathering Pantera, siblings Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul Abbott needed to begin another band. The pair enrolled previous Diesel Machine and Halford guitarist Pat Lachman on vocals, and later Bob Zilla on bass. Damageplan discharged their solitary studio collection "Recently discovered Power" in the United States on February 10, 2004, which appeared at number 38 on the "Announcement" 200, selling 44,676 duplicates in its first week. 

While Damageplan was advancing the collection at a show on December 8, 2004 at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio, a man named Nathan Gale got in front of an audience, slaughtered guitarist Dimebag Darrell and three others, and injured another seven preceding being lethally shot by a cop. Albeit no rationale was discovered, a few observers guaranteed Gale reprimanded the siblings for Pantera's separation and trusted that they had stolen his verses. The band's chief affirmed there are unreleased Damageplan accounts, in spite of the fact that they have not surfaced, and the band has been idle since the occurrence. Paul and Zilla had joined the band Hellyeah (until the previous' demise in 2018), and Lachman joined the Mercy Clinic. 

By 2003, drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell were tormented with troubles that their past metal band, Pantera, was encountering. Both depicted the execution dimension of Pantera's vocalist, Phil Anselmo, as "hit and miss, contingent upon what sort of synthetic concoctions he was on". Following the arrival of Pantera's 2000 collection "Reevaluating the Steel" and the ensuing visit, Anselmo and bassist Rex Brown began to concentrate on their side tasks, and did not talk about or record any further Pantera material, while Darrell and Paul needed to proceed to compose and play music. Both Abbott siblings thought the time had come to proceed onward, and, after disbanding Pantera, they started composing new material. 

A demo of the tune "Creep" was sent to previous Halford guitarist Pat Lachman who tried out as vocalist. Lachman was contracted, and New Found Power was shaped in mid 2003 with previous Jerry Cantrell guitarist Shawn Matthews on bass at first, who was supplanted after the collection recording with the siblings' tattoo craftsman, Bob Zilla. When composing music, Paul guaranteed; "we put no limits on itÂ ... we needed it to be assorted", and Darrell said "We needed to extend and grow our abilities to their fullest." The band changed its name to Damageplan and chose to name the primary collection "Freshly discovered Power". 

The single "Spare Me" appeared on American radio on January 26, 2004, and the band's presentation collection, "Newly discovered Power", was discharged in the United States on February 10. The collection was recorded at the siblings' patio studio, Chasin' Jason, in Arlington, Texas, where past Pantera collections were likewise recorded. The Abbott siblings discovered that amid account, everybody was eager to contribute and "put 100% exertion into it" while with Pantera, yet they discovered it too hard to even think about having Anselmo in the chronicle studio. Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour, Zakk Wylde of Black Label Society, and Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains showed up on the tracks "Screw You", "Soul Bleed", and the reward track "Fiery debris to Ashes" individually, and Sterling Winfield took care of co-creation obligations. 

"Newly discovered Power" sold 44,676 duplicates in its first week to make a big appearance at number 38 on the "Bulletin" 200. The collection got blended surveys from music pundits; Christine Klunk of PopMatters remarked "I'm not at all piece keen on where this band goes or what new and energizing ways they'll consider to manhandle the audience members," while Johnny Loftus of AllMusic felt it was a "bursting fresh start". 

Alice in Chains' vocalist/guitarist Jerry Cantrell went to a Thanksgiving party facilitated by the Abbott siblings. Darrell and Paul had a demo of the main melody they composed, titled "Fiery remains to Ashes". Lachman demanded that it was on the "backburner" until Cantrell demonstrated intrigue. The band entered the Abbott siblings' patio studio with Cantrell to record "Fiery debris to Ashes". In spite of the fact that the tune was not finished so as to be highlighted on "Freshly discovered Power", it was incorporated on the Japanese variant, and for the soundtrack "". To advance "Newly discovered Power", the band visited with Hatebreed, Drowning Pool, and Unearth on the second portion of the Headbangers Ball. 

On December 8, 2004, the band was on a visit at Alrosa Villa, a Columbus, Ohio dance club. Minutes into the show, Nathan Gale, a 25-year-old previous Marine, climbed onto the stage, drew his 9 mm Beretta M9, and shot Dimebag Darrell in the head multiple times, killing him in a split second. Head of Security for the band Jeffery "Pandemonium" Thompson occupied with hand-to-hand battle with Gale, which enabled Paul and different individuals to get away. Be that as it may, Thompson was shot and murdered. A fan named Nathan Bray, who endeavored to offer CPR to Thompson and Dimebag Darrell, and Erin Halk, a U.S. Marine-turned-roadie who attempted to stop Gale while he was reloading, were both shot and murdered also. When the police arrived, Columbus Police officer James Niggemeyer moved toward the phase from the side, and saw Gale holding his weapon to a prisoner. Niggemeyer slaughtered Gale with a solitary shotgun impact to the head. Fifteen shots were discharged by Gale, and an extra 36 rounds were found at his ownership. 

A police examination did not locate any thought process behind the shooting, in spite of the fact that Gale's mom expressed that he was determined to have jumpy schizophrenia, and that he trusted the Abbott siblings had stolen his verses while endeavoring to take his character. She was ignorant if her child took the prescription he was given for his condition, however was pleased with his military administration following his release, and had given him the weapon that was utilized in the shooting. Significant Jason Johnston, a Marine Corps representative at The Pentagon, was unfit to remark on Gale's release. 

An establishment called The Dimebag Darrell Memorial Fund was established after the occurrence, which gave its benefits to cover restorative costs of drum professional John Brooks and visit administrator Chris Paluska, who were among those harmed amid the shooting. An open dedication administration for Darrell occurred on December 14, 2004 at Arlington Convention Center in Arlington, Texas. Numerous artists paid tribute to Darrell on message sheets and at live exhibitions. 

In May 2005, Niggemeyer was called before a fantastic jury, which was gathered by the Franklin County investigator's office to look at the moves made the evening of Dimebag Darrell's end, a standard practice when dangerous power is utilized. The jury found that there was no bad behavior on Niggemeyer's part. Franklin County examiner Ron O'Brien remarked, "There was little uncertainty [the shooting] was legitimate, given the 200 observers and the conditions that encompassed the shooting. By the by, despite everything we have an autonomous body survey the certainties". Niggemeyer was named for a valiance grant on the TV show "America's Most Wanted". 

In a 2005 meeting, Damageplan administrator Paul Bassman said that unreleased chronicles before Darrell's passing were close finish. He remarked, "Vinnie Paul has said there will be a subsequent collection not far off, as Dime would have needed his music to be heard." Rumors circled of another collection, albeit nothing has been discharged. 

Following the occasions since Dimebag Darrell's passing, Paul was uncertain on the off chance that he needed to keep playing music. He was welcome to join the band called Hellyeah, which included individuals from Mudvayne and Nothingface, however declined the offer. Be that as it may, bassist Jerry over and over called Paul, and he acknowledged to join the undertaking as he suspected "Everyone had their head in the ideal spot." Hellyeah discharged its introduction collection on April 10, 2007. Multi week later, Zilla joined the band as its new bassist, after left because of "individual reasons". The collection was recorded at Abbott's lawn studio, Chasin' Jason, where "Freshly discovered Power" was likewise recorded. 

Vocalist Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic, which supported the lamenting procedure. He remarked, "you need to get back on the pony. You could undoubtedly release 10 years by and not do anything. I'm cheerful to have left with my life after the circumstance I was tossed into. However, I mean, what do you do? I'm an artist. I'm going to make music. What Dime would have let me know was, 'You make music, mother lover. Get back on it. Do what you do.' So, that is the thing that I did." Before the shooting, Phil Anselmo owned to some degree a questionable expression by saying "Dimebag has the right to be seriously beaten" in the December 2004 version of "Metal Hammer". He denied making the remarks and apologized, despite the fact that Paul mentioned "Metal Hammer" to give the sound tapes to demonstrate the validness of what Anselmo said. Paul found the statement bona fide and alluded to him as the "ace of untruths". 

A book titled "A Vulgar Display of Power: Courage and Carnage at the Alrosa Villa" was written by writer Chris Armold. For 14Â months, Armold talked with individuals and inquired about the occasions paving the way to December 8, expressing "It is anything but a book about demigods, yet legends, customary folks who made a definitive penance." In his examination, Armold found no proof that the remarks Anselmo made before Darrell's passing had affected Gale's activities. The book was discharged in 2007. 

In a 2017 meeting with Loudwire, Paul had expressed that he had wanted to discharge all unreleased Damageplan chronicles sooner or later, a considerable lot of which have no vocals. He even expressed having some of Dimebag Darrell's most loved artists, for example, Rob Halford of Judas Priest to record vocals for the tunes. 

Paul kicked the bucket on June 22, 2018, at 54 years old. 

As indicated by Johnny Loftus of AllMusic, Damageplan joined components of customary substantial metal, post-grunge, metalcore, and passing metal. Damageplan's sound has been portrayed as furrow metal, nu metal and whip metal. 

The melodious procedure was a cooperative exertion comprising of Paul, Darrell, and Lachman. Topics investigated on the collection incorporated the siblings' encounters, Darrell remarked, "the disintegrating of one realm and after that beginning overÂ ... So there are a great deal of verses about being renewed one might say, about it being another day, pushing ahead, relinquishing the past and getting to be something new." This is exemplified in the melodies "Reawakened", "Wake Up", and "Breathing New Life". "Gruff Force Trauma" is about when a person or thing comes up behind you when you wouldn't dare hoping anymore, "could be a circumstance in your life, it could be an individual you know with a brew bottle". 

When composing music, the Abbott siblings recommended guitar riffs and "notches", while Lachman added his contribution to adjust the melody's structure. The band's sound has been portrayed by music commentators to be like Pantera. Christine Klunk of "PopMatters" loathed the similitudes and remarked, "beside a consistent, driving mood, dreary riffs, and ambiguous verses about (I'm expecting) kicking assâthere's nothing important to focus on". The tune "Breathing New Life" highlights 180 thumps for each moment bass drum accelerating, what Vik Bansal of MusicOMH depicted as "detonating into a burst of riffage and a cool chorale". Bansal was inspired with specific components of the melody, for example, the change from downbeat singing to "a major theme stopped in power harmony paradise", and the fused depression rhythms. Be that as it may, he felt Dimebag "borrow[ed]" Anthrax's guitar solo from the melody "As it were".
