We will battle at our own secondary passage. That is the thing that we need to get ready for." In August that year he was exchanged to the fourth Light Horse Regiment at Warrnambool, Victoria, as auxiliary/officer.

The battle was questionable in that it seemed to have little effect on the principle drive against Japan; Garrett was cited as calling it "a flat out exercise in futility". 

Garrett was designated a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his "expertise, bearing, and supervision of the most elevated request" in having "arranged and guided all staff work to meet each possible necessity in the total redesign of powers in New Guinea"; the respect was proclaimed in "The London Gazette" on 19 July 1945. Garrett was likewise in charge of cross examining the primary Japanese harmony agent to reach the Australians on Bougainville, on 18 August 1945, and was available when the instrument of surrender was marked on 8 September. In November 1945, he took direction of the eighth Brigade in New Guinea. He supervised the unit's arrival to Australia before its disbandment in March 1946. His "outstanding administration in the field" in the South West Pacific Area earned him a notice in despatches, which was gazetted on 6Â March 1947 and predated to 2 November 1946. 

Following a three-month course at the Staff College, Camberley, Garrett was selected commandant of the Staff College, Queenscliff, Victoria, in June 1946. He was presented on Japan in March 1947, getting to be Brigadier-in-Charge of Administration for the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in July. The size and extent of the occupation declined extensively amid his visit, which completed in October 1949. Around 2,400 Australians, most from the 67th Battalion, stayed by late 1948, contrasted with 11,000 in October 1946. In December 1949, Garrett continued order of the Staff College, Queenscliff. Advanced impermanent significant general, he was designated General Officer Commanding (GOC) Western Command, which secured the province of Western Australia, in August 1951. He moved toward becoming Deputy Chief of the General Staff in February 1953.

The Army experienced critical change amid Garrett's term as CGS. In March 1959, he led the principal meeting of the Military Board at the new Army Headquarters in Canberra, following its turn from Melbourne. Alan Stretton, official officer to the Military Board at the time, reviewed Garrett's comical inclination and "most casual" way. In August, the CGS declared to his senior officers an extreme revamping of the Army that would reinforce the ordinary powers and decrease dependence on the CMF, which since Federation had framed the foundation of Australia's military. This arrangement incorporated the abrogation of National Service, to which the Federal government had officially concurred, and the presentation of a "pentropic" divisional structure. Garrett supported the pentropic structure to conquer what he saw as the shortcoming of the customary force for abroad arrangements, and to guarantee similarity with the US Army's pentomic developments. The Australian Army's conventional "triangular" divisional structure of three infantry forces under a detachment home office was to be supplanted with an association comprising of five bigger units (subsequently "pentropic") without a unit layer among division and legion central command. The arrangement was restricted by CMF officers as it would result in the disbandment of the residents' detachments and huge numbers of the old volunteer army brigades. Under the new structure the CMF would not just therapist, its units would lose conventional connections to neighborhood networks through the foundation of new multi-contingent state-based regiments, prompting doubt in certain quarters that the whole procedure was intended to decimate the CMF. 

Garrett was concerned with changing the Army's association as well as with redesigning its hardware; by the mid 1960s the Army would secure the FN 7.62mm rifle, the M60 assault rifle, the M101 105mm howitzer, the M113 heavily clad faculty bearer, and new mortars and radios. He likewise supported firmly for the Army to work its own helicopters and light flying machine; the Australian Army Aviation Corps was in the long run set up in July 1968. Garrett was booked to resign from the Army on his sixtieth birthday celebration in February 1960 yet the legislature expanded his term. He resigned on 30 June 1960 and was prevailing by Lieutenant General Reg Pollard, whom Garrett had prescribed for the post despite resistance from the Minister for the Army, John Cramer, who had endeavored to choose Major General Ivan Dougherty, a resigned CMF officer. In spite of the fact that Garrett's proposed redesign of the Army along pentropic lines proceeded under Pollard, it demonstrated fleeting. The US Army relinquished the framework in June 1961, and the Australian Army came back to the triangular arrangement following an audit appointed by Pollard's successor as CGS, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in October 1964. 

On resigning from the military, Garrett progressed toward becoming main of the Australian Administrative Staff College, a private establishment conveying courses to senior business and government work force at Mount Eliza, Victoria. Amid his four-year residency, he campaigned for the reintroduction of induction, and when the Federal government got another particular administration plot in 1965, he was welcome to draw the main ticket of names. Garrett additionally prescribed that the Army ought to have a division arranged for war consistently. He filled in as privileged colonel of the Royal Australian Regiment and the Royal Western Australia Regiment from 1960 until 1965, when he was delegated Chairman of the Western Australian Coastal Shipping Commission, a position he held until 1970. He passed on 4 November 1977 at Mornington, Victoria, and was incinerated. His better half had kicked the bucket before, and he was made due by his two kids.
