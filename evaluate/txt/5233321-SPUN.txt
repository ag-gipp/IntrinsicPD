In July 1877, a brutal railroad strike started in Martinsburg, West Virginia, starting mobs in other American urban areas, for example, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, and President Rutherford B. Hayes approved the utilization of the military accordingly. Tilley was incidentally exchanged to amid the emergency, cruising up the Potomac River to Washington, D.C. Military pioneers expected that agitators from Baltimore could head out to Washington to seize or harm powerless government targets. The troops shielding Washington incorporated the military, naval force, and marines sorted out into a unit of seven organizations (Naval Brigade) under the direction of Captain Edward Barrett; Tilley was set in order of Company C. The precautionary measures ended up being pointless, as the normal flood of agitators never appeared following the military's concealment of the strikers in Baltimore; the mobs were additionally suppressed in different urban areas inside a brief span. 

After the strike, Tilley was exchanged to the leader before mentioning to take a six-month leave with the goal that he could wed. On June 6, 1878, he wedded Emily Edelin Williamson, the little girl of a Navy specialist, and left with her on an all-encompassing vacation in Europe. On his arrival to obligation, Tilley served at the United States Naval Academy and stayed there until 1882, either in a study hall or on a preparation transport. For the following three years, he served on board . In 1885, he was elevated to lieutenant leader and came back to instruct at the foundation. Amid his residency there, he was delegated leader of the Department of Astronomy, Navigation, and Surveying, and after that exchanged to move toward becoming leader of the Department of Mechanical Drawing. In September 1889, he moved to the Washington Navy Yard to instruct arms. 

In 1890, Tilley was exchanged to San Francisco to help test the recently fabricated and to turn into her official officer. "San Francisco" transported troops to the port of ValparaÃ­so amid the 1891 Chilean Civil War, from which they could proceed onward to ensure the American office in the capital of Santiago. Agitators caught the city, and Tilley stayed to protect the department with a power of 100 men. After the war, he came back to the maritime institute as leader of the space science and route office. In 1896, he took order of and cruised on a review voyage through maritime yards along the east bank of the United States. He was elevated to administrator that October. In 1897, he was given direction of to sail to Nicaragua to assess the advancement of the isthmus waterway commission. 

On April 23, 1898, Spain proclaimed war on the United States because of American endeavors to help Cuban freedom. Tilley was in the Caribbean in order of "Newport" and in the core of the contention territory. The United States reacted with its very own affirmation of war against Spain on April 25, and Tilley caught the Spanish Navy's sloop "Paquete" and yacht "Pireno" after two days. He took an interest in the maritime bar of Santiago de Cuba yet missed the ensuing Battle of Santiago de Cuba, as "Newport" was refueling at GuantÃ¡namo Bay when battling broke out. Close to the finish of the war, he was in charge of shelling the Cuban port of Manzanillo. He and "Newport" aided the catch of nine Spanish vessels, and he was exchanged to the Newport Naval Yard at the finish of the war, at that point given the order of in October. 

The United States previously communicated enthusiasm for structure a maritime station at Pago, Samoa in 1872 at the command of Henry A. Peirce, the United States Minister to Hawaii. A bargain with that impact was composed and submitted, yet it was not affirmed by the United States Senate. On February 13, 1878, a different arrangement was sanctioned by the Senate that allowed the Samoan government strategic acknowledgment and reaffirmed consent to manufacture a maritime station in the nation. There were no further political deterrents, yet financing for the station was not designated and just a little coaling station was based on the island. Development of the maritime station did not start until 1898, driven by non military personnel temporary workers. In mid 1899, Tilley was doled out the undertaking of regulating the station development and turning into its first commandant. He was additionally placed in direction of the collier ship to transport steel and coal to the building site and to fill in as the primary station deliver. After a long voyage, he took his new post on August 13, 1899. 

Indeed, even before Tilley touched base in Samoa, the political circumstance there was moving. The Second Samoan Civil War had as of late finished, leaving the islands without a working focal government. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany had contending key and financial interests in the area. Confirmation of the Tripartite Convention on February 16, 1900 divided the Samoan archipelago. The eastern part, with Tutuila as its biggest island, was set under the control of the United States. The bigger and verifiably predominant western part was doled out to Germany. Under this settlement, the British government surrendered its cases over Samoa in return for specific concessions from Germany in the Pacific and Africa. 

In the wake of learning of the understanding, Tilley informed the nearby boss and declared ostensible United States control, however a formal choice had not yet been made on how the United States government would deal with the domain. The development of the maritime base remained his essential obligation, and he was dispatched to get extra supplies and coal at Auckland, New Zealand. President William McKinley set the region under the control of the United States Navy on February 19, 1900, and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Charles H. Allen named Tilley commandant of United States Naval Station Tutuila with a sanction to "develop well disposed relations with the locals". 

Tilley's first errand in his new job was to arrange a deed of cession with the nearby powers to guarantee a formal and serene exchange of control to the United States. With the apportioning of Samoa, two territorial governments stayed on Tutuila which had been subjected to an administration on the western, German-controlled island of Upolu. Both of these legislatures were good toward the cession. The occupants of the island of Tau and the volcanic doublet of Ofu-Olosega (together known as Manu'a) toward the east were politically isolated from Tutuila. On March 12, 1900, Tilley made a trip to Tau to meet with the neighborhood ruler Tui ManuÊ»a Elisala. Eventually, the ruler consented to surrender some sway to the United States, however would not think about full cession. The deed of cession was marked on April 17, 1900 and recorded Manu'a as a feature of the United States' new domain, however without the mark of its delegate. In it, Tilley was named Acting Governor; the domain did not have an official senator until the title was given to Governor Edmund Beardsley Underwood in 1905. Manu'a did not consent to sign the deed until 1904, subsequent to arranging concessions from the United States. 

Tilley's first demonstrations were to force an obligation on imports to the domain, boycott the clearance of liquor to the neighborhood populace (yet not Americans), and prohibit the closeout of Samoan grounds to non-Samoans. On May 1, 1900, he declared that the laws of the United States were in power in the domain, however that Samoan laws that did not struggle with U.S. law would stay as a result. He apportioned the domain into three regions, along the recorded divisions verifiably recognized in the deed of cession: the two governments on Tutuila and the third including the islands of Manu'a, which still did not see themselves as a component of the region. Throughout the following year, Tilley managed guns, implemented required enrollments of births, passings, and relational unions, collected expenses, and made the sabbath an open occasion. He made a little volunteer army of local Samoans called the Fita Guard for resistance and police. The local volunteers in this power were prepared at the maritime station by a sergeant of the United States Marine Corps. 

Issues emerged amid Tilley's organization as a result of clashing Samoan and American laws. In one case, a local had gotten and eaten a skipjack, a consecrated fish which must be eaten with the authorization of a nearby boss under Samoan law. Customary discipline announced that the guilty party's home ought to be copied down and his yields removed, and he ought to be ousted from the region. The local tested his discipline under the American legitimate framework, be that as it may, bringing about the capture of the boss in charge of requesting the pulverization of his property. The boss was condemned to a time of house capture in a criminal continuing, on which Tilley sat as judge, and he was requested to pay for the obliterated property. There were comparative issues with Samoan traditions not mixing admirably with the recently presented American political divisions in the domain. For instance, the domain's three area governors had measure up to power however they were of contrasting Samoan societal position. This divergence settled on basic leadership increasingly troublesome and caused social strains. In spite of these issues, Tilley was all around considered by local people. On December 18, 1900, the nearby boss sent a letter of congrats on the re-appointment of President McKinley in which they said of Tilley, "you gave us a pioneer, a Governor, a High Chief, whom we have figured out how to love and regard". 

Tilley disappeared in June 1901 to come back to Washington, leaving E. J. Dorn in order. Dorn accordingly had therapeutic issues and was supplanted by J. L. Jayne in October. That month, a mysterious objection was made to Assistant Secretary of the Navy Frank W. Hackett against Commandant Tilley, asserting unethical behavior and tipsiness. Simultaneously, he was elevated to skipper by President Theodore Roosevelt. Tilley came back to Samoa on November 7, 1901 with his significant other, and after two days was given a court military. The preliminary endured four days and just a single observer was required the arraignment. Eventually, he was vindicated. Regardless of this, Captain Uriel Sebree was named as commandant on November 27, 1901. Tilley and his significant other came back to the United States the next month. 

Sebree later commented of his forerunner that he had "incredible capacity, consideration, thoughtfulness and sound presence of mind". Not at all like Sebree, who was worried that he didn't have a legitimate command to administer, Tilley was not bashful about establishing enactment and being the "accepted" pioneer of the region. Despite the fact that the deed of cession perceived his position and gave him the title of Acting Governor, to the extent the United States government was concerned, he was authoritatively dependable just for the maritime station. As the principal maritime representative, Tilley laid the basis for a significant part of things to come administration of the region, which did not yet even have a formal name. The American Samoa government incorporates Tilley and the other pre-1905 station commandants in its rundown of regional governors. 

Tilley's next task came in March 1902 as a chief of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California. He stayed in this post for a long time before being doled out to on January 11, 1905. On February 23, 1907, he was made commandant of League Island Naval Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and he was elevated to raise naval commander the next day. He kicked the bucket of pneumonia not exactly a month later on March 18, 1907. 

Tilley was one of 322 people who had kicked the bucket in 1907 recorded by "The Washington Post" as "first in their different purposes for living." He was made due by one child and two girls. His child Benjamin Franklin Tilley, Jr. additionally entered the Navy and resigned with the position of lieutenant officer.
