The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) perceived the melody as a standout amongst the most performed of 2007 at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards. 

"Fundamental" was composed for Chrisette Michele. Generation group Stargate and artist lyricist Ne-Yo had composed for BeyoncÃ©'s second collection "B'Day", yet Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate said that they probably won't have gone toward the path they did on the melody. The tune did not suit BeyoncÃ©'s voice, and Ne-Yo composed the verses from a male point of view, in spite of the fact that it did not depend on his own encounters. Ne-Yo composed the melody in the nation style, considering nation vocalists Shania Twain and Faith Hill amid the sessions. At the point when Ne-Yo heard them playing the tune with a guitar, he thought it seemed like blue grass music. Be that as it may, when the drums were joined into the music, it was conveyed to a R&B vibe, and Ne-Yo considered making a R&B-nation western music melody. 

At the point when the group worked with Ne-Yo, they recorded the melody with a male vocalist. In any case, they figured a female vocalist would be increasingly appropriate, and Ne-Yo likewise suspected that it was enabling for a lady to sing it. Eriksen of Stargate said it was an A&R individual who recommended that the tune would work better when sung by a lady. Two names needed the tune. While BeyoncÃ© chipped away at material for "B'Day", she was satisfied with the demo of the "Fundamental" that was introduced to her. In any case, "Key" did not appear to fit on "B'Day", which should be "a hard-hitting club collection". Swizz Beatz, who was dealing with the collection, pronounced that BeyoncÃ© would be insane not to incorporate the melody on the record. BeyoncÃ© requested changes to the tune, including the expansion of drums, vocal courses of action, and singing in a higher register than the demo. Espen Lind and Amund BjÃ¸rklund, from the Norwegian generation group Espionage, composed the harmony structure and the guitar part. In a meeting with MTV, Ne-Yo stated, "BeyoncÃ© had some stuff that she needed to get off her chest", while intending to make a record that ladies could identify with, with regards to the topic of the collection. 

The chronicle was built by Jim Caruana and blended by Jason Goldstein at Sony Music Studios in New York City. Goldstein was employed to blend "B'Day". He stated: "This tune was extremely easy to blend. It was created by Stargate and the sounds are great and they all seemed well and good, and there was loads of space for every one of the instruments." Goldstein utilized a board equalizer for the drums' treatment. For the acoustic guitars, he utilized the simple flanger of a TC 1210 spatial expander "to improve the sound" and to give them "somewhat progressively spread". Goldstein thought "Key" sounded "somewhat old-school"; an eighth note defer reverberation was set on the melody's lead vocal at 341ms, utilizing the "Reverberation Farm" module programming. For the support vocals, Goldstein utilized "Reverberation Farm" with a quarter note delay at 682ms and Sony's "Oxford Dynamics" blower/limiter in double mono mode. 

The blower was set in Classic setting, to copy the LA-2A leveling enhancer, and the Warmth catch used to include sounds. "Oxford Dynamics" was utilized for the bass in an alternate setting. Goldstein passed the last blend through the "Oxford EQ" and "Inflator" modules. Professional Tools programming was utilized to print the aux track into a 44.1kHz/24-bit CD and after that into a 24-bit CD ace. After the sessions for "Key" finished, Hermansen said that "everybody felt they had caught something unique and that BeyoncÃ© had done the track equity", however there were still worries that urban radio probably won't play the melody as it included acoustic guitars and had all the more a pop intrigue. "Be that as it may, at that point it turned into the greatest urban record ... ever," [Hermansen] said. 

A contention emerged over the composition credits on "Fundamental". Ne-Yo told MTV: "Clearly BeyoncÃ© was at a show some place and just before the tune went ahead she stated, 'I composed this for every one of my women's and after that the tune came onÂ ...Â The tune is a co-compose. I composed the verses, I composed every one of the verses. BeyoncÃ© helped me with the songs and the harmonies and the vocal game plan and that makes it a co-compose. Which means my commitment and her commitment made that melody what it is." In 2011, Ne-Yo said that he composed the tune for himself, however felt that it would be more qualified for BeyoncÃ©. A portion of BeyoncÃ©'s fans read Ne-Yo's comment as rude towards her. Notwithstanding, he cleared up his remark later through Twitter, stating, "I said I initially composed the tune for me.Â ...Â Once I understood how the tune goes over whenever sung by a person, that is the point at which I chose to give it away." 

"Crucial" is a mid-beat anthem with pop and R&B impacts. Written in the key of B major, the beat is set in like manner time and moves at a moderate 88 beats for each moment. BeyoncÃ©'s vocal range in the melody traverses about over two octaves, from B to E. While the greater part of the melodies on the collection are forceful and uptempo, her voice on "Crucial" is conditioned down. "Imperative" utilizes a delicately strummed acoustic guitar, following the Bâ Fâ Cmâ E harmony arrangement. Hermansen and Eriksen consolidated the great harmony movement on an acoustic guitar, a cutting edge sounding 808 drum beat and cellos. Al Shipley of "Stylus Magazine" noticed that the guitar strum can be found in Rihanna's 2007 single "Detest That I Love You", a tune co-delivered by Stargate and Ne-Yo. Deny Sheffield of "Moving Stone" composed that Chris Brown's 2007 single "With You", another Stargate-created tune, likewise includes a similar component.

Jim DeRogatis of the "Chicago Sun-Times" composed that "Imperative" takes after numbers sung by Whitney Houston. Spence D. of IGN composed that the tune was motivated by Aretha Franklin's work since "Crucial" comprises of a few varieties in gutturals and octave extend. The verses of "Essential" concern the breakdown of a lady's association with her sweetheart after she finds his unfaithfulness, and the tune "sounds a ton like an announcement of freedom". Sarah Rodman of "The Boston Globe" expressed, "With an up to this time obscure handle of subtlety, Beyonce consolidates despair, bombast, and outrage as she tells a scoundrel he's a long way from vitalâand that, truth be told, her new man will arrive immediately." Hermansen said that "Key" is a melody that "individuals from varying backgrounds can appreciate". BeyoncÃ© said that the tune is "somewhat legitimate", and, "... essentially we can't overlook our capacity and our value. What's more, now and again you're so enamored, you overlook that. Furthermore, now and again you have an inclination that you're not being valued. What's more, in some cases they overlook that they can be supplanted." 

The tune's verses are developed in the section pre-tune chorale structure. It starts with guitar strumming, and BeyoncÃ© sings the snare introduction, "to one side, to one side: all that you claim in a case to one side". In bar seven, she sings the main section, contending with her beau about the lack of concern of their relationship, and guides him to leave. The pre-tune and tune pursue, "You should not know 'session meÂ ...Â I can have another you by tomorrow/I could have another you in a minuteÂ ...Â Don't you ever for a second get to deduction/You're imperative". In the second stanza, BeyoncÃ© remembers the minute she found her sweetheart's unfaithfulness. A similar example prompts the second melody. Towards the end, BeyoncÃ© sings the extension, where she reveals to her sweetheart, "Supplanting you is so natural". The melody closes with an advertisement libbed theme. "The Boston Globe" noticed that BeyoncÃ© sings a few pieces of it in a higher register "that supplements the verses' injured reasonableness".

Hermansen did not anticipate "Vital" to comply with any classification. Notwithstanding his forecast, the melody ended up fruitful on urban outlines. It was played in New York and on nation radio stations. Not long after the arrival of "Basic", BeyoncÃ© told MTV: "I adore 'Basic'. I believe it's critical to have those melodies. I've had such huge numbers of individuals come up to me in tears, saying, 'I encountered my first separation. If not for the tune, I wouldn't be sufficiently able to not call. I wouldn't know the amount I'm worth.' I'm upbeat to be a piece of that."
