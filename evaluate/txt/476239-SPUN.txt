Lukather has been assigned for twelve Grammy Awards, and has won five. While his work with Toto was overwhelmingly founded on popular shake music and his performance work wanders into dynamic shake and hard shake, a considerable lot of Lukather's side-ventures are centered around jazz combination.

Lukather plays essentially a mark electric guitar made by Ernie Ball Music Man bearing his moniker, Luke. He likewise plays Yamaha and Ovation Adamas arrangement acousticâ electric guitars. 

Steven Lee Lukather was conceived on October 21, 1957, in the San Fernando Valley, California. He initially played consoles and drums, and after that showed himself how to play the guitar beginning at age seven, when his dad got him a Kay acoustic guitar and a duplicate of the Beatles collection "Meet the Beatles". Lukather has said that the collection "transformed him" and that he was enormously impacted by the guitar playing of George Harrison specifically. 

At Grant High School, Lukather met David Paich and the Porcaro siblings (Jeff, Steve, and Mike), every one of whom in the long run progressed toward becoming individuals from Toto. Lukather, who had been a self-educated performer, started taking guitar exercises from Jimmy Wyble. With Wyble, Lukather extended his insight into more extensive parts of music, including arrangement. It was amid this period in the mid 1970s that Lukather ended up intrigued by turning into a session artist, a livelihood that gave chances to play an assortment of acclaimed performers. 

Jeff Porcaro, who had been playing drums with Steely Dan since 1973, turned into a guide to Lukather and encouraged his enthusiasm for session work. Lukather's first employment in the music business was studio work with Boz Scaggs, after which Paich and Jeff Porcaroâwho had turned out to be noticeable session performers in their very own rightâasked Lukather to go along with them in shaping Toto in 1976 alongside Bobby Kimball, David Hungate, and Steve Porcaro. 

Lukather is the first lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that limit with regards to the band's whole history, just as a lead and support vocalist and writer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as a craftsman and once as a maker. David Paich drove the band's songwriting endeavors amid the improvement of 1978's "Toto"â he wrote everything except two of the collection's tracks, including each of the four of its singles. Lukather likewise credits Jeff Porcaro for his authority inside the band amid that period. In any case, Lukather's job in Toto advanced after some time attributable to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro crumbled while doing yard work at home and accordingly kicked the bucket of heart disappointment. The demise significantly influenced Toto and Lukather specifically, who felt that he expected to venture up and ensure the band continued onward. Therefore, he started taking to a greater degree a position of authority. 

Toto experienced a few lead vocalists throughout the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 expulsion of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead artist until around 1997; Lukather accepted the greater part of the vocal obligations for the band amid that time. He performed lead vocals for each track on 1992's "Kingdom of Desire" and 1995's "Tambu" with the exception of two instrumental tracks. The "Tambu" single "I Will Remember", co-composed by Lukather and Stan Lynch, achieved number 64 on UK graphs. Some "Tambu" commentators stood out Lukather's vocals from those of previous artists Kimball and Williams (and without a doubt, intensely scrutinized the whole collection), some show analysts noticed that he battled vocally on specific tunes, and various reinforcement artists and visitor vocalists went with the band's live shows amid that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to team up on 1998's "Toto XX" that Lukather returned dominatingly to the job of reinforcement vocalist. 

Lukather's songwriting commitments developed from a sprinkling of tracks on early Toto collections to co-composing pretty much every track beginning in the late 1980s.

He composed not very many of Toto's tunes without anyone else, a special case being the hit single "I Won't Hold You Back" from "Toto IV".

Lukather's authentic site claims he added to composing the majority of the melodies on Toto's 2006 collection "Falling in Between", despite the fact that "Otherworldly Man" authoritatively acknowledges Paich as the sole essayist. 

By 2008, Lukather was the main staying, unique Toto part as yet performing with the band: Bobby Kimball was additionally in the band at the time, however prior had been missing from it for quite a while â though Lukather has been with Toto since its arrangement. Be that as it may, in June of that year, Lukather chose to leave Toto. This choice legitimately prompted the official disintegration of the band.

The 1989 collection "Lukather" came to fruition after Toto had been recording and playing for 11Â years, and the agreement among the band individuals was to enjoy a reprieve. As Lukather had composed various tunes that did not show up on Toto collections, he chose to seek after a performance collection, with the aim of displaying an element of his music that fans would be new to. He worked together with numerous striking performers, including Eddie Van Halen, Richard Marx, Jan Hammer, Steve Stevens, and individual Toto individuals Jeff Porcaro and David Paich.

Toto familiars Simon Phillips and David Paich partook just as David Garfield, John PeÃ±a, Chris Trujillo, Lenny Castro, Larry Klimas, Fee Waybill, Richard Page, and Paul Rodgers. Lukather recorded the collection in for the most part live takes with small overdubbing.

The melody "Re-appropriated Time" was discharged as a solitary in Europe and included "Red House" as a B-side. 

Lukather depicts 1997's "Luke" as a vastly different and the sky is the limit from there "thoughtful" collection than his past two solo endeavors. The collection is a concentrated accumulation of a considerable lot of Lukather's melodic impacts, and he purposely let those impacts turn out on the collection. "Luke" is a test collection, and like "Candyman" it was recorded generally in live sessions with negligible overdubbing and handling a while later.

The task was a test to Lukather, who must be imaginative to transform the generally basic tunes into something fascinating for audience members without adjusting the central structures. He said of the collection, "Yet I never imagined in a million years that I'd complete a Christmas record." 

The artists Lukather decided for "Santamental", the vast majority of whom were engaged with the hard-shake sort, loaned a substantial vibe to the collection. Van Halen recorded guitar tracks for "Happiness to the World" after not having been in the studio for quite a while yet quickly established a connection on Lukather with his dimension of playing. Vai gave guitar work to "Hymn of the Bells" alongside Lukather's child Trevor, at that point 14 years of age.
