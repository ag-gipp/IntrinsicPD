On 5Â January 1939, Brill enrolled in the 21st Light Horse Regiment, a Militia unit, at Narrandera. He was elevated to corporal in May. The earlier month he had been tried as a potential air cadet, the meeting board discovering him a "tranquil nation chap" who was "fairly moderate" yet "insightful". 

On 11 November 1940, Brill exchanged to the RAAF dynamic save, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF). He experienced the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), experiencing starting guidance at RAAF Bradfield Park in Sydney. Chosen to be a pilot, he got his rudimentary flying preparing on De Havilland Tiger Moths at RAAF Station Narrandera. In March 1941, Brill was presented on Canada for cutting edge guidance on Avro Ansons at No.Â 3 Service Flying Training School, Calgary. He was appointed as a pilot officer on 28Â July 1941, and cruised to Britain the following month. In October he started changing over to Vickers Wellington medium planes at No.Â 27 Operational Training Unit, Lichfield, and was allocated to No.Â 460 Squadron RAAF, which framed at RAF Molesworth the next month. 

Raised under the Article XV arrangements of EATS, No.Â 460 Squadron was one of a few ostensibly Australian developments participating in RAF Bomber Command's vital air crusade against Germany. In January 1942, the unit moved from Molesworth to RAF Breighton, Yorkshire. Brill flew as a co-pilot in No.Â 460 Squadron's first activity, against the German port of Emden in March. He was soon in direction of his own Wellington, assaulting focuses in northern France. On 5Â April 1942, he embraced his first fight against an all around protected city somewhere down in adversary region, Cologne. He later recorded his dread before the strike: 

The evening of 29/30 May 1942, Brill's was one of 27 air ship definite to bomb the Gnome et RhÃ´ne, Thomson Houston, and Goodrich production lines in the Paris suburb of Gennevilliers. The teams were required to have great perceivability of the objective zone before besieging, to guarantee precision and decrease regular citizen losses. Because of foul climate over the Channel, Brill flew at an elevation of not exactly until intersection the French coast. The mists had started to clear over Paris and searchlights cleared the sky, joined by overwhelming enemy of flying machine fire. A large portion of the aircraft discharged their heaps from between , however Brill dropped to before making his assault. With the cargo openings open, his Wellington was struck by fire, harming the power through pressure and back firearm turret, and abandoning one of the bombs hanging after the others dropped on target. Coming back to England through increasingly awful climate, he detected a crisis arrival ground and carried the injured Wellington down with the bomb entryways still open and one tire level; the plane was later rejected. Brill's was the just a single of four Wellingtons from No.Â 460 Squadron to discover the objective territory and effectively assault. For his "awe inspiring strength and assurance" in squeezing home the strike, he was granted the Distinguished Flying Cross on 26Â June, the main pilot in his squadron to be finished. 

No.Â 460 Squadron took part in 1,000-aircraft strikes against Cologne, Essen and Bremen in May and June 1942. Brill was elevated to acting flight lieutenant in July, and finished his first voyage through activities, numbering 31 forays, on 11Â August. He was backed to the RAF as a teacher in November 1942, coming back to No.Â 27 Operational Training Unit at Lichfield. He went through the following eleven months there, driving a preparation flight and picking up advancement to acting squadron pioneer in April 1943. In August, he was best man at the wedding of his companion and individual RAAF pilot, Arthur Doubleday. The press would come to allude to the pair as the "Flying Twins", as their wartime professions intently paralleled each otherâthe two men originated from the Riverina locale, consolidated the Air Force on Remembrance Day 1940, landed in England in August 1941, flew Wellingtons in No.Â 460 Squadron, volunteered for second visits in Bomber Command, and got numerous improvements and advancements couple. Doubleday would proceed to endure the war and become dynamic in common avionics. 

Having volunteered for his second visit, Brill experienced transformation to Handley Page Halifax and Avro Lancaster overwhelming planes in the most recent long stretches of 1943. In the new year, he was designated a flight officer in No.Â 463 Squadron RAAF, working Lancasters out of RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire. Waddington was likewise home to another Australian squadron, No.Â 467, and Brill took a functioning part in the station's boisterous chaos life. His more youthful sibling Vic, who had joined the RAAF in 1941, was in a similar squadron. Brill came back to battle amidst the Battle of Berlin, flying his first foray to the "Enormous City" on 20Â January 1944. The factual probability of enduring an operational voyage through 30 missions in Bomber Command was never over half, however misfortune rates amid the Battle of Berlin were far higher. 

Brill took off for his second mission to Berlin on 27Â January. The Lancaster he flew was said to be cursed, had of a motor that lost power noticeable all around yet constantly tried well on the ground, and enduring oxygen disappointment that murdered its back heavy weapons specialist on the past fight. One of the motors began to vacillate before Brill achieved Berlin, constraining him to fly lower than typical. Having discharged his bombs over target, he felt the plane take a few strikes that he accepted were hostile to air ship fire, however were in truth the flammables of a Lancaster hovering above. His air ship's nose, rudder controls, and electricals were all seriously harmed, and the port wing was ablaze. Having cautioned his group to plan to rescue, Brill jumped the Lancaster and prevailing with regards to putting out the blazes. The team had the capacity to stay ready and, following a nine-hour flight, the plane arrived back at Waddington. Brill's decision on the mission was, as he later stated, "not my concept of a night's excitement".

By April 1944, No.Â 463 Squadron had started to focus on focuses in France and Belgium as the Allied air battle moved concentration from vital shelling to decimating landing strips and disturbing lines of correspondence preceding the attack of the landmass. On 8Â May, Brill was the besieging controller for an attack on a landing strip close Brest. The controller was required to land in front of the primary Allied power, watch that flares denoting the objective were set up, and caution his colleagues on the off chance that they were bombarding mistakenly. When Brill had finished this undertaking and gone in himself to assault, the ground protections were completely alert and peppered his Lancaster with 140 slug gaps, however he wouldn't make hesitant move until he had conveyed his bombload. Elevated to acting wing administrator, Brill expected control of No.Â 467 Squadron on 12Â May, after the demise in battle of its past leader, Group Captain John Balmer.

He was granted the Distinguished Service Order on 19Â May for "authority, ability and valor of the most noteworthy request" and "his assurance to make each foray a triumph" disregarding incessant harm to his airplane.

Brill's Lancaster was assaulted by three German night contenders, however he had the capacity to sidestep them with just a couple of projectiles striking his plane. His "fine administration and strength" amid the activity earned him a bar to his DFC; the honor was declared in "The London Gazette" on 16Â January 1945. Brill finished his second voyage through activities later in July yet remained on to fly more missions, frequently tutoring less experienced teams. At this point he had earned a notoriety for being very "distraught", as he would regularly hover back and look at over his craftsmanship after a shelling run, instead of making his getaway from the objective territory as fast as could be allowed. Amid non-operational periods, he made a propensity for taking a Lancaster on an alleged dry run toward the southern outskirt of Northern Ireland, where he and his group would change into non military personnel garments, cross into Ireland and stock up on sustenance and alcohol for a gathering back at Waddington; he constantly tried welcoming the Air Officer Commanding RAAF Overseas Headquarters, Air Vice Marshal Henry Wrigley, to such occasions, which Wrigley went to as a general rule. Brill gave over order of No.Â 467 Squadron on 12Â October 1944, turning into the primary man to endure his time as its pioneer. He had flown a sum of 58 missions in Bomber Command when he came back to Australia in the new year. On 29Â January 1945 he wedded Ilma Kitto, an instructor, at Ganmain's Methodist Church. The couple had been locked in since before the war; they later had two children and a little girl. 

Brill stayed in the Air Force following the finish of threats. From February 1946 to August 1947 he filled in as the solitary boss of the RAAF's recently shaped and soon-disbanded Heavy Bomber Crew Conversion Unit at RAAF Station East Sale, Victoria. Little help or course on its utilization as a preparation office was prospective from higher order, and in the late spring months its Avro Lincoln planes were utilized in bushfire watches over East Gippsland, detailing 44 flare-ups in February 1947 alone. Brill exchanged from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force in 1948, and returned to the position of squadron pioneer. In March 1949 he turned into the debut boss of a re-shaped No.Â 10 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron, which had been disbanded in 1945 after administration all through World WarÂ II. In its new pretense the squadron was built up from the staff and offices of RAAF Station Garbutt in Townsville. Brill's fundamental undertakings were sorting out to assimilate or close surplus wartime offices in North Queensland, and getting ready No.Â 10 Squadron for pursuit and-salvage activities. The unit took conveyance of its initial four Lincoln Mk 30s in September 1949, and Brill gave over order the next January. 

Raised to substantive wing leader, Brill filled in as an executive at RAAF Staff College in Point Cook, Victoria, until his arrangement as Staff Officer to the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sir Donald Hardman, in March 1952.
