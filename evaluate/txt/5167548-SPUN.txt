It was unimaginable the measure of vitality he had". Preparing for the race track by and large starts when a pony is a long yearlingâamong one and a half and two years old. Simple Jet was so natural to prepare that Merrick chose to manage the preparation himself instead of send the pony away to an expert coach. In a training race at the farm, Merrick coordinated the yearling against Jet Smooth. In spite of the fact that his senior sibling had the benefit of past race understanding, Easy Jet won the 350-yard (320Â m) race.
