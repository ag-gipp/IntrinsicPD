Galerina marginata 

Galerina marginata is a types of toxic growth in the family Hymenogastraceae of the request Agaricales. Preceding 2001, the species G.Â autumnalis, G.Â oregonensis, G.Â unicolor, and G.Â venenata were believed to be isolated because of contrasts in territory and the viscidity of their tops, however phylogenetic investigation demonstrated that they are all similar species. 

The organic product assemblages of this growth have dark colored to yellow-darker tops that blur in shading while drying. The gills are tanish and give a corroded spore print. A very much characterized membranous ring is regularly observed on the stems of youthful examples yet frequently vanishes with age. In more established organic product bodies, the tops are compliment and the gills and stems browner. The species is a great "minimal darker mushroom"â a catchall classification that incorporates all little to medium-sized, hard-to-recognize tanish mushrooms, and might be effectively mistaken for a few consumable animal varieties. 

"Galerina marginata" is far reaching in the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia, and has likewise been found in Australia. It is a wood-spoiling growth that develops transcendently on rotting conifer wood. A very noxious species, it contains the equivalent destructive amatoxins found in the passing top ("Amanita phalloides"). Ingestion in lethal sums causes extreme liver harm with spewing, loose bowels, hypothermia, and possible demise if not treated quickly. Around ten poisonings have been credited to the species presently gathered as "G.Â marginata" in the course of the only remaining century. 

What is currently perceived as a solitary morphologically factor taxon named "Galerina marginata" was once part into five unmistakable species. Norwegian mycologist Gro Gulden and associates inferred that every one of the five spoke to similar species in the wake of contrasting the DNA arrangements of the inner deciphered spacer locale of ribosomal DNA for different North American and European examples in "Galerina" area "Naucoriopsis". The outcomes demonstrated no hereditary contrasts among "G.Â marginata" and "G.Â autumnalis", "G.Â oregonensis", "G.Â unicolor", and "G.Â venenata", therefore decreasing every one of these names to synonymy. The most established of these names are "Agaricus marginatus", depicted by August Batsch in 1789, and "Agaricus unicolor", portrayed by Martin Vahl in 1792. "Agaricus autumnalis" was depicted by Charles Horton Peck in 1873, and later moved to "Galerina" by A.Â H.Â Smith and Rolf Singer in their 1962 overall monograph on that family. In a similar distribution they additionally presented the "G.Â autumnalis" assortments "robusta" and "angusticystis". One more of the synonymous species, "G.Â oregonensis", was first portrayed in that monograph. "Galerina venenata" was first distinguished as an animal types by Smith in 1953. Since "Agaricus marginatus" is the most seasoned truly distributed name, it has need as indicated by the guidelines of herbal classification. 

Another species broke down in Gulden's 2001 examination, "Galerina pseudomycenopsis", additionally couldn't be recognized from "G.Â marginata" in light of ribosomal DNA groupings and limitation part length polymorphism investigations. As a result of contrasts in biology, organic product body shading and spore estimate joined with deficient examining, the creators liked to look after "G.Â pseudomycenopsis" as an unmistakable species. A recent report again neglected to isolate the two species utilizing sub-atomic strategies, yet announced that the contrariness exhibited in mating tests recommends that the species are unmistakable. 

In the fourth release (1986) of Singer's complete characterization of the Agaricales, "G.Â marginata" is the sort types of "Galerina" segment "Naucoriopsis", a subdivision previously characterized by French mycologist Robert KÃ¼hner in 1935. It incorporates little dark colored spored mushrooms portrayed by top edges at first bended inwards, natural product bodies looking like "Pholiota" or "Naucoria" and flimsy walled, coldhearted or intense finished pleurocystidia that are not adjusted at the top. Inside this segment, "G.Â autumnalis" and "G.Â oregonensis" are in stirps "Autumnalis", while "G.Â unicolor", "G.Â marginata", and "G.Â venenata" are in stirps "Marginata". "Autumnalis" species are described by having a viscid to lubricous top surface while "Marginata" species come up short on a coagulated topâthe surface is damp, "greasy sparkling", or matte when wet. Be that as it may, as Gulden clarifies, this trademark is exceedingly factor: "Viscidity is a famously troublesome character to evaluate on the grounds that it changes with the age of the fruitbody and the climate conditions amid its improvement. Fluctuating degrees of viscidity will in general be portrayed distinctively and connected conflictingly by various people applying terms, for example, lubricous, greasy, greasy gleaming, sticky, viscid, glutinous, or (to some degree) disgusting." 

The particular designation "marginata" is gotten from the Latin word for "edge" or "edge", while "autumnalis" signifies "of the harvest time". Normal names of the species incorporate the "marginate Pholiota" (coming about because of its synonymy with "Pholiota marginata"), "burial service chime", "dangerous skullcap", and "lethal Galerina". "G.Â autumnalis" was known as the "fall Galerina" or the "harvest time Galerina", while "G.Â venenata" was the "dangerous yard Galerina". 

The top reaches in width. It begins arched, once in a while comprehensively funnel shaped, and has (edges) that are bended in against the gills. As the top develops and extends, it turns out to be comprehensively raised and after that leveled, now and again building up a focal rise, or umbo, which may extend conspicuously from the top surface. 

In view of the aggregate portrayals of the five taxa now viewed as "G.Â marginata", the surface of the surface shows noteworthy variety. Smith and Singer give the accompanying depictions of surface: from "viscid" ("G.Â autumnalis"), to "sparkling and viscid to lubricous when sodden" ("G.Â oregonensis"), to "sparkling, lubricous to subviscid (particles of soil cling to surface) or just damp, with a greasy appearance in spite of the fact that not unmistakably viscid", to "soggy however not viscid" ("G.Â marginata"). The top surface stays smooth and changes hues with mugginess (hygrophanous), pale to dim ochraceous brownish over the circle and yellow-ochraceous on the edge (at any rate when youthful), yet blurring to dull tan or darker when dry. Whenever soggy, the top is to some degree straightforward so the frameworks of the gills might be viewed as striations. The substance is pale tanish ochraceous to about white, flimsy and malleable, with a scent and taste differing from in all respects marginally to unequivocally like flour (farinaceous). 

The gills are normally thin and gathered together, with an extensively adnate to almost decurrent connection to the stem and arched edges. They are a colorless darker when youthful, getting to be brownish at development. Some short gills, called lamellulae, don't expand altogether from the top edge to the stem, and are intercalated among the more drawn out gills. The stem ranges from long, thick at the summit, and remains break even with in width all through or is marginally augmented descending. At first strong, it ends up empty from the base up as it develops. The membranous ring is situated on the upper portion of the stem close to the top, however might be sloughed off and missing in more established examples. Its shading is at first whitish or light dark colored, however normally shows up a darker corroded darker in develop examples that have dropped spores on it. Over the dimension of the ring, the stem surface has a fine whitish powder and is paler than the top; beneath the ring it is darker down to the rosy darker to bistre base. The lower bit of the stem has a meager covering of pale fibrils which in the long run vanish and don't leave any scales. The spore print is corroded dark colored. 

The spores measure 8â 10 by 5â 6Â Âµm, and are somewhat inequilateral in profile view, and egg-molded in face see. Like all "Galerina" species, the spores have a plage, which has been depicted as taking after "a somewhat wrinkled plastic therapist fold covering around the distal end of the spore". The spore surface is warty and loaded with wrinkles, with a smooth gloom where the spore was once joined by means of the sterigmatum to the basidium (the spore-bearing cell). At the point when in potassium hydroxide (KOH) arrangement, the spores seem brownish or darker corroded dark colored, with an apical callus. The basidia are four-spored (seldom with a not many two-spored ones), generally tube shaped while creating spores, however with a somewhat decreased base, and measure 21â 29 by 5â 8.4Â Âµm. 

Cystidia are cells of the prolific hymenium that don't deliver spores. These sterile cells, which are fundamentally unmistakable from the basidia, are additionally characterized by their position. In "G.Â marginata", the pleurocystidia (cystidia from the gill sides) are 46â 60 by 9â 12Â Âµm, flimsy walled, and hyaline in KOH, fusoid to ventricose fit as a fiddle with wavy necks and obtuse to subacute apices (3â 6Â Âµm measurement close zenith). The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges) are comparable fit as a fiddle however regularly littler than the pleurocystidia, inexhaustible, with no club-formed or suddenly decreasing (mucronate) cells present. Brace associations are available in the hyphae. 

"Galerina marginata" might be confused with a couple of consumable mushroom species. "Pholiota mutabilis" (Kuehneromyces mutabilis) produces natural product bodies generally comparable in appearance and furthermore develops on wood, however might be recognized from "G.Â marginata" by its stems bearing scales up to the dimension of the ring, and from developing in expansive bunches (which isn't common of "G.Â marginata"). In any case, the likelihood of disarray is to such an extent that this great eatable species is "not prescribed to those lacking impressive involvement in the recognizable proof of higher growths." Furthermore, tiny examination demonstrates smooth spores in "Pholiota". "G.Â marginata" might be effectively mistaken for different edibles, for example, "Armillaria mellea" and "Kuehneromyces mutabilis". As to last species, one source notes "Frequently, "G.Â marginata" looks to some extent like this growth, and it requires cautious and intense forces of perception to recognize the harmful one from the consumable one." "K.Â mutabilis" might be recognized by the nearness of scales on the stem underneath the ring, the bigger top, which may achieve a distance across of , and fiery or fragrant smell of the tissue. The related "K.Â vernalis" is an uncommon species and much progressively comparable in appearance to "G.Â marginata". Examination of infinitesimal attributes is regularly required to dependably recognize the two, uncovering smooth spores with a germ pore. 

Another potential consumable carbon copy is the "velvet foot", "Flammulina velutipes". This species has gills that are white to light yellow, a white spore print, and spores that are curved, smooth, and measure 6.5â 9 by 2.5â 4Â Âµm. An unpleasant likeness has additionally been noted with the eatable "Hypholoma capnoides", the 'enchantment' mushroom Psilocybe subaeruginosa just as "Conocybe filaris", another toxic amatoxin-containing species. 

"Galerina marginata" is a saprobic parasite, getting supplements by separating natural issue. It is known to have the greater part of the significant classes of discharged proteins that disintegrate plant cell divider polysaccharides, and has been utilized as a model saprobe in ongoing investigations of ectomycorrhizal growths. On account of its assortment of chemicals equipped for separating wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is as of now sequencing its genome. The organism is commonly answered to develop on or close to the wood of conifers, in spite of the fact that it has been seen to develop on hardwoods also. Organic product bodies may develop singularly, however more regularly in gatherings or little groups, and show up in the mid year to pre-winter. Here and there, they may develop on covered wood and in this manner have all the earmarks of being developing on soil. 

"Galerina marginata" is broadly disseminated all through the Northern Hemisphere, found in North America, Europe, Japan, Iran, mainland Asia, and the Caucasus. In North America, it has been gathered as far north as the boreal backwoods of Canada and subarctic and ice natural surroundings in Labrador, and south to Jalisco, Mexico. It is likewise found in Australia. 

The poisons found in "Galerina marginata" are known as amatoxins. Amatoxins have a place with a group of bicyclic octapeptide subordinates made out of an amino corrosive ring connected by a sulfur iota and described by contrasts in their side gatherings; these mixes are in charge of over 90% of deadly mushroom poisonings in people. The amatoxins repress the protein RNA polymerase II, which duplicates the hereditary code of DNA into ambassador RNA particles. The poison normally aggregates in liver cells, and the following disturbance of digestion represents the serious liver brokenness cause by amatoxins. Amatoxins additionally lead to kidney disappointment on the grounds that, as the kidneys endeavor to sift through toxic substance, it harms the tangled tubules and reenters the blood to recycle and cause more harm. Introductory indications after ingestion incorporate extreme stomach torment, heaving, and looseness of the bowels which may keep going for six to nine hours. Past these side effects, poisons seriously influence the liver which results in gastrointestinal dying, a state of extreme lethargy, kidney disappointment, or even passing, as a rule inside seven days of utilization. 

"Galerina marginata" was appeared different examinations to contain the amatoxins Î±-amanitin and Î³-amanitin, first as "G.Â venenata", at that point as "G.Â marginata" and "G.Â autumnalis". The capacity of the parasite to deliver these poisons was affirmed by developing the mycelium as a fluid culture (just follow measures of Î²-amanitin were found). "G.Â marginata" is believed to be the main types of the amatoxin-creating genera that will deliver the poisons while developing in culture. Both amanitins were measured in "G.Â autumnalis" (1.5Â mg/g dry weight) and "G.Â marginata" (1.1Â mg/g dry weight). Later investigations affirmed the event of Î³-amanitin and Î²-amanitin in German examples of "G.Â autumnalis" and "G.Â marginata" and uncovered the nearness of the three amanitins in the natural product groups of "G.Â unicolor". Albeit some mushroom field guides guarantee that the species (as "G.Â autumnalis") additionally contains phallotoxins (anyway phallotoxins can't be consumed by people), logical proof does not bolster this conflict. A recent report established that the amatoxin substance of "G.Â marginata" changed from 78.17 to 243.61Â Âµg/g of new weight. In this investigation, the amanitin sums from certain "Galerina" examples were higher than those from some "Amanita phalloides", an European organism for the most part considered as the most extravagant in amanitins. The creators propose that "different parameters, for example, outward factors (natural conditions) and inherent elements (hereditary properties) could add to the huge difference in amatoxin substance from various examples." The deadly portion of amatoxins has been evaluated to be about 0.1Â mg/kg human body weight, or even lower. In view of this esteem, the ingestion of 10 "G.Â marginata" organic product bodies containing about 250Â Âµg of amanitins per gram of new tissue could harm a youngster weighing roughly . Notwithstanding, a 20-year review investigation of in excess of 2100 instances of amatoxin poisonings from North American and Europe demonstrated that few cases were because of ingestion of "Galerina" species. This low recurrence might be ascribed to the mushroom's unexceptional appearance as a "little darker mushroom" prompting it being neglected by authorities, and by the way that 21% of amatoxin poisonings were brought about by unidentified species. 

The poisonous quality of certain "Galerina" species has been known for a century. In 1912, Charles Horton Peck revealed a human harming case due to "G.Â autumnalis". In 1954, a harming was brought about by "G.Â venenata". Somewhere in the range of 1978 and 1995, ten cases brought about by amatoxin-containing Galerinas were accounted for in the writing. Three European cases, two from Finland and one from France were ascribed to "G.Â marginata" and "G.Â unicolor", individually. Seven North American exposures included two fatalities from Washington due to "G.Â venenata", with five cases responding decidedly to treatment; four poisonings were brought about by "G.Â autumnalis" from Michigan and Kansas, notwithstanding harming brought about by a unidentified "Galerina" species from Ohio. A few poisonings have been credited to gatherers devouring the mushrooms in the wake of confusing them with the psychedelic Psilocybe stuntzii.
