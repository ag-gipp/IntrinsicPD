His more youthful sibling Harry additionally joined the Army, and was executed in 1942. 

After the war, Saunders was retired and came back to non military personnel life. He later filled in as an organization administrator with the third Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) amid the Korean War, where he battled at the Battle of Kapyong.

In 1971, he was selected a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his locale administration. He kicked the bucket in 1990, matured 69. 

Saunders was brought into the world close Purnim on the Framlingham Aboriginal Reserve in western Victoria on 7 August 1920. He was an individual from the Gunditjmara individuals. His dad, Chris, was a veteran of the First World War, having filled in as a heavy armament specialist in the Australian Imperial Force. One of his uncles, William Reginald Rawlings, who was executed in real life and after whom Saunders was named, had been granted the Military Medal for administration with the 29th Battalion in France. Another predecessor, John Brook, battled with the Victorian Rifles and the Australian Commonwealth Horse in the Boer War. Saunders' mom passed on in 1924 from intricacies brought about by pneumonia while bringing forth her third kid, a young lady who additionally kicked the bucket. After this, his dad moved to Lake Condah in Victoria, with Reg and his more youthful sibling, Harry, conceived in 1922. As their dad attempted different working occupations, the two young men were raised to a great extent by their grandma. 

Saunders went to the nearby mission school at Lake Condah, where he did well in maths, geometry and dialects. His dad, in the interim, instructed Reg and Harry about the hedge, and urged them to peruse Shakespeare and Australian writing. In the wake of finishing eight years of tutoring, Saunders earned his legitimacy authentication. His formal training in this way finished, he got down to business at 14 years old as a millhand in a sawmill. Managers consistently retained installments for Aboriginal workers as of now, yet Saunders wouldn't work except if he was paid his full privilege, and his boss yielded. He worked and promoted his instruction until 1937, when he started a new business with his dad and sibling, working a sawmill in Portland, Victoria; the sawmill was demolished in a bushfire in 1939. 

Following the flare-up of the Second World War, Saunders was resolved to serve in the military. Nationalism and his family ancestry's of soldiering both had a noteworthy influence in his choice. His dad recommended that he hold up a half year; as per Reg, "They were discussing this war being all over in a half year with the Maginot Line and the various trash that we were toldÂ ... In any case, we held up a half year and the duck season was finished so there was no all the more shooting to do with the exception of do battle". Saunders enrolled in the Second Australian Imperial Force on 24Â April 1940, collaborating with companions he had made while playing Australian guidelines football. The military later embraced an arrangement to acknowledge just people "generously of European starting point or plunge", however at the time Saunders experienced no boundaries to his selection. He reviewed that his individual fighters "were not shading cognizant", and that amid preparing in northern Queensland his white mates would sit close by him in the "Native" segment of cinemas. His regular authority characteristics picked up him impermanent advancements one after another: inside about a month and a half of enrollment he was a spear corporal, and following three months he made sergeant. 

In the wake of finishing his preparation, Saunders was allotted to an infantry unit, the 2/seventh Battalion, which was serving abroad in North Africa at the time. After achieving the 2/seventh, Saunders returned to the position of private. His first experience of war came battling the Italians around Benghazi. Toward the beginning of April 1941, the sixth Division, to which the 2/seventh had a place, was sent to Greece to help protect against a German intrusion. Following a progression of withdrawals, the unit was cleared on 26Â April, setting out upon the "Costa Rica" at Kalamata. It was initially destined for Alexandria, however after the ship was assaulted in Suda Bay by German airplane and started to sink, the men of the 2/seventh, including Saunders, were grabbed by a few British destroyers and landed on the island of Crete. The 2/seventh was along these lines dispensed to the island's shielding army. 

Following the attack of Crete in May 1941, the 2/seventh Battalion was at first utilized in a seaside safeguard job, before participating in the battling around Canea. After this, it partook in a staggering pike charge at 42nd Street, alongside the New Zealand Maori Battalion, which murdered very nearly 300 Germans and quickly checked their development. It was amid this fight Saunders executed his first rival: "...Â I saw a German trooper stand up in clear view around thirty yards [30Â m] away. He was my first beyond any doubt killÂ ... I can recall for a minute that it was much the same as shooting a kangarooÂ ... similarly as remote." As the Allies started to clear the island, the 2/seventh was gotten upon to complete a progression of rearguard activities so as to enable different units to be removed the island. After the last Allied boats withdrew the island on 1Â June 1941, the unit was abandoned. Therefore, a considerable lot of its men were taken prisoner, however some had the capacity to sidestep catch by hanging out in the slopes and gives in around the island. Receiving Cretan dress, learning the tongue, and enrolling the assistance of nearby occupants, Saunders figured out how to stay covered up for eleven months. 

Saunders was among a gathering of men cleared from Crete by a British submarine in May 1942, and came back to Australia in October. He rejoined his old unit, the 2/seventh Battalion, which had re-framed in Palestine and been taken back to Australia alongside the remainder of the sixth Division to help guard against the danger presented by Japan's entrance into the war. In November 1942, Saunders' more youthful sibling Harry, who had enrolled soon after him in 1940, was executed in real life while serving in New Guinea with the 2/fourteenth Battalion. At the point when Harry had signed up, Reg reviewed, "I was furious on the grounds that I was the special case that should go.Â ... with two of us there, one of us would get killedÂ ..." The senior Saunders in this manner served in New Guinea too, battling in the Salamauaâ Lae crusade in mid-1943 where, having again been advanced brief sergeant, he took over order of a detachment when its authority was injured in real life. For his administration, he was suggested for a commission by his leader, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Guinn. At the point when Guinn let him know of his arrangement, Saunders snickered and stated, "I would prefer not to be an officerÂ ... I'd preferably be Regimental Sergeant Major". Guinn reacted, "Christ, they don't make young men RSMs". 

Saunders went before an officer determination block that had been determined to the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, where the units of the sixth Division had been based after their arrival from New Guinea. The meeting board on the board comprised of three senior officersÂ â all accomplished infantry contingent commandersÂ â who were entrusted with deciding a competitor's appropriateness for appointing as an infantry officer. Saunders was observed to be a satisfactory applicant and presented on an officer preparing unit in Seymour, Victoria. Endless supply of the 16-week course, he was elevated to lieutenant in November 1944, turning into the principal Aboriginal charged officer in the Australian Army. The point of reference of his authorizing had caused the Army some worry because of its "uncommon centrality", and therefore the administrative work for its affirmation was in the end sent to the Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Thomas Blamey, for endorsement. All things considered, Blamey is accounted for to have "demanded following the typical methodology", trusting that there ought to be no distinction in the manner in which Saunders' bonus ought to be blessed to receive whatever other warrior who had finished the important preparing. The story earned much press inclusion in Australia, the majority of it good, if in parts paternalistic. 

After his advancement was affirmed, Saunders came back to New Guinea and, in spite of the fact that it was in opposition to arrangement, rejoined his old legion. He along these lines partook in the Aitapeâ Wewak crusade, ordering a detachment until the finish of the war. Because of the oppressive laws in power at the time, Saunders had less rights as a resident than the white Australians he drove. He was injured in the knee by Japanese gunfire amid battling around Maprik, and was hospitalized for three weeks therefore. 

Saunders was released from the Army on 5Â October 1945, after the second's end World War. Coming back to Australia, he volunteered for administration in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, however the legislature would not acknowledge Aborigines for the activity.

Saunders moved to Melbourne with his family, which at this point comprised of his better half Dorothy, whom he had hitched in 1944, and their three youthful youngsters. Dorothy had served in the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force amid the war. Saunders reviewed that he "experienced serious difficulties after the warÂ ... what's more, poor old Dotty, she, you know, didn't have the foggiest idea what the heck to make of it". Confronting segregation that he had once in a while experienced as a warrior, he worked in the resulting a very long time as a cable car conductor, a foundry laborer, and a transportation agent. 

In August 1950, the administration called for Second World War veterans to serve in the Korea War as a major aspect of the exceptionally raised 'K' Force. Saunders volunteered and came back to the Army as a lieutenant. In the wake of preparing at Puckapunyal, Victoria, and in Japan, he touched base in Korea in November 1950.

In February 1951, he assumed responsibility for AÂ Company when its authority was injured; he was along these lines given direction of CÂ Company. Elevated to skipper, Saunders drove CÂ Company amid the Battle of Kapyong in April, when 3Â RAR and a Canadian unit held off a Chinese division north-east of the South Korean capital Seoul. Baffled by the direct of the war before Kapyong, he thereafter recorded that, "Finally I felt like an Anzac and I envision there were 600 others like me". The third Battalion was granted a US Presidential Unit Citation as far as it matters for its in the activity. Saunders himself was prescribed for an enrichment however turned it down. Driving a Vickers assault rifle unit at the Battle of Maryang San in October, he apparently imparted the accompanying trade to an individual 3Â RAR officer: as they overviewed the precluding mountain before them, Saunders' buddy commented, "No nation for white men", to which Saunders answered, "It's no nation for dark men, either". He came back to Australia in November 1951. 

In 1953 the Returned and Services League (RSL), a veterans association, prescribed Saunders for incorporation in the official Australian unforeseen to the royal celebration of Elizabeth II; the Federal government dismissed the proposal in light of the fact that including Saunders would have implied barring an officer who had been recently chosen. Following his administration in the Korean War, Saunders stayed in the Army supervising preparing for national servicemen at Puckapunyal. Far from dynamic administration, be that as it may, he before long ended up disappointed and in 1954 was released at his very own solicitation. That year, he wedded an Irish medical attendant, Pat Montgomery; his first marriage had separated not long after he came back from Korea. 

Saunders got down to business in the logging business in Gippsland, after which he moved to Sydney, where he was utilized by the Austral Bronze Company.

He was additionally associated with the RSL, however he dropped out with pioneers Alf Garland and Bruce Ruxton over Garland's recommendation that Aborigines be blood-tried to decide their privilege to government benefits. "They can take all the blood they need from me," Saunders announced in a 1986 meeting, "and they'll never discover what I amÂ â in particular an AborigineÂ â ridiculous inept!" 

Amid his two relational unions, the two of which finished in separation, Saunders fathered ten youngsters, two of whom predeceased him.
