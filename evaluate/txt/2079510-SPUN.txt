SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes 

The SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes, all things considered referred to as Light Pacifics or casually as "Spam Cans", are air-smoothed 4-6-2 "Pacific" steam trains intended for the Southern Railway by its Chief Mechanical Engineer Oliver Bulleid. Consolidating various new advancements in British steam train innovation, they were among the main British plans to utilize welding in the development procedure, and to utilize steel fireboxes, which implied that parts could be all the more effectively built under wartime starkness and post-war economy. 

They were intended to be lighter in weight than their sister trains, the Merchant Navy class, to allow use on a more extensive assortment of courses, incorporating into the south-west of England and the Kent coast. They were a blended traffic configuration, being similarly skilled at pulling traveler and cargo prepares, and were utilized on a wide range of administrations, oftentimes far underneath their abilities. A sum of 110Â locomotives were developed somewhere in the range of 1945 and 1950, named after West Country resorts or Royal Air Force (RAF) and different subjects related with the Battle of Britain. 

Because of issues with a portion of the new highlights, for example, the Bulleid chain-driven valve gear, sixty trains were modified by British Railways amid the late 1950s. The outcomes were like the revamped Merchant Navy class. The classes worked until July 1967, when the keep going steam trains on the Southern Region were pulled back. Albeit most were rejected, twenty trains are saved on legacy railroads in Britain. 

The money related achievement delighted in by the Southern Railway amid the 1930s depended on the fruition of its London rural zap conspire in 1929 and the resulting charge of the primary lines to Brighton and the Sussex Coast and to Guildford and Portsmouth. In spite of zap designs, the Southern Railway's less intensely utilized lines in the West Country past Salisbury did not justify the expense. Lines in Devon and Cornwall were wandering, vigorously reviewed, and in spite of the fact that with overwhelming summer occasion traffic were gently utilized amid the winter months. The regularity of railroad traffic implied that the West Country branches were worked by the maturing T9Â class 4-4-0 and the adaptable NÂ class 2-6-0, which could be better used on blended traffic benefits somewhere else. Accordingly, a request was set with Brighton railroad works in April 1941 for twenty traveler trains of a sort to be resolved. 

Amid 1943, Bulleid started getting ready for the post-war train prerequisites of the railroad and recognized the requirement for a stop-hole steam train plan for those principle lines in South East England planned for zap, had the Second World War not occurred. In spite of the fact that the new Merchant Navy class was accessible for the heaviest Continental communicates, the resumption of incessant traveler benefits over ineffectively looked after foundation, following the war, would require a lighter train with more extensive course accessibility. 

In the meantime, there would be a proceeding with requirement for quick cargo trains, equipped for working on both energized and non-jolted courses, without obstructing the escalated utilization of the framework by traveler trains. Rural charge utilized electric numerous units, which had no proportional cargo structure. Despite the fact that Bulleid constructed two model electric trains in 1941, these were, up 'til now, dubious, and cargo haulage would be embraced by steam footing for years to come. 

The point by point configuration work for the new blended traffic trains was attempted at Brighton railroad works where they were planned to be developed. The most punctual illustrations were for a respectably measured 2-6-0 with likenesses to the London and North Eastern Railway K4Â class, which Bulleid had helped structure for the West Highland Line when he was Nigel Gresley's associate. Notwithstanding, such a structure would have been deficient for the Kent Coast lines, which required a ground-breaking 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 class. It isn't clear why the structure was in this manner developed to turn into a littler adaptation of the Merchant Navy class 4-6-2 as the possible traffic necessity did not warrant such rich arrangement, however the consolidation of parts from that class empowered institutionalization amid wartime creation troubles. 

So as to enhance the course accessibility of the Merchant Navy class with its 21-ton hub stacking, the weight was decreased by 5 tons. This enabled the plan to work on courses where the Maunsell 2-6-0s were the biggest allowed and came for the most part from a few changes: 

Additionally the taxi was diminished in width and renovated to conform to decreased stacking check over certain courses. 

In light of the mechanical experience picked up from the Merchant Navy trains, Bulleid consolidated his chain-driven valve gear into what turned into the new structure. This now-scandalous segment was remarkable in British train plan. It picked up reputation since it was hard to get to when things turned out badly and, pair with the quick moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause sporadic valve developments. The whole framework was in a fixed oil shower, another interesting structure, that gave consistent grease to the moving parts. 

The train likewise conveyed a comparable "air-smoothed" packaging to the Merchant Navy class. This was not viewed as streamlining by Bulleid, a reality exhibited by the level front end. Experts vary with regards to the motivation behind the packaging. As indicated by Creer it was planned to be a guide in cleaning the train with carriage washers to diminish work necessities amid the post-war period, while Bradley attests that the goal was to lift the steam and fumes gases from the taxi. Similarly as with the Merchant Navies, the class before long picked up the moniker "Spam Cans", because of the likeness to the unmistakable tin jars in which "SPAM" was sold. 

The smokebox was a vital piece of the air-smoothed packaging, being a sheet metal manufacture to a similar profile as the firebox that went about as a previous to keep up the state of the packaging. In the middle of, the packaging was bolstered by channel-segment steel crinolines (strengtheners used to keep up the shape) joined to the casings. The smokebox housed the five-spout LemaÃ®tre blastpipe masterminded around inside an expansive breadth stack. 

Similarly as with the Merchant Navy class, electric lighting was given on both train and footplate, controlled by a steam-fueled generator beneath the footplate. The checks were lit by ultra-violet light. This empowered more clear evening vision of the evaporator steam weight measure and the brake pipe vacuum weight check while dispensing with astonish, making it simpler for the group to see motions along the track. Close consideration was paid to the ergonomics of the taxi, which was planned with the controls required for task gathered by the necessities of both driver and fire fighter, in this manner advancing safe activity. As a guide to the fire fighter, a treadle utilized steam strain to open the firehole entryways, where the coal is scooped into the firebox. The footplate was totally encased, improving team working conditions in winter. Different refinements and advancements utilized on the Merchant Navy class included steam-fueled fasten brakes and the strange 6Â ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels. 

Contrasted and the Merchant Navy class, shorter by and large length prompted shorter casings and diminished the wheelbase to . 

The evaporator was additionally shorter and of littler width at the smokebox end, yet holding the working weight. 

The internal and external Belpaire firebox was additionally littler than the Merchant Navy class likewise built utilizing welded steel. 

The chambers were littler at . 

Bulleid planned a diminished limit delicate dependent on the Merchant Navy variant. It could convey water and of coal on a six-wheel underframe. It held the BFB haggles boards, or "raves", that gave the highest point of the delicate a comparative cross-sectional diagram to carriages. Likewise with the Merchant Navy class, the water tank was of welded sheet development to spare weight, and the delicate was fitted with vacuum braking gear of a catch type like that on the train. Four train-brake vacuum repositories of round and hollow development were assembled on the tank top, behind the coal space. 

The principal cluster of twenty trains was requested in April 1941, in spite of the fact that the adjustments in plan to the "Light Pacific" course of action implied that creation was deferred until late 1944. Because of wartime provisional labor at Brighton works, the boilers were worked under contract at the North British Locomotive Company. Before the first of the class had been conveyed, the request was expanded to thirty, with a second cluster of ten arranged in September 1944. Conveyances from Brighton works started in May 1945 with model No. 21C101 "Exeter", and continued at the rate of around two trains for every month. The class was step by step kept running in on the Central Section until October 1945, when they were effectively trialed on Plymouth and Kentish administrations. When the initial fifteen had entered traffic a further request of fifteen was set, with these entering administration among June and October 1946. From this group onwards, footing was improved by the option of steam sanding to the front driving wheel, with spreads added to shield the movement from sand tumbling from the filler funnels. 

A third group of twenty-five was requested and assigned the "Skirmish of Britain" class. These were indistinguishable toward the "West Country" class and the new assignment was absolutely worried about giving the trains names that befitted their planned designation toward the Eastern Section. When of the nationalization of British Railways in January 1948, seventy "Light Pacifics" had been worked at Brighton Works, with a fourth cluster of twenty on request. There was a postponement underway amid the initial three months of British Railways control however the last twenty arranged by the Southern Railway entered traffic between April 1948 and February 1949. 

In March 1949, British Railways requested a last 20 from Brighton works in spite of a squeezing requirement for littler tank trains. This lopsidedness was redressed by structure forty-one instances of the LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T for the Southern Region. Additionally as of now Brighton works staff were entangled in the troubles related with Bulleid's trial and tricky Leader class. Thus, Brighton looked for help from the other Southern Region attempts to finish this last request. Ashford works cut the edges and developed the tenders, and Eastleigh works built six of the last group of trains. 

The finish of the last train, No. 34110 "66 Squadron", in January 1951 was deferred for a while pending thought of proposition from British Railways the executives for a noteworthy alteration to a standard two-chamber structure without the chain-driven valve gear., yet the train entered administration as Bulleid expected. 

The initial six trains were at first fitted with compressed wood sheeting over the taxi side windows as a wartime material-sparing measure, with No. 21C107 "Wadebridge" the first to get glass windows. Two of the front course marker irons (of which there are five) were initially situated on the smoke redirectors, which implied that the pointer plates stood pleased with the packaging. This required a preliminary movement to the smokebox entryway at the three and nine o'clock positions on No. 21C109 "Lyme Regis", and fitted as standard from No. 21C118 "Axminster" onwards. The cluster built among June and October 1946 got a changed steam controller and LMS-style parallel cushion housings. 

Similarly as with the Merchant Navy class, they were fitted with another structure of taxi front scene plates from midâ 1947 because of poor forward perceivability. The little windows on the front substance of the taxi were upgraded to a calculated profile, giving improved perceivability to the driver. This was an element fitted to all Bulleid-planned trains post-nationalization. They were presented in Britain in 1934 with the Gresley-planned "Cockerel o' the North". Throughout the following decade the changed structure was fitted to existing individuals from the class. Another alteration was the decrease of kettle strain to diminish upkeep costs. 

The Southern Railway-fabricated clusters had a limited footplate because of the width-confined Hastings Line among Tonbridge and Hastings yet these were never utilized on this obligation and the taxi was augmented to on the British Railways bunch. The tenders of Nos. 21C166â 21C170 were fitted with TIA ("Traitement Integral Armand") synthetic feed-water gear that encouraged scale-shaping constituents in the hard water of southern England into a non-cement mud that could be cleared utilizing a manual "blow-down" valve. This hardware was reflectively fitted to before individuals from the class. In 1948 the delicate structure was expanded to give a water limit of . 

To ease upkeep and oil, boards of air-smoothed packaging in front of the chambers were expelled from 1952, and the front sanders were blanked off. This agreed with the expulsion of the delicate "raves" on everything except five trains, as they impeded the pressing of coal into the fortification and confined the driver's view while switching. The resultant "chop down" delicate included new, encased capacity for flame irons and glass exhibition plates to shield the team from flying coal dust when running delicate first. 

At the point when the reconstructing program (see underneath) was stopped in 1961, further adjustments were made to the unrebuilt trains. The most remarkable was on No. 34064 "Contender Command", which was fitted with a Giesl ejector in 1962 in light of the fact that an ideal sparkle arrestor would "choke" a common blastpipe. Following some change, the ejector improved smoke diversion and fuel utilization, enabling it to steam well with poor quality coal. As a result of the positive involvement with No. 34064, protected No. 34092 "City of Wells" was likewise fitted in the mid-1980s. 

Bulleid utilized the equivalent peculiar numbering plan that he had utilized for the Merchant Navy class, starting at No. 21C101 and coming to No. 21C170 at the season of nationalization. His plan was canceled by British Railways, which renumbered existing these 34001-34070 and new trains 34071-34110. 

The initial 48 individuals from the class were named after spots in the West Country served by its trains or near its lines. This spoke to an attention accomplishment because of a significant number of the trains having the capacity to visit their namesake territories. Many 'West Country' trains brandished an extra plaque with the emblem of the town or area the train was named after. This plaque was mounted on the packaging between the gunmetal train nameplate and the "West Country Class" look, over the center driving wheel. A few individuals from the class had just the nameplate and the "West Country Class" look over, a hole being left where a peak would have been mounted. The foundation of the nameplate was generally painted red, however now and again precedents could be found in dark if the train works undertaking update of the motor couldn't find the right shading paint. 

When it turned out to be evident that the trains would be utilized further abroad than the West Country, a choice was made to name the rest of RAF squadrons, landing strips, officers and flying machine that had taken an interest in the Battle of Britain over Kent, Surrey and Sussex. 'Clash of Britain' nameplates joined the name of the train with the class name underneath, in a structure that looked like the wings of an air ship. This was painted Air Force blue, however different hues were now and again substituted for indistinguishable reasons from above. An enameled peak of the air ship, identity or squadron was put underneath the nameplate, in a similar position as the West Country class identical. 

The primary trains developed by British Railways were of the Battle of Britain class, however the naming approach returned toward the West Country for Nos. 34091â 34108. The last two trains were Battle of Britain class, No. 34109 "Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory" and No. 34110 "66 Squadron". The aftereffect of the postponement in finishing was that the squadron peak for "66 Squadron" was never made, as the maker had resigned amid the interceding time frame. In this way "66 Squadron" was the main Battle of Britain class part not to have a peak. 

The first expectation was to base the principal cluster of trains at Exmouth Junction warehouse at Exeter for use on the West of England Main Line to Salisbury and Plymouth, and auxiliary lines to Barnstaple, Bude and other occasion resorts in Devon and Cornwall. By the winter of 1945, there was an all the more squeezing requirement for them on Kent Coast administrations. The class additionally started to be utilized on Continental Boat Trains to and from Dover and Folkestone once these were continued in 1946. Later clusters were utilized on crosscountry administrations, for example, the Brighton to Bournemouth, Cardiff and Plymouth trains or the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway trains from Bournemouth to Wells and Bath. 

As a result of the great course accessibility the trains could be utilized on non-jolted lines among London and Brighton. These incorporated the Oxted Line, and sometimes the Bluebell Line between East Grinstead and Lewes, where they were likewise utilized for cargo and packages traffic, and trip prepares over jolted lines. In this way the first expectation for the West Country class trains to work in South West England and the Battle of Britain class in Kent, Hampshire, Sussex and Surrey was never operationally down to earth and the two classes were to be discovered everywhere throughout the system. The most vital adventure embraced by an individual from the class happened on 30 January 1965, when No.34051 "Winston Churchill" pulled the memorial service train of its namesake from Waterloo station to his last resting spot, near Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. 

Similarly as with the Merchant Navy class, they could produce incredible power utilizing fair quality fuel, due generally to Bulleid's superb heater. They additionally ran easily at fast, yet they were likewise plague with a similar specialized issues of their bigger sisters. These might be abridged as pursues: 

Limited driver perceivability was referenced in the report on the grievous Lewisham rail crash on 4 December 1957 outside St John's railroad station, in which 90 individuals were executed and 173 harmed. The driver of No. 34066 "Firecracker" had neglected to see one yellow and one twofold yellow "alert" motion in foggy conditions and was making a trip too quick to even think about stopping when he saw a red flag, and the train collided with the back of a stationary nearby train. Individuals from the class were later fitted with Automatic Warning System gear, a proposal of the episode report; fitting of trackside hardware was at that point in progress, yet need had been given to courses outfitted with semaphore signals, not electric "shading light" motions as at Lewisham. 

The report on the catastrophe showed that it was vital, with the signs concerned being on the right-hand side of the train and due to the restricted perceivability from the left-hand side of a steam train, for either the fire fighter to watch those signs (yet with the driver being in charge of requesting that he do as such) or for the driver to traverse the footplate from his left-hand driving position to watch them from the opposite side. In the occasion, the driver did not one or the other, and neither driver nor fire fighter paid special mind to the part of the signs. The report credited fault to the driver, yet suggested that the class be fitted with more extensive windscreens to improve perceivability, taking note of that, in mist with under 80 yards of perceivability, the three signs included would not be noticeable at all from the driver's side of the footplate; notwithstanding, it noticed that, even from a Schools class train with its a lot littler evaporator, it was far-fetched that these signs could have been seen from the driver's side in the thick foggy states of the episode. The report did not propose that poor lifting of smoke discouraged perceivability. 

Because of the issues experienced with the class, and following the achievement of the modified Merchant Navy class structured by R. G. Jarvis, British Railways requested the reconstructing of sixty trains to an increasingly traditional plan at Eastleigh somewhere in the range of 1957 and 1961. The principal train to be remade was No. 34005 "Barnstaple", which embraced numerous highlights from the BR 'Standard' train classes. The packaging was expelled and supplanted with regular kettle cladding, evaporator weight diminished to and the chain-driven valve gear was supplanted with adjusted Walschaerts valve gear fitted both outside just as between the edges. The quick beginning of the 1955 Modernisation Plan amid the mid 1960s implied that the staying fifty trains were not revamped, and proceeded in as-assembled condition until withdrawal. 

The modifying tackled the vast majority of the support issues while holding the phenomenal highlights of the first structure. Fix costs were diminished by up to 60%, and coal utilization was decreased by up to 8.4%. Anyway the Walschaerts valve gear made the revamps heavier and inclined to hammerblow on the track, a grievance that was not clear with the first structure. The expanded weight diminished their course accessibility, implying that they couldn't be utilized on specific courses accessible to un-reconstructed precedents, for example, the line to Ilfracombe. 

The zap of the Chatham Main Line to Dover and Ramsgate in 1959 denied the class of a portion of its work, as did the exchange of the lines west of Salisbury toward the Western Region on 30 December 1962. This brought about the withdrawal of a few unrebuilt trains stabled at Exmouth Junction shed in June 1963. Before the year's over ten had been pulled back, including the 12âyear-old No. 34110 "66 Squadron", having voyage just 600,000Â miles. The vast majority of the unrebuilt trains were pulled back throughout the following three years however seven made due until 1967 and the finish of steam on the Southern Region. Numerous revamped trains were pulled back not long after their modifying. The first was No. 34028 "Eddystone" in May 1964, having run just 287,000Â miles since remaking. Other early withdrawals incorporated No. 34109 "Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory" which had just voyage 162,000Â miles in the three and a half years since its reconstructing. 

Twenty "Light Pacifics" still exist, in changing conditions of protection: two were obtained legitimately from BR for conservation, 34023 "Blackmoor Vale" and 34051 "Winston Churchill"; the other eighteen being acquired from Barry Scrapyard. Of these twenty class individuals to endure, ten are in unique structure, while ten are in "reconstructed" structure. Had it not been for Woodham Brothers' scrapyard in Barry, South Wales, no revamped "Light Pacifics" would have been saved. Eleven of the enduring motors are named after West Country areas in the South of England and the staying nine after RAF Squadrons or critical people, including Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Everything except one of the class in protection were worked at Brighton Works, the special case being 34101 "Hartland" which was worked at Eastleigh Works. The class has turned out to be valuable for safeguarding social orders, because of its great course accessibility and plentiful power, with some having come back to the fundamental line to pull exceptional trains. It is unsure whether the majority of the safeguarded trains will be reestablished to working request; inferable from the poor condition some of them were in when acquired and the expanding cost of materials. 

Different relics of the two classes that have endure are nameplates, which were expelled towards the finish of steam on the British Railways Southern Region during the 1960s. Thus, many exist in private accumulations, and a few have been seen at closeout, selling for a few a large number of pounds. 

Only four individuals from the class are yet to keep running in safeguarding: 34010 "Sidmouth", which is anticipating reclamation from scrapyard condition (its heater is put away at Bridgnorth); 34051 "Winston Churchill", which is on static showcase at the National Railway Museum in York; 34058 "Sir Frederick Pile", which is under rebuilding at the Mid Hants Railway; and 34073 "249 Squadron", which is anticipating rebuilding at Carnforth MPD. Of the sixteen motors which have worked in safeguarding, six have worked on the primary line: 34016 "Bodmin", 34027 "Taw Valley", 34046 "Braunton", 34067 "Tangmere", 34072 "257 Squadron" and 34092 "City of Wells". 34046 is the main individual from the class working right now that has a legitimate fundamental line testament. 34028 "Eddystone" and 34070 "Manston" did quickly come back to the mainline in 2009 to go to an occasion at Eastleigh, however the two motors were towed behind a diesel as nor was mainline ensured. . 

Uniform was Southern Railway malachite green with "Daylight yellow" level covering. A round cast metal plate with a red foundation on the smokebox entryway highlighted "Southern" and the date of production. Bulleid supported a mainland style of numbering, putting together this with respect to his encounters at the French part of Westinghouse Electric before the First World War, and his residency in the Railway Operating Division (R.O.D.) amid that contention. The Southern Railway number adjusted the UIC characterization framework where "2" and "1" allude to the quantity of un-fueled driving and trailing axles individually, and "C" alludes to the quantity of driving axles, for this situation three. In any case, since "21C" was the prefix effectively utilized by the Merchant Navy class, the addition "1" was included; these trains conveyed numbers that began "21C1" trailed by the individual two-digit identifier. 

Introductory uniform after nationalization in 1948 was British Railways malachite green and "Daylight yellow" coating and lettering, with British Railways on the delicate. No. 34090 "Sir Eustace Missenden, Southern Railway" was given dedicatory malachite green attire that included green-painted wheels with yellow edges and the early British Railways peak on the delicate. The Bulleid numbering framework was briefly held on the initial seventy trains with the expansion of a "s" prefix (for example s21C101). The classes were given a few power groupings in their professions, starting with 6MT (Mixed Traffic) in 1949. In December 1953 they were renamed 7P 5FA, the "An" indicating brake control when utilized on unfitted (non-vacuum braked) products trains. The revamped trains held this grouping until all got the characterization of 7P6F between November 1957 and November 1961. 

The trains were turned out in British Railways Brunswick green uniform with orange and dark fixing with the British Railways peak on the delicate side, after their first update under new possession. This was not normal for the Merchant Navy class, which was at first turned out in British Railways test express traveler blue uniform. By this stage, the Southern Railway-fabricated trains were re-liveried and renumbered from 34001â 34070. The modified trains were likewise in British Railways Brunswick green with orange and dark covering, and peak on the delicate side, while the nameplates were put on a uniquely designed mounting on the running plate because of the nonattendance of a level surface. 

A portion of the trains had extra embellishments. No. 34050 "Illustrious Observer Corps" was given a ROC long-administration award in July 1961. The service occurred at Waterloo station, and included Commandant ROC Air Commodore Wight-Boycott. The taxi side was given a portrayal of the decoration and its lace, which was shown until the motor was pulled back from administration and rejected in the late 1960s. The first nameplate and peak were recuperated and showed in the passageway corridor of ROC Headquarters at RAF Bentley Priory until 1996 when they were exchanged to the RAF Museum at Hendon. Another train that highlighted a second peak was 34067 "Tangmere", which was given the landing strip's peak for the taxi side, as it didn't include on the nameplate peak. 

The class in both unrebuilt and reconstructed structures has been the subject of unique conclusions. The utilization of welded steel development and the different advancements that had not recently been found in British train configuration implied that the class earned Bulleid the title "Last Giant of Steam". The steam-raising capacity of their boilers spoke to a development in British steam innovation. Their light pivot stacking additionally implied across the board use over the Southern system, and they were prepared to do quick running. 

In spite of these triumphs, the quantity of advancements presented in the meantime made the class temperamental and hard to keep up. A lot of cash was squandered on settling the issues of a class intended for obligations that could have been attempted by less expensive 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 blended traffic trains. In like manner, progressively "Light Pacifics" were worked than were required, as often as possible endeavor undertakings that would as a rule befit an a lot littler train. An inquisitive however normal sight west of Exeter amid the winter months was a "Light Pacific" pulling a nearby halting administration with a solitary carriage to goals as various as Padstow and Wadebridge. At long last, a lot of cash was spent on the costly revamping system when dieselisation and modernisation implied the trains would have restricted lives in their new appearance. 

Kitmaster delivered an unpowered polystyrene infusion shaped unit for 00 check from 1960. In late 1962, the brand was sold to Airfix, which continued creation in 1968. The molds later go to Dapol, which keeps on creating the pack. Hornby fabricates prepared to-run revamped and un-reconstructed instances of the class and caters for all the real detail varieties. Graham Farish produces prepared to-run models in N measure, and Dapol has reported its expectation to create models in N check, slated for discharge in May 2012. Hornby Dublo delivered diecast metal "revamped" West Countries during the 1960s, and those moved toward becoming Triang-Wrenn, and eventually Wrenn Railways. Wrenn delivered air-smoothed adaptations and revamped variants, directly through to their end (and ensuing deal to Dapol) in the mid 1990s.
