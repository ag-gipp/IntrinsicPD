Raised seven days before No. 451 Squadron, it was the primary Australian squadron built up for administration with the British military under the Article XV of the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). No. 450 Squadron was proposed to be an "invasion" squadron, which would comprise at first just of ground team and would get a core of experienced pilots subsequent to touching base in its assigned performance center of activities. 

Initiated at Ottawa, Canada, in October 1939, EATS was an arrangement to extend the Royal Air Force's (RAF) ability to prepare aircrews by making a pool of staff from different Commonwealth nationsâAustralia, Canada, Britain and New Zealandâthrough the foundation of a typical preparing framework comprising of a progression of beginning, rudimentary, and propelled preparing schools. At the finish of cutting edge preparing, faculty were presented as required on RAF-controlled squadrons in Britain or the Middle East. These squadrons were assigned as either RAF, RAAF, Royal Canadian Air Force or Royal New Zealand Air Force squadrons, however were paid for and regulated by the British government, and faculty could be drawn from any Commonwealth country. Seventeen RAAF squadrons were shaped amid the war under Article XV of the understanding. 

Under the transitory direction of Flight Lieutenant Bruce Shepherd, No. 450 Squadron left Australia on 11 April 1941, leaving on the troopship "Ruler Elizabeth" at Sydney, and touching base in Egypt on 3 May. At RAF Abu Sueir, Squadron Leader Gordon Steege took order of the squadron before it was joined with the pilots and Hawker Hurricanes of No. 260 Squadron RAF, which had been built up without ground group, to shape an operational squadron. The consolidated unit, known as No. 260/450 (Hurricane) Squadron, at that point migrated to Amman in Transjordan. Its first task was on 29 June 1941, when the Hurricanes assaulted Vichy French runways and foundation amid the intrusion of Syria.

By December 1941, the squadron was getting pilots and it started taking conveyance of Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk contenders. On 19 December, RAF Middle East Command issued a regulatory guidance pronouncing that albeit kept an eye on essentially by Australians, Nos. 450 and 451 Squadrons were "paid by and credited to the Royal Air Force under the Empire Air Training Scheme and for every single pragmatic reason they ought to be viewed as R.A.F. squadrons inside and out". Disarray ruled for a period, yet after mediation by the British Air Ministry, a further report on 23 January 1942 declared that "450 and 451 E.A.T.S. Squadrons are to be viewed as R.A.A.F. squadrons". Preparing started that month, and No. 450 Squadron started activities from RAF Gambut on 19 February 1942, with an uneventful watch close Tobruk.

That month it flew more than 300 fights. Further moves happened, and by mid-April it was based at Karouan.

Because of its contribution in the North African battling, the squadron got the moniker, "The Desert Harassers", and received the aphorism, "Hassle", the two of which were gotten from a remark by the Nazi purposeful publicity supporter "Master Haw", who depicted the unit as "Australian hired fighters whose annoying strategies were effectively beaten off by the "Luftwaffe"." 

Following the finish of the battling in the desert, No. 450 Squadron was dispensed a ground-assault job amid the Allied attack of Sicily.

Cutella landing strip was found near the shoreline; overwhelming downpours caused a tempest flood on 1 January 1944 and overflowed the runway, harming some flying machine. 

In the interim, Williams and another wartime captive from No. 450 Squadron, Flight Lieutenant Reginald Kierath, were imprisoned with other Allied POWs at "Stalag Luft III", in eastern Germany. In March 1944, both partook in "The Great Escape" and were among 50 POWs killed by the "Gestapo", in the wake of being recovered. Williams, who was 27 years of age and from Sydney, was authoritatively a RAF officer, as he had joined the British administration under a short administration commission in 1938. Kierath, who was 29 and from Narromine, New South Wales, was a RAAF officer. 

All through January 1944, No. 450 Squadron attempted enemy of delivery activities just as ground bolster assignments. It flew missions against focuses off Dalmatia and in the harbor at Sibenik, just as around the ports of Velaluka and Zera. In March, the squadron's consideration came back to Italy, propelling strikes against moving stock; the next month saw it vigorously entrusted, flying a sum of 430 forays.

No. 450 Squadron endured no fatalities or flying machine crushed however the pilot of a buoy plane having a place with an air-ocean salvage unit was slaughtered, some ground work force were injured, a Kittyhawk of No. 3 Squadron was demolished and a few others were harmed. The next month, No. 450 Squadron moved to San Angelo, mounting a progression of assaults against a 200-vehicle guard close Subiaco working together with other Kittyhawk squadrons that guaranteed 123 vehicles devastated or harmed. No. 450 Squadron later worked from a few runways in focal and northern Italy, under the "taxi rank" framework, whereby watching contender planes would assault as mentioned by armed force air contact officers. It flew more than 1,100 fights in June and July. The Australian Kittyhawk units were normally commended for the precision of their attacks; following a mission by No. 450 Squadron on 12 July, the Eighth Army wired No. 239 Wing home office: "Amazing shelling. Great show and bless your heart. No further assaults required." 

No. 450 Squadron participated in the real hostile against the Gothic Line in Augustâ September 1944. Its first assault toward the beginning of August was a strike on a mounted guns battery, amid which three Kittyhawks were shot down; consequent assaults all through the next months were made against different targets including moving stock, reinforcement, and troop focuses. From November, after it had moved to Fano on the Italian north-east coast, the squadron likewise started assaulting German powers in Yugoslavia. Its normal supplement of pilots amid the second 50% of 1944 was 25 from the RAAF, seven from the RAF and five from the South African Air Force.

Amid the war, it had lost 63 work force murdered in real life, of whom 49 were Australian. 

The squadron was not re-raised by the RAAF after the war, in spite of the fact that the numerical assignment of "450" was accepted by a Canadian helicopter unit, 450 Tactical Helicopter Squadron, in March 1968. The utilization of the "450" assignment was the aftereffect of a managerial mistake, as the Canadian 400 arrangement squadrons framed amid World War II had been numbered somewhere in the range of 400 and 449. An understanding was thusly come to between the RCAF and RAAF and the squadron kept the assignment. It is based at Petawawa, in Ontario, and works Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters.
