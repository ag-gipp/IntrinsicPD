"Contact Me I'm Sick" was discharged as Mudhoney's introduction single by free record mark Sub Pop on August 1, 1988. The melody's verses, which highlight dull amusingness, are a snide interpretation of issues, for example, ailment and brutal sex. 

When it was first discharged, "Contact Me I'm Sick" was a hit on the non mainstream circuit; it remains the band's most conspicuous tune. The intensely mutilated and fluffy guitars, growling vocals, obtuse bass line and fiery drumming added to a grimy sound that affected numerous nearby artists, and built up the incipient Seattle grunge scene. As per Allmusic, "the melody's crude, base vitality made it a moment song of praise which still stands as one of [grunge's] unequaled works of art". 

As per Mudhoney vocalist Mark Arm, "Contact Me I'm Sick" started from a talk with Sub Pop proprietor Bruce Pavitt, who "stated: 'Hello, you sing about canines. You sing about being wiped out. You got a shtick, it'll take you to the top.' And he essentially gave us five harmonies, yet he said don't utilize more than three inside one melody." Arm additionally expresses that "Contact Me I'm Sick" was a catchphrase around which the band assembled a tune. 

Mudhoney recorded the tune at Seattle's Reciprocal Recording studio in March 1988, three months after the band's development. Maker Jack Endino was astounded by how boisterous the sessions were and how messy the band needed the guitars to sound; "generally, I simply kind of remained back and let them go at it". Guitarist Steve Turner said that the band chosen two of their "grungiest" tunes for the single. "Sweet Young Thing Ain't Sweet No More" was to be the A-side of the single and "Contact Me I'm Sick" the B-side previously, in drummer Dan Peters' words, "that all got flipped around". 

"Contact Me I'm Sick" has a direct carport punk structure with a straightforward rehashing power harmony riff played at a high rhythm. This is joined by an unpolished bass line and frantic drumming. The tune's grimy sound was created utilizing an Electro-Harmonix Big Muff contortion pedal, which is increased by a second guitar giving more twisting. Music author Brian J. Barr alluded to this loud solid as "what might be compared to an intensified brush scratching against paper". 

Pundits have noticed a Stooges impact in "Contact Me I'm Sick", run of the mill of Mudhoney's initial material. Turner stated: "by and large, it's The Yardbirds' 'Happenings Ten Years Time Ago' by method for The Stooges' 'Tired of You'. At the time I was striving for the faltering R&B guitar of The Nights and Days." The tune is likewise reminiscent of the no-nonsense punk of Black Flag. In his book "Failure: The Real Seattle Music Story", Clark Humphrey blames the tune for being a duplicate of "The Witch" by The Sonics. The band have expelled this case, and scrutinized the author's information of music. 

Arm's verses, as indicated by commentator Steve Huey, are a tirade about "illness, self-hatred, apprehension, and messy sex". In a paper called "'Touch Me I'm Sick': Contagion as Critique in Punk and Performance Art", Catherine J. Creswell recommends that a portion of the verses allude to AIDS. As indicated by Creswell, "In pronouncing 'Admirably, I'm unhealthy and I wouldn't fret' and changing the last hold back to 'Screw Me, I'm Sick!' the speaker proclaims himself to be the viral, 'Guides bearing,' 'contaminating' individual of contemporary dream".

Be that as it may, Arm says that he had not put much idea into the verses; while playing out the tune in shows, he some of the time transforms them to divert himself. 

Another component of "Touch Me I'm Sick" that has been remarked upon is Arm's vocals. Huey alludes to them as an "insane shriek", and "growling, satanic yells". Columnist Joe Ehrbar says that Arm starts the melody with a "burp", before singing with a "nasally yell". Creswell considers Arm's "over the edge" vocals to taunt an assortment of shake generalizations: the punk growl, the "woozy slur" of hard shake, carport shake "yea-ahs", R&B-style moans and a "Jerry Lee Lewis shiver".

At the point when gotten some information about the business figures of the single, Turner answered, "The first [pressing sold] 1,000, at that point 3,000 of the reissue, at that point it was no longer in production for some time; at that point they made 2,000 more and those are presumably gone." The single's prosperity got the band unsuspecting; had at first expelled the melody as a "B-side hurl off".

There's something extraordinary about that first single, we were never entirely ready to recover that sound. I don't have a clue in the event that it was the guitars or the account. It was only an actually intense, amazing guitar sound. We've gotten some since, yet they've been an alternate kind. I think it had more to do with the genuine electromagnetic science of what was experiencing our amps that day. It was only a cool, browned out sound. 

The melody was referenced in the 1992 film "Singles", which is set against the setting of the Seattle grunge scene.
