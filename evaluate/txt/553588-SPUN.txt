Crazy person Muntz 

Baron William "Crazy person" Muntz (January 3, 1914 â June 21, 1987) was an American agent and architect who sold and advanced vehicles and customer hardware in the United States from the 1930s until his demise in 1987. He was a pioneer in TV plugs with his crackpot "Maniac" persona â a change self image who produced attention with his bizarre ensembles, stunts, and preposterous cases. Muntz additionally spearheaded vehicle sound systems by making the Muntz Stereo-Pak, also called the 4-track cartridge, an antecedent to the 8-track cartridge created by Lear Industries. 

He imagined the training that came to be known as Muntzing, which included rearranging generally entangled electronic gadgets. Muntz delivered and advertised the principal high contrast TV inputs to sell for under $100, and made one of the most punctual useful widescreen projection TVs. He was credited with authoring the truncation "television" for "TV", in spite of the fact that the term had before been being used in call letters for stations, for example, WCBS-TV. A secondary school dropout, 

Muntz made fortunes by selling cars, TV collectors, and vehicle sound systems and tapes. A 1968 "Los Angeles Times" article noticed that in one year he sold $72Â million worth of autos, that five years after the fact he sold $55Â million worth of TV recipients, and that in 1967 he sold $30Â million worth of vehicle sound systems and tapes. 

After his prosperity as a trade-in vehicle sales rep and with Kaiser-Frazer businesses in Los Angeles and New York City, Muntz established the Muntz Car Company, which made the "Muntz Jet", a games vehicle with stream like forms. The vehicle was made somewhere in the range of 1951 and 1953, albeit less than 400Â were created. 

Muntz wedded multiple times. His spouses included on-screen character Joan Barton (who showed up in "Blessed messenger and the Badman" with John Wayne) and Patricia Stevens of the Patricia Stevens Finishing Schools. Phyllis Diller was among his numerous lady friends. He was companions with big names, for example, vocalist Rudy Vallee, humorist Jerry Colonna, performer Bert Lahr, TV moderator Dick Clark, and cowpoke on-screen character Gene Autry. 

Muntz was interested by gadgets since the beginning. He manufactured his first radio at ageÂ 8 and fabricated another for his folks' vehicle at ageÂ 14. Amid the Great Depression, at ageÂ 15, he dropped out of Elgin High School to work in his folks' handyman shop in Elgin, Illinois. 

In 1934, Muntz opened his previously utilized vehicle part, in Elgin, with a $500 ($ in ) credit extension. He was just 20 years of age, and his mom needed to sign the vehicle deal papers in light of the fact that legitimately he was too youthful to even consider closing his own arrangements. Amid an excursion in California, Muntz found that trade-in vehicles sold there at far greater expenses; so he moved to California in 1940 at ageÂ 26 to open a trade-in vehicle parcel in Glendale. On a hunch, he acquired 13Â brand-new right-hand-drive vehicles to exchange. These vehicles had been worked for clients in Asia, however couldn't be conveyed because of World War II. One vehicle was a hand crafted Lincoln worked for Chiang Kai-shek. Neighborhood papers ran tales about the surprising vehicles, and Muntz sold them all inside about fourteen days, still in their unique transportation cases. Muntz before long opened a second parcel in Los Angeles and shut his part in Elgin. 

Muntz rejected the then regular supposition that trade-in vehicle sales reps should extend a staid picture. He understood the potential outcomes of creating attention with odd tricks, and built up a "Lunatic" persona therefore. His flashy bulletins and weirdo TV and radio ads before long made him acclaimed. In his utilized auto advertisements, he showcased one model as the "every day extraordinary"; Muntz asserted that if the vehicle did not sell that day, he would crush it to pieces on camera with a heavy hammer. Another infamous Muntz utilized vehicle TV pitch was "I purchase them retail and sell them discount ... it's increasingly fun that way!" His advertisements created so much attention that humorists, for example, Bob Hope, Jack Benny, and Steve Allen regularly endeavored to exceed each other amid TV appearances by telling "Crazy person" Muntz jokes. College of Southern California fans would illuminate Muntz's name amid halftime as a trick. 

Amid the war, the Office of Price Administration tried to suspend Muntz' permit to offer cars subject to value control. On August 1, 1945, Muntz was cleared of an O.P.A. charge of disregarding utilized vehicle guidelines by Superior Judge Reuben H. Schmidt in Los Angeles. 

Muntz's vehicle parts moved toward becoming vacation spots because of the far reaching exposure from his TV plug appearances. A 1946 study by "Panner Motor Tours" uncovered that they positioned seventh among vacation spots in Southern California. Muntz was happy to go for broke in his endeavors to create exposure. Amid the time of McCarthyism, he solicited one from his consultants, "Do you think I'd make the front pages on the off chance that I joined the Communist Party?" 

In 1948, race vehicle planner and Kurtis-Kraft author Frank Kurtis endeavored to showcase another games vehicle, the two-seater Kurtis Kraft Sport. Just 36Â units had been sold by 1950. In 1951, for just $200,000 ($ in ) Kurtis sold the vehicles' assembling permit to Muntz, who immediately rebadged them as the "Muntz Jet". Introductory generation of the Jet occurred in Glendale, where Muntz broadened the two-seater Kurtis Kraft Sport's body by , making it a four-seater, and traded the Ford V8 motor for a bigger Cadillac V8. Afterward, subsequent to making only 28Â Jets in California, Muntz moved creation to another processing plant in Evanston, Illinois, expanded the body further by , and supplanted the CadillacÂ V8 with a more affordable Lincoln sidevalveÂ V8. 

The Jet was included on the front of the September 1951 issue of "Well known Science" alongside a Jaguar and a MG. It highlighted its very own plan, with aluminum body boards and a removable fiberglass top. Paint plans were excessive, with names like "Mars Red", "Stratosphere Blue", and "Lime Mist", and inside alternatives included gator or Spanish leatherette. The rearward sitting arrangement armrests contained a full mixed drink bar. 

The Jet was fit for a top speed of and increasing speed of 0â 50Â mph (0â 80Â km/h) in 6Â seconds, a huge accomplishment for a street vehicle at the time. The quickest creation vehicle in 1953 was the Pegaso Z-102 Supercharged games vehicle at . Stream proprietors included then-CEO of CBS Frank Stanton, and performing artists Mickey Rooney and Lash La Rue. 

The work and materials required to create the Jet brought about a high cost for the final result and, in 1954, subsequent to selling about 400Â cars and losing about $1,000 ($ in ) on each, Muntz shut the organization. Today, Muntz Jets are prized gatherer vehicles and are perceived as forerunners to the Chevrolet Corvette and Ford Thunderbird. 

Muntz began plans to sell TV inputs in 1946, and deals started in 1947. Muntz played the lunatic in his irregular TV ads, yet in reality he was an astute specialist and a self-trained electrical designer. By experimentation, dismantling and contemplating Philco, RCA, and DuMont TVs, he made sense of how to diminish the gadgets' electrical segments to their base utilitarian number. This training wound up known as "Muntzing". 

During the 1950s, most brands of TV inputs were convoluted bits of hardware, ordinarily containing about 30Â vacuum cylinders, just as rheostats, transformers, and other overwhelming parts. Subsequently, they were normally over the top expensive: the least expensive U.S.- fabricated recipient made before World War II utilized a screen and cost $125 ($ in ); the least expensive model with a screen cost $445 ($ in ). By 1954, in spite of the fact that communicate TV in the United States had existed in different structures since 1928, just 55Â percent of U.S. family units claimed a collector. On the other hand, eightÂ years later, 90Â percent of U.S. family units had one. 

Muntz built up a TV suspension that created a worthy monochrome picture with 17Â tubes. He regularly conveyed a couple of wire scissors, and when he suspected that one of his representatives was "overengineering" a circuit, he would start cutting parts out until the image or sound quit working. By then, he would tell the specialist "Well, I surmise you need to place that last part back in" and leave. 

Promoted under the name "Muntz" by his organization Muntz TV, Inc., the streamlined units were the main highly contrasting TV recipients to retail in the U.S. for under $100. Muntz was additionally the primary retailer to gauge his screens from corner to corner instead of by width. The beneficiaries sold well and were solid somewhat in light of the fact that less cylinders made less warmth. The sets functioned admirably in metropolitan territories that were near TV transmission towers where signals were solid. They worked ineffectively with more fragile signs, as the vast majority of the parts that Muntz had evacuated were planned to help execution in periphery regions. This was a determined choice: Muntz wanted to leave the low-volume, elite TV input market to firms, for example, RCA and Zenith Electronics, as his expected clients were fundamentally urban tenants with constrained assets. Moreover, numerous urban condo structures had rules restricting outside TV radio wires, and establishment of a recieving wire, regardless of whether permitted, cost as much as $150. Muntz tackled this issue by adding an implicit recieving wire to his beneficiaries. In 1952, Muntz TV Inc. earned $49.9Â million ($ in ). 

Muntz proceeded with his "Maniac" persona in a significant number of his promotions. In one TV plug that typically circulated after "The Ed Sullivan Show", Muntz, wearing red long johns and a Napoleon cap, advanced his new TVs by saying, "I wanna give them away, yet Mrs. Muntz won't let me. She's insane!" Another TV plug exhibited a walking band tune with verses about Muntz TVs and consolidated activitys by Oskar Fischinger. His radio ads, which Muntz kept running up to 170Â times every day, at first pursued an established music subject worked around the spelling of Muntz's name. In any case, he before long persuaded radio stations to run promotions more in accordance with his persona. In one spot, Muntz shouted "Quit gazing at your radio!" He lined up his radio promotions with a post office based mail battle, gathering a large number of TV handles and mailing them to imminent clients with a note saying, "Call us and we'll appear with the remainder of the set!" 

A few sources acknowledge Muntz for designing the truncation "television". Muntz utilized skywriting as one of his advertising strategies, at the same time, in the wake of watching one of his advertisements being made, he noticed that the letters started to obscure and disseminate before the pilot could get done with spelling out "Muntz Televisions". So Muntz thought of the contraction "television". Be that as it may, "television" had prior been utilized in the call letters of TV channels, for example, WCBS-TV, which received those call letters in 1946. Muntz likewise named his little girl "Tee Vee", in spite of the fact that she typically passed by "Teena" and, later, "Tee". 

In spite of his initial achievement, deals later declined and Muntz's banks would not give further financing in 1954. Muntz conceded his business lost $1,457,000 from April to August 1953, and in spite of the fact that he endeavored to rearrange, Muntz TV petitioned for financial protection and left business in 1959. (The organization would be redesigned and last through the 1960s, yet without its namesake in charge.) However, Muntz's prosperity proceeded in the offers of vehicles and general purchaser gadgets. 

Endeavoring to consolidate his two principle product offerings, vehicles and sound systems, Muntz concocted the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the immediate ancestor of the Stereo 8 cartridge, otherwise called the 8-track, later created by American designer Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge depended on the perpetual circle Fidelipac cartridge, which was being utilized by radio stations, planned by innovator George Eash. Muntz picked stereo chronicle as a standard element as a result of its wide accessibility. Before Muntz built up the Stereo-Pak, the main in-vehicle units equipped for recorded playback were phonograph-based players, for example, the Highway Hi-Fi imagined by Peter Goldmark. These units played unique 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, anyway they would in general skip at whatever point the vehicle hit an obstruction, and endeavors to lighten this by expanding the weight on the arm made circles destroy rashly. 

Muntz planned a stereo cassette deck called the Autostereo for vehicles and had it economically produced in Japan. The Autostereo could play a total collection without changing tracks or turning the tape over, did not experience the ill effects of skipping or untimely wear as the phonograph-based players did, and its number of handles and controls were limited to enable the driver to focus out and about. The cassette deck gave clients more prominent command over their listening encounters, on the grounds that the tapes never ran ads or open administration declarations, in contrast to radio communicates. Muntz sold the players and cartridges from his very own stores and through establishments in Florida and Texas. 

Muntz sound items were so productive by 1962 that he dropped his concurrences with tape-copying organizations and established his very own organization to fabricate prerecorded Stereo-Pak cartridges. Most record organizations did not fabricate Stereo-Pak cartridges themselves; in any case, the Muntz Electronics Corporation authorized music from all the significant record names and issued many diverse tapes in the mid to late 1960s. Muntz displayed his Autostereo players and Stereo-Pak cartridges under the exchange name "Stereo-Pak" at the 1967 Consumer Electronics Show. 

The Autostereo player, which retailed from $129 in 1963 ($ in ) was a well known post-retail expansion to vehicles among the Beverly Hills rich and popular. Straightforward Sinatra utilized one in his Buick Riviera, Dean Martin in his Corvette, and Peter Lawford in his Ghia. James Garner, Red Skelton, and Lawrence Welk additionally utilized Autostereo players in their vehicles. Barry Goldwater acquired one for his child, and Jerry Lewis recorded his contents onto Stereo-Pak cartridges to get familiar with his lines while driving. 

Muntz endeavored to build up a cutting edge, in vogue picture for his players and cartridges. His print promotions frequently demonstrated the player introduced in an engaging games vehicle and normally consolidated a youthful, alluring model with a suggestive slogan. The majority of his representatives in his California shops were alluring young ladies wearing overbright garments. 

Bill Lear appropriated the Stereo-Pak in 1963, planning to introduce units in his Learjet flying machine. Be that as it may, he before long chose to re-engineer and alter the units to suit his own desires, the consequence of which turned into the StereoÂ 8 framework. The market for Muntz's 4-track framework had blurred by 1970 because of rivalry from Stereo 8, which diminished expenses by utilizing less attractive tape and a less-perplexing cartridge system. In spite of the fact that the 4-track framework had higher devotion since the tape speed was twofold the speed of the StereoÂ 8 framework (and the 4-track had more extensive heads for better data transfer capacity), the StereoÂ 8 rapidly turned into the predominant organization for vehicle sound systems amid the late 1960s. Passage Motor Company started including StereoÂ 8 players in their 1965 cars, and it turned into a standard alternative by 1966. 

In a 1979 meeting in "The Videophile" bulletin, Muntz uncovered the most serious issue for the Stereo-Pak business was returned stock. He clarified that while repeating crafted by real specialists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant needed to make a huge number of cartridges. Be that as it may, once a prevalent collection turned out to be less well known, retailers would restore the unsold cartridges, anticipating credit towards new titles. Muntz was caught off guard for the profits and said the immense expense of unsold stock in the end made his Stereo-Pak business unfruitful. 

In late 1970, Muntz shut his Stereo-Pak sound business after a flame seriously harmed his principle workplaces. He at that point entered the developing home-video advertise. Amid the mid-1970s, Muntz thought of taking a Sony shading cathode beam tube (CRT) TV input, fitting it with a unique focal point and reflecting mirror, at that point anticipating the amplified picture onto a bigger screen. He housed these crude units in a vast wooden comfort, making it one of the primary fruitful widescreen projection TV collectors advertised for home use. 

The beneficiaries were worked in Muntz's central station in Van Nuys, California. Sony's U.S. deals division was unconscious that Muntz was managing Sony's Tokyo unique gear producer (OEM) office, which delivered him the TV skeleton legitimately. Because of Muntz's ability for mass-showcase publicizing and self-advancement, by 1977 the projection collectors were a multimillion-dollar business. Muntz rushed to include Sony's Betamax just as JVC's and RCA's VHS recorders in his store, setting up a showroom to exhibit the potential for a "theater involvement in the home". 

In 1979, Muntz chose to sell clear tapes and VCRs as misfortune pioneers to draw in clients to his showroom, where he would then attempt to offer them his projection TV frameworks. His prosperity proceeded through the mid 1980s until he put vigorously in the Technicolor Compact Video Cassette (CVC), a 1/4Â inÂ (0.6Â cm) framework intended to rival Betamax, VHS, and the Super 8 film home-motion picture framework. The CVC position flopped in the commercial center, deals immediately dissolved, and Muntz's store shut before long. 

In the blink of an eye before biting the dust of lung malignant growth in 1987, Muntz fixated his retail business on mobile phones, satellite dishes, a RV rental organization named "Muntz Motor Mansions", and pre-assembled aluminum houses. He stood out as truly newsworthy in February 1985 as the principal retailer to offer a Hitachi wireless for under $1,000 ($ in ), when only two years sooner most PDAs had cost about $3,000 ($ in ). At the season of his demise, he was the main retailer of PDAs in Los Angeles. Amid his last years, Muntz drove an altered Lincoln Continental with a TV introduced in the dashboard: Muntz guaranteed it helped him "drive better". 

After he kicked the bucket, his youngsters, James and Tee, kept on working two Muntz stores in Van Nuys and Newhall; the rest of the stores were diversified organizations. James utilized his dad's publicizing systems to make splashy promotions including costs that irritated his rivals so much that they alluded to them as "vicious". 

The "Psycho" technique spearheaded by Muntz was later replicated by different retailers, including California vehicle sales rep Cal Worthington and New York region hardware chain Crazy Eddie. In Crazy Eddie TV plugs, radio character Jerry Carroll jumped at the camera and hopped around while babbling at fast, continually finishing with the line, "Insane Eddie: Our costs are insaaaaaane!" because of his Crazy Eddie ads, Carroll turned into a huge 80s symbol, notwithstanding showing up in the film "Sprinkle". 

Muntz's social effect was with the end goal that he was referenced in books, including kids' book "The Neddiad: How Neddie Took The Train, Went To Hollywood, And Saved Civilization" by Daniel Manus Pinkwater, "The Lost Get-Back Boogie" by James Lee Burke, and Franklin Mason's "Four Roses in Three Acts ". 

A creation called "Lunatic Muntz: American Maverick" was screened at film celebrations through 2007. Coordinated by Dan Bunker and Judy ver Mehr, it was created by Jim Castoro, a proprietor of a unique Muntz Jet. The film was an authority 2005 determination at the San Fernando Valley International Film Festival and the Ole Muddy Film Festival. The film archives Muntz's life, giving specific consideration to his bright profession, and incorporates interviews with individuals who knew him and home motion picture film contributed by his youngsters. 

The KCET 1997 narrative "More Things That Aren't Here Anymore" has a portion on Muntz and is communicated by the station routinely amid promise periods. 

In 2001, Madman Muntz was after death drafted into the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame.
