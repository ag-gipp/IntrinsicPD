The vocalist and lyricist Skylar Gray composed and recorded a demo of the tune close by the maker Alex da Kid when she believed she was in a harsh sentimental association with the music business. Eminem composed the refrains and picked Rihanna to sing the ensemble, bringing about a joint effort impacted by their past encounters in troublesome connections. Recording sessions were held in Ferndale, Michigan, and Dublin, Ireland. Sponsored by guitar, piano and violin, the track is a midtempo hip-jump anthem with a pop hold back, sung by Rihanna, and portrays two darlings who will not separate in spite of being in an unsafe loveâ abhor relationship. 

Interscope Records discharged the melody in June 2010 as the second single from "Recuperation". Pundits commended its song yet were isolated on topical viewpoints, for example, power and exactness. Eminem advanced the single with exhibitions at the 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo, the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards and celebrations. The music video, coordinated by Joseph Kahn, stars Dominic Monaghan and Megan Fox in a vicious relationship and shows Eminem and Rihanna before a consuming house. The clasp had a blended gathering because of scenes of abusive behavior at home. Correspondents proposed that the tune and its going with video were affected by Eminem's and Rihanna's associations with their separate ex-darlings Kimberly Scott and Chris Brown. 

Faultfinders recorded "Love the Way You Lie" among the best tracks of 2010 and of Eminem's profession. The melody won numerous honors and got five Grammy selections. It is Eminem's smash hit single and positioned number one on a few record graphs, including the United States' "Board" Hot 100 for sevenÂ weeks. The single sold sixÂ million duplicates in the US and one million in the UK. Melodic acts, for example, Cher Lloyd and The Band Perry have performed spread adaptations. Rihanna has said that the topic of abusive behavior at home, a subject on which she guarantees numerous individuals don't have understanding, is the thing that makes the tune powerful. She later recorded "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)", described generally from her point of view. 

Advancement of "Adoration the Way You Lie" started with the sponsorship track and snare tune, which was made by the British hip jump maker Alex da Kid. When making a track, he said he invests hours making circles and creates an electronic drum beat before including live instrumentation. The drums are tested from live accounts he spares. Alex da Kid recorded an acoustic guitar for the sections with a Georg Neumann U87 mouthpiece and an Avid Mbox sound interface. He told "Sound on Sound" magazine that this tune had allowed him a chance to reintroduce live guitar in hip jump music. Amid the session, he utilized Waves RVerb and REQ adjustment on his primary kick track and a MaxxBass module on two others. 

Composing started in late 2009, when the American artist Holly Hafermann dwelled at the Artula Retreat in Bandon, Oregon, and created melodies. Afterward, in New York City, under her new stage name Skylar Gray, she visited her Universal Music distributer, Jennifer Blakeman, to look for help exhibiting her work; Blakeman recommended she team up with Alex da Kid. The maker messaged Gray his track, which recommended a topic of oppressive sentimental connections to her as she precipitously sang verses to the tune. She told the "Los Angeles Times" that she was in an injurious association with the music business: "I adore it so much, and I give everything that I have, yet it thrashes me." This thought propelled her composition, a procedure she discovered fell into place without any issues, as though she were making an elective pop melody for herself. She composed the ensemble to "Love the Way You Lie" in fifteenÂ minutes and recorded vocals for Alex da Kid's demo. 

In mid 2010, Alex da Kid offered the Shady Records Senior Director Rigo "Riggs" Morales some support tracks. Spirits delighted in the tracks and sent them to Eminem, who was looking for an alternate melodic methodology for his next collection. Inspired with Alex da Kid's work, Eminem requested more tracks and in this manner heard "Love the Way You Lie". He picked it and told his administrator Paul Rosenberg he needed to work together with the Barbadian artist Rihanna. Eminem told Skyrock, "It's one of those tracks that I felt like no one but she could pull it off." Rosenberg sent the track to Rihanna, who acknowledged Eminem's solicitation "at last." Eminem then composed the rapped sections. 

Rihanna said she joined the coordinated effort since she could identify with the topic of the melody, as she and Eminem had been in troublesome connections on "various closures of the table". Eminem had discharged the melodies "'97 Bonnie and Clyde" (1998) and "Kim" (2000), in which he fantasizes, individually, about killing and verbally manhandling his then-spouse Kimberly Scott. They had separated in 2001 and again in 2006 after a remarriage. In February 2009, Rihanna's association with the American artist Chris Brown had finished after his crime attack on her. Rihanna depicted "Love the Way You Lie" as extraordinary, practical and profound, saying that it "separated the cycle of abusive behavior at home" since few individuals had knowledge on the point. 

Mike Strange recorded and blended Eminem's vocals at Effigy Studios in Ferndale, Michigan. The sessions took two days. Unusual altered the vocals with D-Verbâa resonation programmingâand an Extra Long Delay module. He liked to roll out couple of improvements; for "Affection the Way You Lie" he only utilized board pressure and reassure evening out. Unusual utilized the Bricasti and Eventide Reverb 2016 blending devices for "more brilliant" resonation. Detroit performer Luis Resto has added to the plan on huge numbers of Eminem's tunes, yet did not do as such for "Affection the Way You Lie". As indicated by Strange, "All that we required was at that point in the track, aside from the vocals." Two to threeÂ weeks after the sessions, Alex da Kid touched base to help blend and ace the track. He needed to supplant the acoustic guitar on the demo, yet Eminem kept it. Bizarre stated, "It was just a question of attempting to match and afterward to enhance the demo [Alex da Kid]'d sent us." Strange's sibling Joe designed the track. 

Rihanna's account sessions occurred at Sun Studios in Dublin, Ireland, and were built by Marcos Tovar. The American musician Makeba Riddick gave extra vocal generation. Peculiar utilized adjustment, pressure and resonation however left the vocal equalization. He accepted that Rihanna was happy with her recorded vocals and did not roll out real improvements on her seven stereo vocal tracks. 

"Love the Way You Lie" is a midtempo hip bounce anthem. The verses portray a couple's refusal to isolate in spite of having an oppressive relationship. As indicated by the sheet music from Universal Music Publishing Group, the melody is in the key of G minor with a typical time signature and a rhythm of 84Â beats every moment. The vocal range ranges from B to D. "Love the Way You Lie" opens as Rihanna sings the pop hold back over a piano: 

Just going to remain there and watch me consume 

Yet, that is okay, since I like the manner in which it harms. 

Just going to remain there and hear me cry 

Yet, that is okay, since I adore the manner in which you lie. 

The hold back depends on a Gmâ Eâ Bâ F/A harmony movement. Fraser McAlpine of the BBC composed that Rihanna feels kept "in a cell of [her] claim creation". She sings without vibrato, a throbbing melodic impact used to include articulation. One observer, "The New York Times" David Brownie, composed that in spite of this, her voice unobtrusively demonstrates sadness and lament. Eminem then "zap[s] out into a ballady rap": "I can't disclose to you what it truly is/I can just reveal to you what it feels like." The refrains pursue a Gmâ EBâ Fsus/A harmony movement. Eminem laments a conclusion to an oppressive, fizzled relationship, portraying shared brutality and communicating both affection and outrage. The two specialists' characters are depicted in a sentimental relationship when he reacts to Rihanna by finishing up the refrain: "I laid hands on her. I'll never stoop so low again/I surmise I don't have the foggiest idea about my very own quality." Rihanna sings the tune again, upheld by an electric guitar and a piano. 

Acoustic guitar, violin and drums go with Eminem's refrains. The verses change from talking about positive parts of adoration to portraying fierce occasions. Eminem raps, "the fury dominated, it controls you both, so they say all that needs to be said to go your different ways. Estimate that they don't know ya, cause today that was yesterday." Sady Doyle of "The Atlantic" translated these verses as the rapper's admission to having manhandled Scott, as he "turns the outrage and allegations toward himself". In the second section, Eminem acknowledges the result in the wake of inclination sorry, conceding, "Yesterday is finished, it's an alternate day." His disappointment increments and he raps that two identities can conflict and decimate: "possibly that is the thing that happens when a tornado meets a fountain of liquid magma". The depicted loveâ abhor relationship declines and prompts abusive behavior at home. Eminem confesses to lying about guarantees he makes and says late in the tune, "On the off chance that she ever attempts to fuckin' leave again, I'ma attach her to the bed and set this house ablaze", a reference to Rihanna's verses. 

On May 27, 2010, Eminem uncovered the title of "Adoration the Way You Lie" as a major aspect of the track rundown of his seventh studio collection "Recuperation", which turned out on June 21. At first a radio single, the melody was discharged later by Polydor Records as a CD in the United Kingdom on August 9, 2010. Interscope Records conveyed it in Germany on August 20. 

"Love the Way You Lie" got commonly ideal surveys. An editorial manager for "Rap-Up" recorded it among the four best tracks from the collection. "New York Times" essayist Jon Caramanica thought of it as "one of the collection's most captivating melodies" and commended Eminem's capacity to survey issues from the points of view of both genders. MTV's Rodriguez composed that the melody echoes content from Eminem's prior collections, yet discovers him "calm" and "increasingly develop". He added that the verses imply Eminem's association with Scott and that "Adoration the Way You Lie" is his nearest way to deal with an affection melody. Editors of "The A.V. Club" contrasted the single and "Kim" and 97 Bonnie and Clyde"; they discovered he is increasingly tempered in "Affection the Way You Lie" while talking about a "commonly ruinous relationship" and that Rihanna's association makes a scary mind-set. 

Faultfinders particularly adulated Rihanna's commitment. Michael Menachem of "Announcement" complimented her "dazzlingly melodic and shockingly cheerful" vocal execution and "Eminem's dull, contemplative" rapping. He noticed that the percussion supplements the two craftsmen and that Alex da Kid gave the traditional course of action a standard touch. Kyle Anderson, composing for MTV, commented that the tune exhibits Rihanna's enthusiastic vocals and Eminem's "most extraordinary rhymes about his turbulent connections". He respected "Love the Way You Lie" as a fair, "very much built pop tune with an incredible snare" and compared the "moderate consuming" music to that of "Somebody like You", a 2011 single by the British artist Adele. The "Houston Chronicle" pop faultfinder Joey Guerra remarked that Rihanna brought a "sandpaper and silk sheen" to the track. 

Faultfinders have remarked on the message in the verses. Anderson noticed a dim topic, while Nick Levine of Digital Spy, Allie Townsend of "Time" magazine and Jocelyn Noveck of The Associated Press proposed the past connections of the two craftsmen affected the melody. Levine gave it four stars out of five. As per Eric Hayden of The Atlantic Wire, the melody alludes to a drunkard couple, potentially motivated by Rihanna's association with Brown. McAlphine granted "Love the Way You Lie" four stars out of five. As indicated by him, the melody would not have been compelling in the event that it had included just Eminem's perspective and sentiments of disappointment; he composed that Rihanna's speaking to the contrary side of the relationship demonstrates "appropriate narrating" and "communicates something specific" on account of her separation with Brown. McAlphine composed that thus the melody portrays an increasingly sensible damaging relationship and could be included in a battle for ladies' safe houses. He lauded Eminem's precision and comprehension of the subject. Winston Robbins from "Result of Sound" credited the tune's power to Rihanna's past damaging relationship, and a subject of treachery and misuse. 

On the basic side, "The Daily Telegraph's" Jenny McCartney expelled the allegories in the ensemble and thought the melody's point was over-advertised. She couldn't help contradicting the basic recognition, contending that ladies acknowledge injurious connections for more profound reasons than sexual and enthusiastic delight, for example, family and money related issues and vulnerability. In a NPR article, the author Maura Johnston remarked that the verses depict Rihanna as the subject of Eminem's viciousness. Jay Smooth, a New York radio character, reacted that "while Eminem investigates the mind of the abuser with a practically aggravating measure of profundity and detail," Rihanna's viewpoint is minimized and not clarified completely. Johnston and Smooth composed that such awkward nature are a common issue in prominent music two part harmonies. To Sady Doyle, in spite of the fact that "Adoration the Way You Lie" is a standout amongst Eminem's most influencing tracks and discovers him contrite, it doesn't compensate for his past misanthropic activities and scornful tunes. Noveck addressed whether the verses are "a treatise against (or statement of regret for) abusive behavior at home, or a flippant glorification of it? Or on the other hand, is it something awkward in the middle?" 

Marjorie Gilberg, official chief of the counter high school brutality aggregate Break the Cycle, remarked that "Adoration the Way You Lie" can show audience members the risks of harsh connections if deciphered effectively. She trusted that in light of the fact that mainstream culture frequently portrays what is socially satisfactory, individuals may acknowledge such brutality all the more effectively. She included, "One issue, though,Â ... is that the tune reflects legends about aggressive behavior at homeâfantasies that lead to accusing the person in question." Gilberg said the injured individual is regularly blamed for being as blameworthy as the accomplice however needs to be adored, not manhandled. Terry O'Neill, a women's activist and the leader of the National Organization for Women, scrutinized the verse, "Yet your temper's similarly as awful as mine is/You're equivalent to me", saying it is an ordinary reason utilized by injurious men for hostility and that "it's solitary 2-year-olds and fierce men who use brutality to get what they need." She included that Rihanna inadvertently extols abusive behavior at home in the melody in spite of endeavoring to battle it.

We needed to make a particular anecdote around two individualsâMeg and Domânot a video that was agent everything being equal or all abusive behavior at home circumstances. I'm not saying that all couples battle along these lines. I simply need individuals just to have the capacity to relate to the characters and perceive that they've seen connections like this where two individuals are as one that are totally wrong for one another and things winding out of control.Â ... Megan was the way to this video.Â ... I'll let you know as a chief the motivation behind why [Fox and Monaghan's] scenes in the video feel so genuine is on the grounds that at the time they were genuine. 

Monaghan revealed to MTV he thought the couple speaks to Eminem and Scott. The clasp was delivered by Kathy Angstadt and MaryAnn Tanedo of HSI Productions. In the blink of an eye before its discharge, Eminem revealed in a press articulation: "Joseph and I worked pretty firmly together to ensure we got this right".

The man at that point pushes her onto the divider and points his clench hand at her, puncturing the divider. After Rihanna sings once more, the video flashes back to when the couple initially meet "at a shabby plunge bar nearby" to an alcohol store.
