Attack of Berwick (1333) 

The Siege of Berwick kept going four months in 1333, and brought about the Scottish-held town of Berwick-upon-Tweed (regularly known as Berwick) being caught by an English armed force told by King Edward III (). The prior year, Edward Balliol had caught the Scottish Crown, secretly upheld by Edward III. He was in the blink of an eye removed from the kingdom by a mainstream uprising. Edward III utilized this as a "casus belli" and attacked Scotland. The prompt target was the deliberately imperative bordertown of Berwick. 

A development constrain laid attack to the town in March. Edward III and the fundamental English armed force went along with it in May and squeezed the assault. A vast Scottish armed force progressed to soothe the town. After fruitlessly moving for position and realizing that Berwick was very nearly surrender, the Scots felt constrained to assault the English at Halidon Hill on 19 July. They endured a devastating thrashing and Berwick surrendered on terms the following day. Balliol was reinstalled as King of Scotland subsequent to surrendering a huge piece of his region to Edward III and consenting to do respect for the parity. 

The First War of Scottish Independence among England and Scotland started in March 1296, when Edward I of England () raged and sacked the Scottish bordertown of Berwick as a prelude to his attack of Scotland. Following 30 years of fighting that pursued, the recently delegated 14-year-old King Edward III was almost caught in the English calamity at Stanhope Park. This brought his officials, Isabella and Roger Mortimer, to the arranging table. They consented to the Treaty of Northampton with Robert Bruce () in 1328 however this settlement was broadly disliked in England and regularly known as "turpis pax", "the quitters' tranquility". A few Scots nobles, declining to swear fealty to Bruce, were excluded and left Scotland to unite with Edward Balliol, child of King John I of Scotland (), whom Edward I had removed in 1296. 

Robert Bruce passed on in 1329; his beneficiary was 5-year-old David II (). In 1331, under the authority of Edward Balliol and Henry Beaumont, fourth Earl of Buchan, the excluded Scottish nobles assembled in Yorkshire and plotted an intrusion of Scotland. Edward III knew about the plan and formally precluded it, in March 1332 composition to his northern authorities that anybody arranging an attack of Scotland was to be captured. The truth was unique, Edward III being glad to cause inconvenience for his northern neighbor. He demanded that Balliol not attack Scotland overland from England but rather deliberately ignored to his powers cruising for Scotland from Yorkshire ports on 31 July 1332. The Scots knew about the circumstance and were hanging tight for Balliol. David II's official was an accomplished old officer, Thomas Randolph, first Earl of Moray. He had arranged for Balliol and Beaumont, however he passed on ten days before they cruised. 

Five days in the wake of arriving in Fife, Balliol's power of somewhere in the range of 2,000 men met the Scottish armed force of 12,000â 15,000 men. The Scots were smashed at the Battle of Dupplin Moor. A large number of Scots kicked the bucket, including a significant part of the respectability of the domain. Balliol was delegated King of Scotland at Sconethe customary spot of crowning ceremony for Scottish monarchson 24 September 1332. Very quickly, Balliol allowed Edward III Scottish bequests to an estimation of Â£2,000, which notwithstanding "the town, mansion and region of Berwick". Balliol's help inside Scotland was constrained and inside a half year it had crumpled. He was trapped by supporters of David II at the Battle of Annan a couple of months after his crowning ceremony. Balliol fled to England half-dressed and riding without any protection. He spoke to Edward III for help. 

Berwick, on the North Sea shore of Britain, is on the Anglo-Scottish outskirt, with on leg on each side of the principle attack and exchange course in either bearing. In the Middle Ages, it was the entryway from Scotland to the English eastern walk. As per William Edington, a priest and chancellor of England, Berwick was "so crowded and of such business significance that it may appropriately be called another Alexandria, whose wealth were the ocean and the water its dividers". It was the best exchanging town in Scotland, and the obligation on fleece which went through it was the Scottish Crown's biggest single wellspring of salary. Amid hundreds of years of war between the two countries its key esteem and relative riches prompted a progression of attacks, attacks and takeovers. Fights were uncommon, as the Scots favored guerrilla strategies and fringe assaulting into England. Berwick had been sold to the Scots by Richard I of England () 140 years prior, to raise assets for his campaign. The town was caught and sacked by Edward I in 1296, the primary noteworthy activity of the First War of Scottish Independence. Twenty after two years Robert Bruce retook it in the wake of influencing an English watchman, ousting the last English battalion from Scottish soil. Lord Edward II of England () endeavored to recover Berwick in 1319 yet relinquished the attack after a Scottish armed force circumvent him and vanquished a hurriedly amassed armed force under the Archbishop of York at the Battle of Myton. 

Toward the start of 1333, the air on the outskirt was tense; Edward III had dropped all falsification of impartiality, perceived Balliol as King of Scotland and was making prepared for war. The English parliament met at York and discussed the circumstance for five days without end. Edward III guaranteed to examine the issue with both Pope John XXII and King Philip VI of France (). Perhaps to keep the Scots from stepping up to the plate, England started transparently getting ready for war, while declaring that it was Scotland which was planning to attack England. In Scotland Archibald Douglas was Guardian of the Realm for the underage David. He was the sibling of the "Great" Sir James Douglas, a saint of the First War of Independence. Weapons and supplies were assembled as he made courses of action for the guard of Berwick. Patrick Dunbar, Earl of March, the Keeper of Berwick Castle, had as of late spent about Â£200 on its resistances. Sir Alexander Seton was named Governor of Berwick, in charge of the protection of the town. After it was sacked in 1296, Edward I had supplanted the old wooden palisade with stone dividers. These were impressively improved by the Scots in 1318. The dividers extended for and were up to thick and high. They were secured by towers, each up to tall. The divider toward the south-west was additionally ensured by the River Tweed, which was crossed by a stone extension and entered the town at a stone gatehouse. Berwick Castle was toward the west of the town, isolated by an expansive channel, making the town and palace autonomous fortresses. Berwick was very much safeguarded, all around loaded with arrangements and materiel, and expected to withstand a long attack. 

Balliol, in order of the excluded Scottish masters and some English magnates, crossed the fringe on 10 March. Edward III made gifts of over Â£1,000 to the nobles going with him on the crusade and a comparative sum was paid to Balliol's mates; Balliol got over Â£700 by and by. He walked through Roxburghshire, consuming and plundering as he proceeded to catch Oxnam. He came to Berwick in late March and cut it off via land. Edward III's naval force had officially secluded it via ocean. Balliol and the nobles going with him are said to have sworn not to pull back until Berwick had fallen. Edward touched base at Berwick with the primary English armed force on 9May, in the wake of leaving Queen Philippa at Bamburgh Castle south of Berwick. Balliol had been at Berwick for about a month and a half and had put the town under close attack. Channels had been burrowed, the water supply cut and all correspondence with the hinterland averted. A singed earth strategy was connected to the encompassing territory to deny supplies for the town if a chance to break the attack happened. The looting of the field additionally added to the English armed force's provisions. The military included troops brought up in the Welsh Marches and the Midlands, just as duties from the north which had just gathered because of the prior Scottish attacks. Before the month's over, this power had been expanded by honorable entourages, a gather at Newcastle, and the get together of the English armada in the River Tyne. Going with the military were skilled workers to assemble attack motors. Thirty-seven artisans arranged almost 700 stone rockets for the attack, which were transported via ocean from Hull on 16 May.Edward III Had orchestrated the joined armed force to be revictualled via ocean through the little port of Tweedmouth. 

Douglas had gathered a huge armed force north of the outskirt yet his idleness stands out pointedly from Robert Bruce's quick reaction to the attack of 1319. Douglas appears to have invested the energy amassing always troops, as opposed to utilizing those he previously needed to mount diversionary attacks. 

Minor strikes into Cumberland were propelled by Sir Archibald Douglas. These were inadequate to draw the English powers from the attack. Be that as it may, it gave Edward III an appearance for his intrusion, of which he exploited. The accomplishment of Edward III's publicity is reflected in contemporaneous English accounts, which depict his intrusion as striking back against Scottish invasions, 

With the entry of Edward III, the attack on Berwick started. It was told by the Flemish officer trader John Crabb. Crabb had protected Berwick from the English in 1319, been caught by them in 1332 and now utilized his insight into Berwick's barriers for England's sake. Launches and trebuchets were utilized to incredible impact. The English utilized some type of guns amid the attack and present day student of history Ranald Nicholson states that Berwick was most likely "the principal town in the British Isles to be assaulted by gun". 

In late June, the safeguards set afloat consuming brushwood absorbed tar, trying to repulse a maritime strike. Rather than the English boats, a significant part of the town was determined to flame. William Seton, a child of the town's senator, was executed battling an English seabourne strike. Before the finish of June the assaults via land and ocean had conveyed the town to a condition of ruin and the army near depletion. It is trusted that a longing for a relief from the diving flame of the two expansive stabilizer trebuchets utilized by the English was a critical factor in Seton mentioning a short ceasefire from King Edward. This was in truth, yet just depending on the prerequisite that he surrender if not eased by 11 July. Seton's child, Thomas, was to be a prisoner to the understanding, alongside eleven others. 

Douglas was currently looked with a circumstance like what the English had looked before the Battle of Bannockburn. Present day history specialist Ranald Nicholson thinks about that "If Berwick somehow happened to be spared prompt activity with respect to the Scottish gatekeeper was unavoidable". As an issue of national pride Douglas would need to go to the help of Berwick, similarly as Edward II had gone to the alleviation of Stirling Castle in 1314. The military that Douglas had invested so much energy gathering was currently constrained to take to the field. The English armed force is assessed to have been under 10,000 in number â dwarfed around two-to-one by the Scots. Douglas entered England on 11July, the most recent day of Seton's ceasefire. He propelled eastwards to Tweedmouth and crushed it in sight of the English armed force. Edward III did not move. 

Sir William Keith, with Sir Alexander Gray and Sir William Prenderguest, lead a power of around 200 Scottish rangers. With some trouble, they constrained their way over the remnants of the scaffold toward the northern bank of the Tweed and advanced into the town. Douglas considered the town calmed. He sent messages to Edward III approaching him to leave, undermining that in the event that he neglected to do as such, the Scots armed force would destroy England. The Scots were tested to do their most exceedingly bad. The safeguards contended that Keith's 200 horsemen comprised the alleviation as indicated by the ceasefire and subsequently they didn't need to surrender. Edward III expressed this was not the situation: they must be alleviated legitimately from Scotlandliterally from the heading of Scotlandwhereas Keith, Gray and Prenderguest had drawn closer Berwick from the bearing of England. Edward III decided that the ceasefire understanding had been broken â the town having neither surrendered nor been mitigated. A hangman's tree was built legitimately outside the town dividers and, as the most astounding positioning prisoner, Thomas Seton was hanged while his folks viewed. Edward III issued directions that every day the town neglected to surrender, another two prisoners ought to be hanged. 

Keith, having assumed responsibility for the town from Seton, finished up a new dÃ©tente on 15 July, encouraging to surrender if not mitigated by dusk on 19July. The ceasefire involved two arrangements, one between Edward III and the town of Berwick and the other between Edward III and March, the Keeper of Berwick Castle. It characterized conditions in which alleviation would or would not happen. The terms of surrender were not unlimited. The town was to be come back to English soil and law however the occupants were to be permitted to leave, with their products and assets, under a protected direct from Edward III. All individuals from the battalion would likewise be sans given section. Alleviation was characterized as one of three occasions: 200 Scottish men-at-arms battling their way into Berwick; the Scottish armed force compelling its way over a particular stretch of the River Tweed; or, it vanquishing the English armed force in open fight on Scottish soil. On finishing up the new settlement, Keith was permitted to quickly leave Berwick, travel to wherever the Guardian of Scotland happened to be, instruct him with respect to the terms of the bargain, and return securely to Berwick. 

At this point Douglas had walked south to Bamburgh, maybe seeking after a rehash of the occasions of 1319, when Edward II had severed an attack of Berwick after a Scottish armed force had progressed on York, where his ruler was staying, and crushed Yorkshire. Whatever worries Edward III had for his ruler, he realized that Bamburgh could without much of a stretch withstand an attack. The Scots did not have room schedule-wise to develop the sort of hardware that would be important to take the post by strike. The Scots crushed the wide open yet Edward III overlooked this. He situated the English armed force on Halidon Hill, a little ascent of some , 2 miles toward the north west of Berwick, which gives a great perspective on the town and the region. From this vantage point, he commanded the intersection of the Tweed determined in the agreements and would have had the capacity to assault the flank of any power of men-at-arms endeavoring to enter Berwick. Getting Keith's news, Douglas felt that his solitary choice was to draw in the English in fight. Intersection the Tweed toward the west of the English position, the Scottish armed force achieved the town of Duns, 15 miles from Berwick, on 18July. On the next day it drew closer Halidon Hill from the north west, prepared to give fight on ground picked by Edward III. Edward III needed to confront a Scottish armed force to the front and gatekeeper his back against the danger of a foray by the battalion of Berwick; by certain records an extensive extent of the English armed force was left guarding Berwick. 

To draw in the English, the Scots needed to propel downhill, cross a huge territory of mucky ground and afterward climb the northern slant of Halidon Hill. The Battle of Dupplin Moor the earlier year had appeared powerless the Scots were to bolts. The judicious strategy would have been to pull back and trust that a superior open door will battle, however this would ensure the loss of Berwick. The militaries experienced each other's scouts around late morning on 19July. Douglas requested an assault. The "Lanercost Chronicle" reports: The Scots endured numerous setbacks and the lower scopes of the slope were covered with dead and injured. The survivors proceeded upwards, through the bolts "as thick as bits in a sun shaft", as per an anonymous contemporary cited by Nicholson, and on to the holding up lances. 

The Scottish armed force broke, the camp devotees snatched the ponies and the escapees were sought after by the mounted English knights. Their losses were numbered in thousands, including Douglas and five lords dead on the field. Scots who surrendered were executed on Edward's requests and some suffocated as they fled into the ocean. English losses were accounted for as fourteen; a few annals give a lower figure of seven. Around a hundred Scots who had been taken prisoner were executed the following morning, 20July. This was the date that Berwick's second dÃ©tente terminated, and the town and the manor surrendered on the terms in the agreements. 

After the capitulation of Berwick, Edward III selected Henry de Percy, second Baron Percy as Constable, with Sir Thomas Gray of Heaton, father of the writer Thomas Gray, as his agent. Considering his part done and shy of cash, he left for the south. On 19June 1334, Balliol did tribute to Edward for Scotland, after formally surrendering to England the eight areas of south-east Scotland. Balliol ruled a truncated Scottish state from Perth, from where he endeavored to put down the rest of the obstruction. Seton thusly did praise to Balliol. Balliol was dismissed again in 1334, reestablished again in 1335 lastly removed in 1336, by those faithful to David II. Berwick was to remain the military and political central station of the English on the fringe until 1461, when it was come back to the Scottish by King Henry VI (). Clifford Rogers expresses that Berwick "remained a bone of dispute all through the Middle Ages", until its last re-catch for the English by Richard, Duke of Gloucester, the future Richard III, in 1482.
