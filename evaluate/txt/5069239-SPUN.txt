Amid the first playthrough, if Class Zero acknowledges the offer, they go into fight against the Rursus and bite the dust, damning Orience to be pulverized in Tempus Finis and renewed in another winding of history. 

Class Zero deny the Crystal's offer and Rem is made a l'Cie in their place. Machina and Rem end up battling each other in Pandaemonium: Rem is mortally injured, and she and Machina swing to gem. Seriously debilitated by the preliminaries and disheartened at seeing Machina and Rem's condition, Class Zero are at first unfit to crush the Arbiter.

"Last Fantasy Type-0" was initially titled "Last Fantasy Agito XIII", imagined as a diversion for cell phones. It was imagined in 2005 as a major aspect of "Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy", a subseries of "Conclusive Fantasy" amusements connected by a typical mythos. "Agito XIII" was the last unique "Fabula Nova Crystallis" amusement to be made. The choice to make it a versatile diversion depended on the prominence of "". Hajime Tabata, who added to the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" mythos, was hunting down another undertaking in the wake of completing "Before Crisis" and turned into the amusement's executive. "Prior to Crisis" maker Kosei Ito went about as maker before his turn to Capcom preceding 2009. Starting improvement in 2006, it was first declared at that year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). It was said to offer in a hurry access to the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" universe, utilizing ongoing interaction capacities restrictive to cell phones of the time. The idea was to convey a diversion for portable stages proportionate to a reassure amusement from the fundamental "Last Fantasy" arrangement, and to make it accessible completely upon discharge instead of in long winded organization. 

Engineers had been arranging a discharge on the up and coming age of cell phones, as those accessible at the time couldn't offer every one of the abilities they would require. While it was initially professed to be a versatile select, variants for the two mobiles and the PlayStation Portable were being created, with the last to be uncovered when the previous was adequately best in class. The first staff individuals were Tabata, Yusuke Naora and Tetsuya Nomura. Nomura went about as a character fashioner and imaginative maker. Somewhere in the range of 2006 and 2008, advancement faltered among inertia and drowsiness since a large portion of the group was committed to "". In 2008, it was said to confront significant issues because of the size of the venture. An issue engineers had pondered was whether to make the direction catches utilized in the diversion obvious on the portable screen. "Agito XIII" was depicted as an online RPG utilizing completely rendered 3D illustrations like comfort amusements, just as having interactivity components from different classifications, for example, MMORPGs, littler scale multiplayer-centered recreations, and standard pretending diversions. Other incomplete ideas being created were multi day-night cycle, a schedule framework connected to certifiable time and dates, and a story affected by player cast a ballot. 

In 2008, it was chosen to make "Type-0" a PSP elite, dropping the portable form of the diversion as the designers did not have any desire to trust that versatile innovation will achieve a dimension which could deal with their full vision for the amusement. Full improvement started that year by a similar group who created "Emergency Core", however was again moderated as a large portion of them were finishing chip away at "The third Birthday". In view of these clashing undertakings, "Type-0" verged on being dropped inside and out. Somewhere in the range of 2009 and 2011, the title was changed to separate it from "Conclusive Fantasy XIII", since after the stage change the two amusements shared little for all intents and purpose other than their common mythos. One of the titles considered and dismissed was "Last Fantasy Live", alluding to the diversion's multiplayer component. The new title, "Last Fantasy Type-0," was expected to demonstrate the amusement's partition from the fundamental arrangement. It was likewise the start of an elective numbering framework parallel to the principle arrangement. The diversion showed up under the new title at the Square Enix first Production Department Premier in Tokyo, alongside another trailer that was discharged to people in general on January 27, 2011. 

"Type-0"s situation was brought about by Tabata and composed by Hiroki Chiba and Sarah Okabe. While the amusement was as yet titled "Agito XIII", Tabata portrayed it as "a noteworthy title [...] shaped from an assortment of ideas" which incorporated the crash of four dreams (the diversion's perspective on Orience), a fight among enchantment and weapons, and the opposite sides of the real world. The early story idea drew vigorously from prevalent manga and anime, however little made due after the stage change. Tabata rather picked another style like verifiable movies and documentaries. The new story's idea began with the possibility of a war story told by youngsters got up to speed in the occasion, with its story topics rotating around death and its effect on others. A noteworthy motivation was the Japanese narrative arrangement "Hundreds of years of Picture". The last story was darker than numerous other "Last Fantasy" diversions. Regardless of its title change, the amusement was kept inside the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" mythos. The methodology taken with the mythos was to depict the jobs of its divinities from an authentic point of view, while recounting to a story concentrated on the human side of occasions. The cyclic idea of the diversion's universe was made to help fuse parts of the mythos. The jobs and foundations for each character in the amusement were considered and set up after the setting and principle story had been finished. After the amusement's discharge, Tabata remarked that when he was composing the story he would have jumped at the chance to have been increasingly intensive, and to have made the story simpler for players to get it. 

The diversion's logo fine art was drawn by customary arrangement craftsman Yoshitaka Amano. The kanji image utilized in the logo was drawn by Naora, who had structured the Shinra logo in "Conclusive Fantasy VII" and its friend media. Naora explicitly mentioned that he attract the logo because of this past experience. To accomplish the grittier air, Naora took an exploration excursion to a Japanese military camp to realize what being a military cadet resembled. The island of the Vermillion Perystilium depended on a seaward Japanese island he had visited preceding his contribution with the amusement, including components in-diversion, for example, a seaward ship wreck to symbolize his dread of the ocean. He was additionally affected by an occurrence where he saw a dead feline encompassed by different felines to depict the bond between individuals from Class Zero, and the diversion's subjects, in special work of art. 

The ongoing interaction was propelled by the multi-character arrangement of "Before Crisis", while the naming of enchantment styles after weapons of war made reference to first-individual shooters. The battle was intended to be loaded up with strain and depict each playable character's identity on the front line. The Eidolons were initially not controlled in realtime, yet amid the improvement of Ifrit, Tabata did some testing with continuous directions. The outcomes inspired him enough that he chose to defeat the specialized troubles included and make the Eidolons controllable. Because of specialized limitations and the nearness of the Academy Assist work, the diversion's man-made brainpower for playable characters should have been restricted to recuperating, survival and other minor activities. The diversion's multiplayer was intentionally planned around limited portions. Its advancement was all the while progressing amid the late spring of 2011, with an impermanent stoppage of PlayStation Network that year contrarily influencing its improvement. As a result of the measure of the task, investigating the amusement took far longer than foreseen. Between the arrival of the demo and the full diversion, changes were made to interactivity mechanics and the in-amusement camera. In a post-discharge talk with, Tabata remarked that he would have gotten a kick out of the chance to grow the multiplayer capacities to incorporate a specially appointed capacity and extended helpful ongoing interaction, and make an all the more sympathetic expectation to absorb information for players. 

The music for "Type-0" was created by Takeharu Ishimoto. He had recently made the music for "Before Crisis", "Emergency Core" and "The World Ends with You". Ishimoto gave the music a dull and substantial feel, portraying the topics as "war, life, and passing". He utilized less shake components than in his past diversions to advance a sentiment of submersion. One of his essential instruments was simply the guitar, which Ishimoto played amid chronicle sessions. In spite of the fact that the title was for the PSP, the group did not have any desire to keep down regardless of equipment impediments, recording an amount of tracks uncommon for a turn off "Definite Fantasy" title. Wherever conceivable, the chronicle was done live. The instrumental and choral components were performed by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and the Cantillation chamber choir, and the chronicle and blending of these tracks was done at the Sydney Opera House. Recording for different tracks was done at Ishimoto's studio in Japan. In the wake of chronicle, Ishimoto joined the instrumental and choral components, and adjusted the primary leitmotifs to make more assortment in the score. Game plans for the symphonic tunes were finished by Kentaro Sato, while courses of action for different tracks were finished by Rieko Mikoshiba. 

The diversion's signature tune, "Zero", was formed and performed by Japanese musical gang Bump of Chicken. The band, which was a major enthusiast of the "Last Fantasy" arrangement, was reached by Square Enix to form and play out the melody and concurred promptly. It was gotten after the stage move onto the PSP, yet while the amusement was as yet titled "Agito XIII". While searching for motivation, the band had the capacity to find being developed screen captures of the diversion, tests of the content, and character outlines. The band was for the most part given a free hand while forming the tune. Its one rule was given by Tabata, who proposed the signature tune for a considerable length of time "of Picture", "Is Paris Burning?" by Takeshi Kako, as a wellspring of motivation. Various renditions of "Zero" were created for use in various territories of the amusement. In line with band pioneer Motoo Fujiwara, Amano's logo craftsmanship was utilized for the front of the single's constrained version.
