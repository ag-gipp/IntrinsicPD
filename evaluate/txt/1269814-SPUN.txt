Japanese plane carrying warship Jun'yÅ 

"Jun'yÅ" was torpedoed in November 1943 and went through three months under fix. She was harmed by a few bombs amid the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944, yet immediately came back to support. Lacking air ship, she was utilized as a vehicle in late 1944 and was torpedoed again in December. "Jun'yÅ" was under fix until March 1945, when work was dropped as uneconomical. She was then successfully hulked for the remainder of the war. After the surrender of Japan in September, the Americans likewise concluded that she was not worth the expense to make her useful for use as a repatriation ship, and she was separated in 1946â 1947. 

The ship was requested in late 1938 as the quick extravagance traveler liner "Kashiwara Maru" by "Nippon Yusen Kaisha" (the Japan Mail Steamship Company). In return for a 60 percent sponsorship of her structure costs by the Navy Ministry, she was intended to be changed over to an assistant plane carrying warship, one of 10 such ships financed by the IJN. 

"Jun'yÅ" had a general length of , a light emission a draft of . She uprooted at standard burden. Her group extended from 1,187 to 1,224 officers and men. The ship was fitted with two Mitsubishi-Curtis adapted steam turbine sets with an aggregate of , each driving one propeller shaft, utilizing steam given by six Mitsubishi three-drum water-tube boilers. "Jun'yÅ" had a planned speed of , however came to amid her ocean preliminaries. The ship conveyed of fuel oil, which gave her a scope of at . 

"Jun'yÅ"s flight deck was long and had a most extreme width of . The ship was planned with two superimposed shelters, each around long, wide and high. Every storage could be subdivided by four flame blinds and they were fitted with putting out fires froth distributors on each side. The storages were served by two air ship lifts. 

The ship's air aggregate was initially planned to comprise of 12 Mitsubishi A5M ("Claude") warriors, in addition to 4 away, 18 Aichi D3A "Val" plunge aircraft, in addition to 2 available for later, and 18 Nakajima B5N "Kate" torpedo planes. This was reexamined to substitute twelve Mitsubishi A6M Zero contenders, together with 3 more away, for the A5Ms when the ship authorized in 1942. Because of the exercises gained from the Battle of Midway in June, the ship's contender supplement was reinforced to 21 Zeros, and the other flying machine diminished to 12 D3As and 9 B5Ns. Before the year's over, 6 additional Zeros supplanted an equivalent number of D3As. Despite the fact that it was conceivable to fit all these air ship into the storages, 8 or 9 were generally put away on the flight deck to decrease cramping underneath decks. 

As a change from a sea liner, the ship couldn't bolster much protective layer, in spite of the fact that it had a twofold base. Two plates of Ducol steel, every thick, secured the sides of the ship's hardware spaces. The ship's flight gas tanks and magazines were ensured by one layer of Ducol steel. Her apparatus spaces were additionally subdivided by transverse and longitudinal bulkheads to restrain any flooding. 

The ship's essential weapon comprised of twelve 40-gauge Type 89 against flying machine (AA) firearms in six twin-weapon mounts on sponsons at the edges of the frame. "Jun'yÅ" was likewise at first furnished with eight triple mounts for 25Â mm Type 96 light AA weapons nearby the flight deck. In mid-1943, four progressively triple mounts were included and another four triple mounts in late 1943 and mid 1944. Two of these last four mounts were mounted on the stern and the others were put before and behind the island. Twelve single mounts were additionally included, some of which were compact and could be mounted on the flight deck. After the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, the ship's enemy of air ship combat hardware was strengthened with three increasingly triple mounts, two twin mounts and eighteen single mounts for the 25Â mm Type 96 weapon. These firearms were enhanced by six 28-round AA rocket launchers. In October 1944, "Jun'yÅ" had a sum of 91 Type 96 firearms: 57 of every nineteen triple mounts, 4 of every two twin mounts, and 30 single mounts. 

Two Type 94 high-edge shoot control executives, one on each side of the ship, were fitted to control the Type 89 firearms. Every chief mounted a rangefinder. Whenever "Jun'yÅ" was first charged just the rangefinders were fitted and the chiefs were included later. Four Type 95 executives controlled the 25Â mm firearms and another pair were included mid 1943. Early cautioning was given by two Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 early-cautioning radars. The first of these was mounted on the highest point of the island in July 1942, not long after she was finished, and the other was included later in the year the port side of the body, detachable of the back lift. A littler Type 3, Mark 1, Model 3 early-cautioning radar was included 1944. 

"Jun'yÅ"s bottom was set somewhere near Mitsubishi on Slipway No. 3 at their shipyard in Nagasaki on 20 March 1939. She was yard number 900 and had the name "Kashiwara Maru" around then. The ship was bought on 10 February 1941 by the Navy Ministry and she was briefly alluded to as No. 1001 Ship ("Dai 1001 bankan") to keep her change mystery. She was propelled on 26 June 1941 and appointed on 3 May 1942 as "Jun'yÅ". 

After dispatching, the ship was relegated to the Fourth Carrier Division of the first Air Fleet, together with , under the direction of Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta. She was entrusted to help Operation AL, an assault intended to catch a few Aleutian Islands to give preemptive guidance if there should arise an occurrence of an American assault starting from the aleutians the Kurile Islands while the primary body of the American armada was involved protecting Midway. "Jun'yÅ" conveyed 18 A6M2 Zeros and 18 D3As for this task. At sunrise on 3 June, she propelled 9 Zeros and twelve D3As to assault Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. They needed to turn back because of awful climate, despite the fact that an American PBY Catalina surveillance air ship was shot somewhere near a Zero. A second airstrike was propelled later in the day to assault a gathering of destroyers found via airplane from the main assault, yet they neglected to discover the objectives. Another airstrike was propelled on the next day by the two transporters that comprised of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and effectively besieged Dutch Harbor. As the flying machine from "Jun'yÅ" were regrouping after the assault, they were assaulted by 8 Curtiss P-40 contenders that shot down 2 Zeros and a couple of D3As while losing 2 of their own. Another D3A got lost and neglected to make it back to the transporter. Soon after the airplane were propelled, the Americans assaulted the transporters, however neglected to perpetrate any harm. A Martin B-26 Marauder plane and a PBY were shot somewhere around Zeros, and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft was shot somewhere around fire amid the assault. 

"Jun'yÅ" had at first been assigned as a helper plane carrying warship ("Tokusetsu kokubokan"), yet following the loss of four Japanese armada transporters in the Battle of Midway, she was redesignated as a standard bearer ("Kokubokan") in July. Skipper Okada Tametsugu expected direction on 20 July 1942. Upon landing in Truk on 9 October, together with her sister send , the ship was doled out to the Second Carrier Division to start activities against American powers in the Guadalcanal territory as a component of the third Fleet. 

The evening of 16 October, the two bearers were requested to assault the American transports off Lunga Point, Guadalcanal and they moved south to their starting point north of Lunga. At 05:15 each ship propelled nine each A6M Zeros and B5Ns (one of "Jun'yÅ"s B5Ns was compelled to turn back with mechanical issues) which achieved the objective and found two destroyers shelling Japanese supply dumps on Guadalcanal around 07:20. "HiyÅ"s air ship assaulted seven minutes after the fact without impact, despite the fact that the American ship shot down one B5N and harmed another which was compelled to make an accident arrival. "Jun'yÅ"s eight B5Ns connected with and furthermore neglected to hit their objective, not least since they were assaulted by Marine Grumman F4F Wildcat contenders at 07:32. The Marine pilots shot down three B5Ns on their first pass and seriously harmed another pair which were additionally compelled to crash land. They at that point shot down the three outstanding aircraft after they missed "Lardner". The protecting Zeros were just ready to shoot down one Wildcat at the expense of one of "HiyÅ"s contenders compelled to crash land, in spite of the fact that they professed to have shot down thirteen Marine warriors. "HiyÅ" was compelled to leave the zone after a flame decreased her top speed to and exchanged three Zeros, one D3A and five B5Ns before she left. Back Admiral Kakuji Kakuta, authority of the Second Carrier Division, additionally exchanged and lifted his banner on board "Jun'yÅ". 

In late October 1942, amid the Guadalcanal Campaign, "Jun'yÅ" participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. Right now, her air aggregate comprised of eighteen Zeros, eighteen D3As and nine B5Ns. At 05:00 on 26 October 1942, she had propelled fourteen Zeros and a couple D3As to arrive at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, which had been erroneously revealed by the Imperial Japanese Army as in their grasp, however they were welcomed by Marine Grumman F4F Wildcats and all were shot down. At 09:30, "Jun'yÅ" propelled another air strike that assaulted the bearer , the warship and the light cruiser , scoring hits on the last two, yet exacting minimal generous harm. Three D3As and a B5N were shot somewhere near returning Douglas SBD Dauntless plunge planes. Kakuta requested another air strike to be propelled at 14:15, utilizing six B5Ns from the harmed and nine D3As from the two transporters. In no time a while later, more air ship were propelled to assault the American boats, including six B5Ns and six D3As escorted by about six Zeros. These air ship assaulted the transporter , which had been seriously harmed by the assaults before in the day. American harm control measures had been somewhat fruitful, yet one torpedo hit by a B5N from "ShÅkaku" expanded her rundown from 7.5Â° to 14.5Â° and close misses by the plunge planes began enough creases in her plating that her rundown expanded to 18Â°. The Americans at long last arranged the ship deserted and the last rush of jump planes hit "Hornet" twice more, yet exacted minimal further harm. 

In mid-November 1942, "Jun'yÅ" was entrusted to give air spread to the caravan expediting fortifications for the Japanese powers Guadalcanal amid the three-day-long Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The ship had twenty-seven A6M3 Zeros, twelve D3A2s and nine B5N2s for this undertaking. Six of her Zeros were on Combat Air Patrol when the guard was found by two SBDs from "Big business" and shot down one plunge aircraft after it had made its spot report. They were unfit to secure the escort against further assaults via airplane based at Henderson Field; seven transports were sunk and the staying four transports were harmed before the day's end. That evening, "Endeavor" had been found by a looking B5N and "Junyo" propelled an air hit with her outstanding air ship, however they neglected to find the American transporter. In December 1942 and January 1943, the transporter secured a few caravans that conveyed fortifications to Wewak, New Guinea, and her air gather ensured the powers there for a few days before coming back to Truk on 20 January. The ship at that point secured the clearing from Guadalcanal through early February. 

"Jun'yÅ" quickly came back to Japan in February before she cruised for Truk on 22 March together with "HiyÅ". Her air amass was separated to Rabaul on 2 April to take part in Operation I-Go, a land-based aeronautical hostile against Allied bases in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. Before coming back to Truk amidst the month, "Jun'yÅ"s air ship professed to have shot down sixteen American flying machine for the loss of seven A6Ms and two D3As, and they sank the destroyer . The ship's air amass was conveyed to Buin, Papua New Guinea, on 2 July in light of the American assault on Rendova Island on 30 June. Her warriors asserted 37 triumphs for the loss of nine flying machine before disbanding on 1 September. Abandoning her flying machine, the bearer came back to Japan in late July. 

"Jun'yÅ" carried air ship to Sumatra in mid-August and troops and hardware to the Caroline Islands in September and October. On the way from Truk to Kure on 5 November 1943, "Jun'yÅ" was hit off Bungo SuidÅ by a torpedo from the submarine . Four men were murdered, yet the harm was light, other than the crippled rudder. The ship was under fix and refit until 29 February 1944 at Kure. In the mean time, her air gather had been reconstituted at Singapore on 1 November with 24 Zeros, 18 D3As and 9 B5Ns. The flying machine exchanged to Truk on 1 December and afterward to Kavieng toward the finish of December before coming to Rabaul on 25 January 1944. Her contenders guaranteed 40 Allied flying machine shot down and another 30 most likely crushed, yet the air assemble was for all intents and purposes demolished. The survivors were back at Truk on 20 February and the air bunch was disbanded. 

Meanwhile, the Japanese Navy had rebuilt its transporter air gatherings so one air bunch was relegated to one bearer division, and the 652nd Naval Air Group was doled out to the second Carrier Division with "HiyÅ", "Jun'yÅ" and "RyÅ«hÅ" on 1 March. The air bunch was rearward in need to be reconstructed and just had 30 Model 21 Zeros, 13 Model 52 Zeros and four D3As close by on 1 April of its approved 81 contenders, 36 jump planes and 27 torpedo aircraft. The ship directed preparing for her airplane in the Inland Sea until 11 May, when she cruised for Tawi-Tawi in the Philippines. The new base was nearer to the oil wells in Borneo on which the Navy depended and furthermore to the Palau and western Caroline Islands, where the Japanese anticipated the following American assault. Nonetheless, the area came up short on a landing strip on which to prepare the green pilots, and American submarine action confined the boats to the dock. 

The Japanese armada was in transit to Guimares Island in the focal Philippines on 13 June, where they expected to rehearse transporter tasks in a territory better shielded from submarines, when Vice Admiral JisaburÅ Ozawa scholarly of the American assault on the Mariana Islands the earlier day. After coming to Guimares, the armada refueled and sortied into the Philippine Sea, where they spotted Task Force 58 on 18 June. The Americans neglected to find Ozawa's ships that day and the Japanese swung south to keep up a consistent separation among them and the American bearers as Ozawa had settled on propelling his air strikes promptly the next morning. Right now, the 652nd Naval Air Group comprised of 81 Zeros, 27 D3As, 9 Yokosuka D4Y "Judy" jump aircraft and 18 Nakajima B6N "Jill" torpedo planes, generally equally isolated among the three boats. The three transporters started propelling their first air strike of 26 bomb-conveying A6M2 Zeros, 16 A6M5 Zeros to escort the other air ship and 7 B6Ns at about 09:30. The vast majority of these air ship were misled and neglected to locate any American boats, in spite of the fact that twelve continued in their pursuit and discovered one of the American undertaking gatherings. A B6N, 5 bomb-conveying Zeros and an escorting Zero were shot somewhere around the guarding warriors and no harm was incurred on any American boats. 

A second air strike of 27 D3As, 9 D4Ys, 2 B6Ns and 26 escorting Zeros was propelled around 11:00, joined by something like 18 A6Ms and B6Ns from "ShÅkaku" and . They had likewise been given a mistaken spot report and couldn't locate any American boats. The 652nd flying machine set out toward landing strip at Rota and Guam to refuel while those from the other two transporters came back to them. A couple of Zeros and 6 D4Ys headed for Rota detected the transporters and on the way, yet neglected to incur any harm on the American boats while losing 5 D4Ys to hostile to flying machine fire. Radar had detected those flying machine set out toward Guam and they were caught by 41 Grumman F6F Hellcats. Just a solitary A6M5, 1 D4Y and 7 D3As of the 49 Japanese flying machine endure the experience and landed. 

At sunset, the Japanese dismissed toward the northwest to regroup and to refuel and the Americans swung west to close the separation. They found the resigning Japanese armada amid the evening of the next day and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher requested an air strike propelled. They found the boats of the Second Carrier Division and hit "Jun'yÅ" with two bombs close to her island. The ship was not gravely harmed, however flight activities must be suspended. The 652nd Naval Air Group guaranteed seven American flying machine shot down and four all the more most likely shot down, yet lost eleven Zeros, or more another three that needed to jettison. The air amass was disbanded on 10 July with a large number of its outstanding work force being doled out to Air Group 653. 

After fixes at Kure, "Jun'yÅ" stayed in the Inland Sea without flying machine until 27 October, when she was entrusted to transport material to Borneo. On 3 November, she was assaulted by the submarine close Makung, yet her escorting destroyer, , purposely captured the torpedoes and sank without any survivors. On her arrival voyage, the ship was ineffectively assaulted by the submarines and . On 25 November, she cruised for Manila by means of Makung to meet with the warship and the destroyers "Suzutsuki", "Fuyutsuki", and "Maki". Having stacked 200 overcomers of the war vessel , "Jun'yÅ" was assaulted by the submarines , and promptly toward the beginning of the day of 9 December 1944. She was hit by three torpedoes that overwhelmed a few compartments and murdered 19 men. These gave her a 10Â°â 12Â° rundown to starboard, yet she had the capacity to continue on one motor. She came to Sasebo the next day and started fixes on 18 December. 

The fixes were surrendered in March 1945 for absence of materials and the ship was moved from the dock to Ebisu Bay, Sasebo, on 1 April. Endeavors to cover the ship started on 23 April and she was renamed as a watchman transport on 20 June. "Jun'yÅ"s deadly implement was requested expelled on 5 August and the ship was surrendered to the Allies on 2 September. An American specialized group assessed the ship's condition on 8 October and esteemed her a valuable complete misfortune. "Jun'yÅ" was stricken from the Navy List on 30 November and rejected between 1 June 1946 and 1 August 1947 by the Sasebo Ship Company.
