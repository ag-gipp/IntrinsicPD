Sovereign George of Denmark 

Sovereign George of Denmark and Norway, Duke of Cumberland (; 2 April 165328 October 1708), was the spouse of Queen Anne, who ruled over Great Britain from 1702 to 1714. 

His marriage to Anne was organized in the mid 1680s with the end goal of building up an Anglo-Danish collusion to contain Dutch sea control. Accordingly, George was disliked with his Dutch brother by marriage, William III of Orange, who was hitched to Anne's senior sister, Mary. William and Mary ended up joint rulers of Britain, with Anne as their beneficiary possible, in 1689 after the "Wonderful Revolution" ousted James II and VII, the dad of both Anne and Mary. 

William prohibited George from dynamic military administration, and neither George nor Anne used any incredible impact until after the passings of Mary and after that William, so, all things considered Anne moved toward becoming ruler. Amid his significant other's rule, George every so often utilized his impact in help of his better half, notwithstanding when secretly contradicting her perspectives. He had an accommodating way and little enthusiasm for legislative issues; his arrangement as Lord High Admiral in 1702 was generally privileged. 

Anne's seventeen pregnancies by George brought about twelve unnatural birth cycles or stillbirths, four baby passings, and a constantly debilitated child, William, who kicked the bucket at eleven years old. In spite of the historical backdrop of their kids, George and Anne's marriage was a solid one. George passed on matured 55 from a common and constant lung sickness, a lot to the obliteration of his significant other, and he was covered in Westminster Abbey. 

George was conceived in Copenhagen Castle, and was the more youthful child of Frederick III, King of Denmark and Norway, and Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-LÃ¼neburg. His mom was the sister of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-LÃ¼neburg, later Elector of Hanover. From 1661, his representative was Otto Grote, later Hanoverian priest to Denmark. Grote was "more squire and statesman than teacher" and when he left for the Hanoverian court in 1665, he was supplanted by the more viable Christen Lodberg. George got military preparing, and embraced a Grand Tour of Europe, going through eight months in 1668â 69 in France and mid-1669 in England. His dad passed on in 1670, while George was in Italy, and George's senior sibling, Christian V, acquired the Danish honored position. George returned home through Germany. He went through Germany again in 1672â 73, to visit two of his sisters, Anna Sophia and Wilhelmine Ernestine, who were hitched to the constituent rulers of Saxony and the Palatinate. 

In 1674, George was a possibility for the Polish elective position of authority, for which he was sponsored by King Louis XIV of France. George's staunch Lutheranism was an obstruction to decision in Roman Catholic Poland, and John Sobieski was picked. In 1677, George presented with unique excellence with his senior sibling Christian in the Scanian War against Sweden. His sibling was caught by the Swedes at the Battle of Landskrona, and George "carve his way through the adversaries' numbers, and saved him at the fast approaching risk of his own life." 

As a Protestant, George was viewed as a reasonable accomplice for the niece of King Charles II of England, Lady Anne. They were indirectly related (second cousins once expelled; they were both dropped from King Frederick II of Denmark), and had never met. George was facilitated by Charles II in London in 1669, however Anne had been in France at the season of George's visit. Both Denmark and Britain were Protestant, and Louis XIV was excited about an Anglo-Danish collusion to contain the intensity of the Dutch Republic. Anne's uncle Laurence Hyde, first Earl of Rochester, and the English Secretary of State for the Northern Department, Robert Spencer, second Earl of Sunderland, arranged a marriage bargain with the Danes covertly, to keep the plans spilling to the Dutch. Anne's dad, James, Duke of York, respected the marriage since it lessened the impact of his other child in-law, Dutch Stadtholder William III of Orange, who was normally discontent with the match. 

George and Anne were hitched on 28 July 1683 in the Chapel Royal at St James' Palace, London, by Henry Compton, Bishop of London. The visitors included King Charles II, Queen Catherine, and the Duke and Duchess of York. Anne was casted a ballot a parliamentary recompense of Â£20,000 per year, while George got Â£10,000 every year from his Danish domains, despite the fact that installments from Denmark were regularly late or deficient. Lord Charles gave them a lot of structures in the Palace of Whitehall known as the Cockpit (close to the site of what is currently Downing Street in Westminster) as their London home. 

George was not aggressive, and would have liked to carry on with a tranquil existence of home life with his better half. He kept in touch with a companion: "We talk here of going to tea, of going to Winchester, and everything else aside from sitting still all late spring, which was the stature of my desire. God send me a peaceful life some place, for I will not be long ready to endure this never-ending movement." 

Inside months of the marriage, Anne was pregnant however the infant, a young lady, was stillborn in May. Anne recuperated at the spa town of Tunbridge Wells, and throughout the following two years, she brought forth two little girls one after another, Mary and Anne Sophia. In mid 1687, inside only days, George and his two youthful little girls got smallpox, and Anne endured another premature delivery. George recouped, yet the two his little girls passed on. Woman Rachel Russell composed that George and Anne had "taken [the deaths] in all respects intensely. The primary alleviation of that distress continued from the compromising of a more noteworthy, the Prince being so sick of a fever. I never heard any connection more moving than that of seeing them together. In some cases they sobbed, now and then they grieved in words; at that point sat quiet, connected at the hip; he wiped out in bed, and she the carefullest medical attendant to him that can be envisioned." He came back to Denmark for a two-month visit in mid-1687, while Anne stayed in England. Soon thereafter, after his arrival, Anne brought forth another dead youngster, this time a child. 

In February 1685, King Charles II passed on without authentic issue, and George's dad in-law, the Roman Catholic Duke of York, moved toward becoming ruler as James II in England and Ireland and James VII in Scotland. George was named to the Privy Council and welcomed to go to Cabinet gatherings, despite the fact that he had no capacity to modify or influence choices. William of Orange wouldn't go to James' crowning celebration generally in light of the fact that George would outweigh him. In spite of the fact that they were the two children in-law of King James, George was additionally the child and sibling of a ruler thus outranked William, who was a chosen stadtholder of a republic. 

Anne's more seasoned sister Mary had moved to the Netherlands after her marriage to William of Orange. Protestant restriction to James was along these lines progressively centered around Anne and George rather than Mary, who was beneficiary possible. The social and political gathering focused on George and Anne was known as the "Cockpit Circle" after their London habitation. On 5 November 1688, William attacked England in an activity, known as the "Brilliant Revolution", which at last removed King James. George was cautioned by the Danish agent in London, Frederick Gersdorff, that William was collecting an intrusion armada. George educated Gersdorff that James' military was offended, and therefore he would deny any order under James, however just fill in as an uncommissioned volunteer. Gersdorff's elective intend to empty George and Anne to Denmark was dismissed by George. George went with the King's troops to Salisbury in mid-November, yet different nobles and their officers before long abandoned James for William. At every abandonment, George clearly shouted, ""Est-il conceivable?"" (Is it conceivable?). He surrendered James on 24 November, and favored William. "So 'Est-il conceivable' is gone as well", James evidently commented. In his journals, James rejected George's absconding as insignificant, saying the loss of one great trooper was of more result, yet Gersdorff asserted the abandonment significantly irritated the King. The abandonment of George and different nobles was instrumental in shaving endlessly the King's help. In December, James fled to France, and early the next year William and Mary were proclaimed joint rulers, with Anne as beneficiary possible. 

Toward the beginning of April 1689, William consented to a bill naturalizing George as an English subject, and George was made Duke of Cumberland, Earl of Kendal and Baron of Okingham (Wokingham) by the new rulers. He sat down in the House of Lords on 20 April 1689, being presented by the Dukes of Somerset and Ormonde. 

The question among George and William was put aside amid the insurgency of 1688â 89 however hounded relations amid the last's rule. George held home loans on Femern, TremsbÃ¼ttel and Steinhorst, Schleswig-Holstein, which he surrendered to the Duke of Holstein as a feature of the tranquility of Altona of 1689 consulted by William among Denmark and Sweden. William consented to pay George intrigue and the capital in pay, however George stayed unpaid. Amid the military battle against James' supporters in Ireland, George went with the Williamite troops at his own cost, yet was avoided from order, and was even declined consent to go in his brother by marriage mentor. Scorned from the military by William, George looked to join the naval force, without rank, yet was again foiled by his brother by marriage. At the point when William's Dutch gatekeepers neglected to salute George, Anne expected they were acting compelled. George and Anne resigned from court. Some level of compromise was accomplished after Queen Mary's abrupt and startling demise from smallpox in 1694, which made Anne beneficiary clear. In November 1699, William at long last suggested that Parliament pay the home loan obligation to George, and in mid 1700, the obligation was respected. 

By 1700, Anne had been pregnant no less than multiple times; multiple times, she prematurely delivered or brought forth stillborn youngsters, and two of their five kids brought into the world alive passed on inside multi day. The just a single of the couple's youngsters to endure earliest stagesâPrince William, Duke of Gloucesterâkicked the bucket in July 1700 at 11 years old. With Gloucester's passing, Anne was the main individual in the line of progression to the royal position, as set up by the "Radiant Revolution". To broaden the line and secure the Protestant progression, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which assigned William and Anne's closest Protestant cousins, the House of Hanover, as the following in line after Anne. 

George did not assume a senior job in government until his significant other Anne prevailing as ruler on William's demise in 1702. George was the main griever at William's memorial service. Anne delegated him generalissimo of all English military powers on 17 April, and Lord High Admiral, the authority yet ostensible leader of the Royal Navy, on 20 May. Real power at the Admiralty was held by George Churchill, whose senior sibling was John Churchill, first Duke of Marlborough, an incredible companion of Anne's and the chief general of English land powers. Sovereign George had known the Churchills for a considerable length of time: another sibling Charles Churchill, had been one of his respectable men of the bedchamber in Denmark, and Marlborough had went with George on his adventure from Denmark to England for his marriage to Anne in 1683. George's secretary during the 1680s was Colonel Edward Griffith, brother by marriage of the Duchess of Marlborough, who was Anne's nearby associate and companion. George pursued William III as Captain-General of the Honorable Artillery Company, and was made Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Anne flopped, notwithstanding, in her endeavors to convince the States General of the Netherlands to choose her significant other chief general of every single Dutch power, to keep up the bound together order of the Maritime Powers that William had held. 

Anne acquired a parliamentary stipend of Â£100,000 every year for George in case of her demise. The bill sped through the House of Commons effectively however it was just barely gone by the House of Lords. Marlborough upheld the bill, however one of the rulers against was Marlborough's child in-law, Charles Spencer, third Earl of Sunderland. Marlborough prevented her from requesting that Parliament make "her beyond a reasonable doubt adored spouse King Consort". 

By and large, amid her rule, Anne and her significant other spent the winter at Kensington and St James' Palaces, and the late spring at Windsor Castle or Hampton Court Palace, where the air was fresher. George had repetitive asthma, and the cleaner air in the nation was better for his relaxing. They visited the spa town of Bath, Somerset, in mid-1702, on the guidance of George's specialists, and again in mid-1703. They incidentally visited Newmarket, Suffolk, to see the steed hustling. On one visit, Anne purchased George a pony, Leeds, for the tremendous entirety of a thousand guineas. 

Toward the finish of 1702, the Occasional Conformity Bill was acquainted with Parliament. The bill intended to preclude Protestant Dissenters from open office by shutting an escape clause in the Test Acts, enactment that limited open office to Anglican conventionalists. The current law allowed mavericks to get to work on the off chance that they took Anglican fellowship once per year. Anne was agreeable to the measure, and constrained George to vote in favor of the bill in the House of Lords, despite the fact that, being a rehearsing Lutheran, he was an incidental conventionalist himself. As he make his choice, he purportedly told an adversary of the bill, "My heart is vid you" . The bill did not accumulate adequate parliamentary help and was in the end dropped. The next year, the bill was resuscitated, however Anne retained help, dreading its reintroduction was a conscious misrepresentation to cause a fight between the two principle political gatherings: the Tories (who upheld the bill) and the Whigs (who restricted it). Indeed it fizzled. George never turned into an individual from the Church of England, which was going by his significant other all through her rule. He stayed Lutheran even after her increase, and had his very own sanctuary. 

In the primary long periods of Anne's rule, the Whigs increased more power and impact to the detriment of the Tories. In his ability as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, George held impact in parliamentary precincts on the south shoreline of England, which he used to help Whig competitors in the general race of 1705. In that year's race for Speaker of the House of Commons, George and Anne upheld a Whig competitor, John Smith. George educated his secretary, George Clarke, who was a Member of Parliament, to vote in favor of Smith, yet Clarke won't, rather supporting the Tory competitor William Bromley. Clarke was sacked, and Smith was chosen. 

In March and April 1706, George was truly sick. There was blood in his sputum, however he appeared to recuperate, in spite of the fact that he was too sick to even think about attending a thanksgiving administration at St Paul's Cathedral in June for a British triumph in the Battle of Ramillies. He missed another thanksgiving administration in May 1707, to commend the association of England and Scotland, as he was recovering at Hampton Court. 

The Scilly maritime debacle of 1707, in which an armada instructed by Sir Cloudesley Shovell foundered, featured bungle at the Admiralty, for which George was ostensibly capable. Weight developed to supplant Admiral Churchill with somebody progressively unique. By October 1708, five ground-breaking government officials, known as the Whig JuntoâLords Somers, Halifax, Orford, Wharton and Sunderlandâwere clamoring for the evacuation of both Prince George and Churchill. Marlborough kept in touch with his sibling instructing him to leave, however Churchill cannot, ensured by Prince George. 

In the midst of the political weight, George was on his deathbed, experiencing serious asthma and dropsy. He kicked the bucket at 1:30Â p.m. on 28 October 1708 at Kensington Palace. The Queen was crushed. James Brydges wrote to General Cadogan, 

His passing has flung the Queen into an unspeakable sorrow. She never abandoned him till he was dead, however kept kissing him the exact instant his breath left his body, and 'twas with a lot of trouble my Lady Marlborough influenced her to abandon him. 

Anne kept in touch with her nephew, Frederick IV of Denmark, "the loss of such a spouse, who cherished me so beyond a reasonable doubt thus devotedly, is unreasonably pulverizing for me to have the capacity to manage it as I should." Anne was urgent to remain at Kensington with the body of her significant other, yet under strain from the Duchess of Marlborough, she reluctantly left Kensington for St James' Palace. Anne hated the Duchess' nosy activities, which included expelling a representation of George from the Queen's bedchamber and after that declining to return it in the conviction that it was normal "to abstain from seeing of papers or anything that had a place with one that one cherished when they were simply dead". Anne and the Duchess had been exceptionally close, however their kinship had turned out to be stressed over political contrasts. The quick consequence of George's demise harmed their relationship further. He was covered secretly at midnight on 13 November in Westminster Abbey. 

Anne rejected at first to choose another Lord High Admiral, and demanded completing the obligations of the workplace herself, without designating an individual from the administration to have George's spot. She burst into tears on the primary event she was acquired papers to sign George's stead. Undaunted, the Junto requested the arrangement of Lord Orford, an individual from the Junto and one of Prince George's driving commentators, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Chief of naval operations Churchill resigned, and Anne selected the moderate Tory Lord Pembroke to lead the Admiralty, rather than a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, notwithstanding, were named to the Cabinet in Pembroke's abandoned posts of Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The Whigs were as yet disappointed, and kept on forcing Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke surrendered after not exactly a year in office. One more month of contentions pursued before the Queen at last assented to place Orford responsible for the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709. 

Charles II, Anne's uncle, broadly said of Prince George, "I have attempted him smashed, and I have attempted him calm and there is nothing in him". He was tranquil and self-destroying. John Macky idea him "of a natural, simple aura with a decent stable seeing however unobtrusive in appearing... extremely fat, cherishes news, his container and the Queen." In ridiculing George's asthma, Lord Mulgrave said the Prince was compelled to inhale hard in the event that individuals confused him with dead and covered him. When of Queen Victoria, George had a notoriety for being a dolt, and was the objective of hate. Victoria trusted her own significant other, Prince Albert, could never fill the "subordinate part played by the dumb and irrelevant spouse of Queen Anne". During the 1930s, Winston Churchill said he "made a difference almost no", but to Anne. 

He had little effect on the running of the naval force, however he was intrigued enough with regards to route and welfare adrift to support the distribution of John Flamsteed's "Perceptions" in 1704. He was not a standout amongst the most bright political characters of his dayâhe was substance to invest his energy building model boatsâhowever he was a devoted and strong spouse to Queen Anne. Their marriage was a dedicated, cherishing and devoted one, however plagued by close to home disaster. 

The past spouse of a British ruler regnant, William of Orange, had progressed toward becoming lord, declining to take a subordinate position to Mary. William and Mary had exemplified the customary sexual orientation jobs of seventeenth-century Europe: Mary was the devoted spouse and William held the power. George and Anne, be that as it may, turned around the jobs: George was the loyal spouse and it was Anne who practiced the imperial privileges. William had accepted inaccurately that George would utilize his marriage to Anne as a methods for structure a different power base in Britain, however George never tested his significant other's position and never endeavored to accumulate impact. Anne incidentally utilized the picture of wifely goodness to escape unpalatable circumstances by guaranteeing, as a lady, she knew nothing "with the exception of what the sovereign lets me know", however it was an ingenuity. Spouses had a legitimate ideal to their better half's property, and it was contended that it was unnatural and against the congregation's lessons for a man to be liable to his significant other. George made no such case or request; he was substance to remain a sovereign and duke. "I am her Majesty's subject", he stated, "I will do nothing yet what she directions me." In the expressions of antiquarian Anne Somerset, "the way that Prince George was generally viewed as nothing accommodated individuals to his irregular status, thus, nearly coincidentally, George accomplished a noteworthy development for women's liberation." Winston Churchill composed that he 

was a fine-looking man, tall, light, and great naturedÂ ... He was neither cunning nor taken inâa straightforward, ordinary man without jealousy or aspiration, and arranged by momentous craving and hunger for every one of the delights of the table. Charles' outstanding verdictÂ ... does not do equity to the plain ideals and unfailing agreeability of his staid and dependable character. 

The Prince of Denmark's March by Jeremiah Clarke was written in his respect, and Prince George's County, Maryland, was named after him in 1696. Representations by Sir Godfrey Kneller are at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, Drumlanrig Castle in Dumfriesshire, and (in a twofold picture with George Clarke) All Souls College, Oxford. Representations in Denmark incorporate one by Willem Wissing in the Reedtz-Thott accumulation and one by Karel van Mander in the national gathering at Frederiksborg Palace.
