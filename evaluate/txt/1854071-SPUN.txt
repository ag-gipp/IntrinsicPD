The edge that truly raised Eaton's name up the card in the advancement occurred after the presentation of the label group The Hollywood Blonds (Jerry Brown and Buddy Roberts). Eaton battled the Blonds with an assortment of accomplices, including his old coach Yamamoto and "Gun" Pez Whatley.

Amid 1979 and 1980, Eaton worked a progression of singles matches against Dennis Condrey, a man he would later collaborate with to increase overall notoriety. 

Toward the finish of 1979, Eaton turned heel (trouble maker) without precedent for his vocation by joining Tojo Yamamoto's gathering of wrestlers, whom the fans despised. Despite the fact that Eaton is presently thought of fundamentally as a heel, his fans were astonished at the time. Eaton's heel run did not keep going well before he saved his previous Jet Set accomplice, George Gulas, from a two-on-one assault by The Blond Bombers (Larry Latham and Wayne Ferris) to come back to the fan-most loved side afresh. In the wake of rejoining the group, Eaton and Gulas had one last kept running with label group champions and worked an exceptional quarrel with Latham and Ferris. 

At the point when Nick Gulas' wrestling advancement shut because of lessening ticket deals, Eaton quickly wrestled for an advancement in Georgia.

The storyline of Sugar returning under the cover to battle the heels helped make the conceal man right away mainstream with the group. Eaton, alongside the remainder of Jimmy Hart's steady "the First Family", attempted futile to expose Stagger Lee. 

Eaton turned face and re-cooperated with Sugar, in spite of the fact that they kept up the storyline that Eaton's accomplice was really "Stun Lee" and not Sugar.

Subsequently, Eaton collaborated with The Moondogs (Rex and Spot) to confront Jerry Lawler and the Fabulous Ones. Amid the match, one of the Moondogs unintentionally hit Eaton with their trademark bone, costing their side the match. After the match finished, the Moondogs, just as Jimmy Hart, turned on Eaton, pounding him until he was spared by Stagger Lee. 

Not long after Eaton joined Mid-South Wrestling under advertiser Bill Watts, he turned out to be a piece of the Midnight Express. Eaton cooperated with previous opponent Dennis Condrey under the administration of Jim Cornette to frame another adaptation of the label group. The Express had recently been a gathering of wrestlers comprising of Condrey, Randy Rose and Norvell Austin, however with Eaton's landing, the Midnight Express worked only as a two-man group.

The two groups quarreled all through 1984 in Mid-South Wrestling before the Midnight Express left the advancement. The Midnight Express versus Rock 'n' Roll Express arrangement of matches were so generally welcomed by the fans that free advertisers everywhere throughout the United States still book those two groups against one another today, 20 years after the competition began. The Midnight Express had a short remain in World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas, where they quarreled for the most part with The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers). 

In 1985 Eaton, Condrey and Cornette marked with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) and were given national presentation on JCP's broadcast programs on SuperStation TBS. Not long after joining JCP, the Midnight Express reignited their quarrel with the Rock 'n' Roll Express and won the NWA World Tag group title from them in February 1986.

Presently the fan top choices, the Midnight Express needed to battle with a group thought to be disbanded always: the Original Midnight Express, which comprised of Condrey and Randy Rose, who joined JCP after a concise keep running in the AWA. The couple was driven by long-lasting Jim Cornette enemy Paul E. Perilously, in a storyline that saw them attempting to demonstrate the firsts were superior to the new form. The unexpected appearance of the Original Midnight Express gave Dangerously's group the underlying force in the fight, yet before long, Condrey left the advancement yet again. This constrained the bookers to acquire Jack Victory as a substitution as Condrey's vanishing cut the promising fight off. 

The Midnight Express at that point directed their concentration toward Paul E's. new group, The Samoan S.W.A.T. Group just as another adaptation of The Fabulous Freebirds. Eaton and Lane were crushed by the Freebirds in the finals of a competition for the emptied World Tag Team Titles. Following this misfortune, the Midnight Express cooperated with their previous adversaries The Road Warriors and "Dr. Demise" Steve Williams to overcome the SST and the Freebirds in a WarGames coordinate at The Great American Bash. Following this fight, Lane and Eaton started having issues with a youthful new group in the NWA known as "the Dynamic Dudes" (Shane Douglas and Johnny Ace). The Dudes conceded that the Midnight Express was one of their most loved groups and inquired as to whether Cornette would be their director also. Cornette consented to deal with the youthful group, to the disappointment of the Midnight Express. Subsequent to belligerence with the Express, Jim Cornette quit going with Eaton and Lane to the ring, deciding to just effectively deal with the Dudes. At the , the two groups met with Jim Cornette showing up in an impartial corner, compelled to pick between the groups. The Express begun in all respects forcefully, particularly for a group that should be fan top picks, and when the night was finished, the Midnight Express had by and by set up themselves as heels with Jim Cornette in their corner; Cornette had sided constantly with the Express.

Eaton and Anderson rapidly won the WCW World Tag Team Championship by vanquishing Ricky Steamboat and Dustin Rhodes, the group to whom Anderson and Zbyszko lost the belts, for the title and clutched the belts for five months before they lost them to the Steiner Brothers. 

The Dangerous Alliance was a predominant power in WCW.
