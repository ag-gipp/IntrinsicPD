Chicado V (1950Â â ) was a Champion Quarter Horse race horse foaled (conceived) in 1950, and thought about one of the extraordinary broodmares of her breed. She was reared by Frank Vessels of Los Alamitos, California, and prepared by Earl Holmes. 

Chicado V began just multiple times since knee issues cut off her hustling vocation. In any case, she won her initial two begins while breaking or paralleling track records, and was given the title of co-Champion Quarter Running Two-Year-Old Filly by the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) in 1952. The following year she ran her last four races, winning once and setting one more speed record. After her last race, in , she was resigned from the track to turn into a broodmare, and had nine foals. Two of her posterity were named Champion Quarter Running Horses, and every one of her foals had a sum of seven stakes race wins. One of her little girls, Table Tennis, proceeded to turn into a prominent broodmare herself, as tabled Tennis' girl Rapid Volley and granddaughter Perks. Nonetheless, three of ChicadoÂ V's childrenâTriple Chick, Three Chicks, and The Ole Manâwere her best known posterity; every one of the three wound up driving sires and are the fundamental driver of her notoriety. She was accepted into the AQHA's American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2006. 

Chicado V was reared by Frank Vessels of Los Alamitos, California and foaled in 1950. She was an individual from the Quarter Horse breed, and the AQHA enlisted her in their stud book as number 29,689. She was a girl of Chicaro Bill out of the broodmare Do Good, herself an individual from the AQHA Hall of Fame. ChicadoÂ V was a full sister to Senor Bill, a remarkable racehorse and rearing stallion, just as a stepsister to ClabberÂ II and Do Win, two other extraordinary racehorses. Chicaro Bill's dam, or mom, was a female horse named Verna Grace, who was known as Fair Chance when she dashed. Through Chicaro Bill, ChicadoÂ V was a descendent of the AQHA Hall of Fame part Traveler just as the Thoroughbred Hall of Fame part Peter Pan. On her dam's side, she followed to Louisiana Quarter Horse bloodlines just as to the AQHA Hall of Famer Peter McCue. 

Whenever develop, Chicado V stood tall. She was a darker horse, with an associated star, stripe, and clip all over as her solitary markings, or recognizing marks. Baron Holmes, a long-lasting mentor who began his hustling vocation as a man of the hour for Vessels, had the consideration of ChicadoÂ V after she was conceived, and said of her that she "was delicate, genuine delicateâin all things. She was conceived broke[n]." When she remained in a beginning door for a race, Holmes said she resembled a rabbit, since "she had huge ears and that is everything you could see, she was pretty much nothing". She likewise had a body deformity, or compliance blame, in that she had calf-knees. 

Chicado V was conveyed for race preparing as a two-year-old, at first to her proprietor's mentor, Farrell Jones, who preferred neither her calf-knees nor her propensity for running inadequately in preparing. She reliably hung behind different ponies in gathering preparing runs, and Jones sent her back to Vessels, who at that point sent her to mentor Eddie Moreno. Moreno completed her preparation and sent her to the track for her first race, a challenge that she won while setting another reputation for a two-year-old of 18.1Â seconds. Her execution induced Jones to yield, and he returned her to his preparation outbuilding. Her knees would not enable her to be hustled frequently, and she just began afresh as a two-year-old, a race at Bay Meadows Racetrack that she won while squaring with the reputation of 17.2Â seconds for the separation. 

Following a 11-month break, Chicado V came back to the track as a three-year-old, yet her legs kept on making issues.
