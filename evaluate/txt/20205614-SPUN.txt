U-1-class submarine (Austria-Hungary) 

The "U-1" class (additionally called the Lake-type) was a class of two submarines or U-water crafts worked for and worked by the Austro-Hungarian Navy (). The class included and . The vessels were worked to an American plan at the Pola Navy Yard after residential structure proposition neglected to inspire the Navy. Built somewhere in the range of 1907 and 1909, the class was a piece of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's endeavors to aggressively assess three outside submarine plans. 

Both "U-1"- class submarines were propelled in 1909. An exploratory structure, the submarines included remarkable highlights, for example, a jumping chamber and wheels for going along the seabed. Broad ocean preliminaries were directed in 1909 and 1910 to test these highlights just as different segments of the vessels, including the plunging tanks and motors for each watercraft. Security and effectiveness issues identified with the fuel motors of the two submarines prompted the Navy to buy new impetus frameworks before World War I. The plan of the "U-1" class has been depicted by maritime history specialists as a disappointment, being rendered outdated when the two submarines were charged into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1911. Regardless of this, trial of their plan gave data that the Navy used to build consequent submarines. The two submarines of the "U-1" class filled in as preparing water crafts through 1914, however they were activated quickly amid the Balkan Wars. 

At the flare-up of World War I, the "U-1"- class submarines were in drydock in Pola anticipating the establishment of diesel motors. From 1915 to 1918, the two water crafts led surveillance travels out of Trieste and Pola, however neither sank any foe vessels amid the war. Announced out of date in January 1918, the two submarines were consigned to auxiliary obligations and filled in as preparing water crafts at the Austro-Hungarian submarine base on Brioni Island, before being exchanged back to Pola toward the finish of the war. When confronting rout in October 1918, the Austro-Hungarian government exchanged its naval force to the recently framed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs to abstain from giving its boats over to the Allied Powers. Following the Armistice of Villa Giusti in November 1918, the "U-1"- class submarines were seized by Italian powers and in this manner allowed to the Kingdom of Italy under the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1920. Italy rejected the submarines at Pola soon thereafter. 

With the foundation of the Austrian Naval League in September 1904 and the arrangement of Vice-Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli to the posts of Commander-in-Chief of the Navy (German: "Marinekommandant") and Chief of the Naval Section of the War Ministry (German: "Culinary expert der Marinesektion") the next month, the Austro-Hungarian Navy started a development program befitting a Great Power. Montecuccoli promptly sought after the endeavors supported by his antecedent, Admiral Hermann von Spaun, and pushed for an incredibly extended and modernized naval force. 

Montecuccoli's arrangement as "Marinekommandant" harmonized with the main endeavors to create submarines for Austria-Hungary. Before 1904, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had appeared at no enthusiasm for submarines. In mid 1904, in the wake of enabling the naval forces of different nations to pioneer submarine advancements, Constructor General (German: "Generalschiffbauingenieur") of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, Siegfried Popper, requested the Naval Technical Committee (German: "Marinetechnisches Kommittee", MTK) to create a submarine plan. Popper himself presented his first structure for a submarine in the blink of an eye before Montecuccoli got to work; specialized issues experienced amid the underlying plan stage postponed further proposition from MTK for almost a year. At this point, Montecuccoli had started to diagram his arrangements for the eventual fate of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. 

Soon after expecting direction as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Montecuccoli drafted his first proposition for a cutting edge Austrian armada in mid 1905. It was to comprise of 12 war vessels, 4 heavily clad cruisers, 8 scout cruisers, 18 destroyers, 36 high oceans torpedo specialty, and 6 submarines. While undeniably more consideration at the time was being set upon the development of warshipsâespecially battleshipsâMontecuccoli stayed intrigued by the improvement of a submarine armada for the Austro-Hungarian Navy and energized further advancement of the program. 

Following up on Montecuccoli's underlying maritime extension plan, MTK presented its determinations for a class of submarines on 17 January 1905. The MTK configuration required a solitary structure pontoon with a waterline length of , a light emission a draft of . The submarines were proposed to dislodge when surfaced. 

The Naval Section of the War Ministry (German: "Marinesektion") stayed doubtful about the security of this structure. Further proposition put together by people in general as a major aspect of a plan rivalry were altogether dismissed by the Navy as impracticable. Therefore, the Navy chose to buy plans from three distinctive remote firms for a class of submarines. Each structure was to be joined by two submarines to test each pontoon against the others. This was done to appropriately assess the different distinctive recommendations which would approach. 

Simon Lake, Germaniawerft, and John Philip Holland were each picked by the Navy to create a class of submarines for this aggressive assessment. The two Lake-planned submarines included the "U-1" class, the Germaniawerft configuration turned into the , and the Holland configuration turned into the . In 1906, the Navy formally requested designs for the structure of two vesselsâassigned "U-1" and "U-2"â from the Lake Torpedo Boat Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut. The Austro-Hungarian Navy had reached Lake Torpedo Boat Company as right on time as 1904 for a submarine plan, however the choice to scrap the MTK proposition and start a challenge among remote developers drove the Navy to formally appeal to an offer from the American organization. In 1906, Lake headed out to Austria-Hungary to arrange the subtleties of the understanding and on 24 November, he marked the agreements with the Navy in Pola to build the "U-1"- class submarines. 

Popper specifically had high acclaim for Lake's structures, telling the American maritime draftsman, "When I saw your arrangements I perceived that you had presented significant highlights that were superior to mine, and furthermore that you had genuine encounter assembling and working submarines, so I went to the Emperor and requested that his assent substitute your kind of pontoon for my own...Do you know, Mr. Lake, I have been in charge of the plan of every single other vessel worked for the Austrian Navy amid the [past] 25 years?" 

Albeit proposed to fill in as a trial plan when at first arranged, the "U-1" class turned into the principal submarines of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The pontoons turned out to be a mistake. The maritime antiquarians David Dickson, Vincent O'Hara, and Richard Worth portrayed the "U-1" class as "out of date and temperamental when finished and experienced issues even after adjustments". RenÃ© Greger, another maritime history specialist, composed that "the sort demonstrated an all out disappointment". 

Notwithstanding these reactions and deficiencies, the test idea of the submarines gave profitable data to the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and Lake's structures tended to what the Navy was requesting when requesting the submarine class. John Poluhowich writes in his book "Argonaut: The Submarine Legacy of Simon Lake" that "the two submarines were finished as per the general inclination of Austrian authorities". 

Their structure was at first in accordance with Austro-Hungarian maritime arrangement, which focused beach front guard and watching of the Adriatic Sea. Following the beginning of World War I, it turned out to be certain that Austro-Hungarian U-water crafts should have been fit for hostile activities, in particular attacking foe dispatching in the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas. 

The "U-1"- class submarines had a general length of , with a light emission a draft of at profound burden. They were intended to dislodge surfaced, yet when submerged they uprooted . The water crafts were likewise worked with a twofold structure, instead of the single-frame configuration at first proposed by the MTK. After their modernization, the length of the pontoons was expanded to . 

Gotten from a before idea for a submarine planned for serene investigating of the ocean, the "U-1"- class configuration had a few highlights commonplace of Lake's structures. These including a plunging chamber under the bow and two variable pitch propellers. The jumping chamber was proposed for kept an eye on submerged missions, for example, wrecking ships with explosives and disjoining seaward transmit links, just as for leaving or entering the submarine amid a crisis. This jumping chamber demonstrated its convenience amid the ocean preliminaries of the "U-1" class when the group of one submarine neglected to expedite their snacks board before directing a submerged continuance test. A jumper from shore had the capacity to transport lunch for the team without the submarine reemerging. Lake's plan additionally called for two retractable wheels that, in principle, could permit travel over the seabed. The structure additionally put the plunging tanks over the waterline of the barrel shaped body, which required an overwhelming balance bottom for vertical soundness and expected flooding to be finished by siphons. 

The impetus framework for the "U-1" class comprised of two gas motors for surface running and two electric engines for running submerged. The gas motors could create , while the electric engines had a yield of . These motors could deliver a speed of while surfaced, and when submerged. The pontoons had an operational scope of while going at when surfaced, and keeping in mind that going at when submerged. For submerged controlling, the structure of the "U-1" class included four sets of jumping planes. These planes furnished the submarines with a lot of mobility. 

Both of the submarines had three torpedo tubesâtwo in the bow, one in the sternâand could convey up to five torpedoes, however commonly conveyed three. While no deck firearms were at first introduced on the "U-1" class, in 1917 a weapon was mounted on the deck of the two water crafts. These firearms were expelled in January 1918 when the vessels were pronounced out of date and continued preparing obligations. The vessels were intended for a team of 17 officers and men. 

"U-1" was set down on 2 July 1907 at the Pola Navy Yard (German:"Seearsenal") at Pola. She was trailed by "U-2" on 18 July. Development on the vessels was postponed by the need to import the American-made motors for the two submarines. "U-1" was the principal vessel propelled on 10 February 1908, and "U-2" was propelled on 3 April 1909. 

Endless supply of the two pontoons, the Austro-Hungarian Navy assessed the "U-1" class in preliminaries amid 1909 and 1910. These preliminaries were significantly longer than other ocean preliminaries because of the trial idea of the submarines and the craving by Austro-Hungarian maritime authorities to test each conceivable part of the water crafts. While the ocean preliminaries for the two submarines were in progress, endeavors were being made to hide their outcomes from the overall population, and particularly from the naval forces of remote forces. The Austro-Hungarian government endeavored to keep the development and testing of the vessels a state mystery, to the point of utilizing a large number of similar estimates which the Navy was utilizing as for the s. On 13 October 1909, as the "U-1"- class submarines were all the while experiencing ocean preliminaries, Montecuccoli tended to the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Ministry about the pressing need to force oversight confinements on the distribution of any ocean preliminary outcomes for Austria-Hungary's submarines. These measures were actualized and in February 1910 the dimension of mystery encompassing the "U-1" class was great to the point that a Uruguayan maritime officer directing a visit to Austria-Hungary was appeared of the Navy's warships with the express special case of its submarines. 

Amid these preliminaries, broad specialized issues with the gas motors of the two submarines were uncovered. Fumes exhaust and fuel vapor every now and again harmed the air inside the water crafts and expanded the danger of interior blasts, and the motors were not capable achieve the contracted speed, which was surfaced and submerged. Undoubtedly, the motor issues for the two submarines were significant to the point that on various events their groups needed to lead crisis reemerging to carry natural air into the water crafts. Due to the issues, the Austro-Hungarian Navy believed the motors to be unacceptable for wartime use and paid just for the bodies and deadly implement of the two "U-1" pontoons. While substitution diesel motors were requested from the Austrian firm "Maschinenfabrik" Leobersdorf, they consented to a rent of the gas motors at an expense of $4,544 USD yearly. On 5 April 1910, "U-1" endured motor harm when her electric engines were handicapped by a coincidental flood. 

Flooding the jumping tanks, which was important to submerge the submarines, took more than 14 minutes and 37 seconds in early tests. This was later diminished to 8 minutes. At a profundity of the structures started to hint at pressure and were in threat of being pulverized. Thus, the commission supervising the submarines' preliminaries reasoned that the greatest profundity for the submarines ought to be set at and that neither one of the boats should endeavor to jump further. The four sets of jumping planes prepared on each submarine gave the water crafts excellent submerged dealing with, and, when the vessels were appropriately cut and adjusted, the pontoons could be held inside of the ideal profundity. While surfaced, the state of the body of each submarine brought about a huge bow-wave, which brought about the bow of the vessel plunging under the water. This prompted the deck and bow packaging of the two submarines to be recreated in January 1915. Different tests demonstrated the utilization of the submarine's submerged wheels on the seabed to be practically unthinkable. 

At last, the exploratory idea of the submarines brought about a blended arrangement of ocean preliminary outcomes. Regardless of this, the "U-1"- class water crafts beat the Germaniawerft-fabricated "U-3" class and the Holland-assembled "U-5" class in both jumping and controlling abilities in the Austro-Hungarian Navy assessments. After these ocean preliminaries, "U-1" was appointed on 15 April 1911; "U-2" pursued on 22 June. 

The two submarines of the "U-1" class saw extremely constrained administration after charging, as they were initially requested and built for test purposes. In the wake of being authorized into the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the two submarines were allocated as preparing water crafts, with each vessel making upwards of ten preparing travels a month. 

Inside five months of "U-1"s charging into the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the Italo-Turkish War ejected in September 1911. In spite of the way that Austria-Hungary and Italy were ostensible partners under the Triple Alliance, strains between the two countries stayed all through the war. The Austro-Hungarian Navy was put on high caution, and the Army was sent to the Italian fringe. The war at last wound up confined in line with Austria-Hungary to parts of the eastern Mediterranean and Libya, and the First Balkan War broke out before Italy and the Ottoman Empire had the capacity to finish up a harmony understanding. The Ottoman military demonstrated deficient to overcome its rivals and inside only weeks, the Balkan League of Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro overran the vast majority of the Ottoman Empire's staying European belongings. By November 1912, Serbia seemed ready to get a port on the Adriatic Sea. Austria-Hungary firmly restricted this, as a Serbian port on the Adriatic could definitely modify the parity of intensity in the area by filling in as a Russian maritime base. 

Austria-Hungary discovered Italy contrary to a Serbian port on the Adriatic also. Rome contradicted Serbian access to the Adriatic on the conviction that Russia would utilize any Serbian ports to station its Black Sea armada. Italy additionally expected that Austria-Hungary would one day attach Serbia, and accordingly acquire Adriatic coastline with no trade of Italian-talking regions, for example, Trentino or Trieste. Russia and Serbia both challenged to Austria-Hungary with respect to its protest to a potential Serbian port on the Adriatic. Before the finish of November 1912, the risk of contention between Austria-Hungary, Italy, Serbia, and Russia, combined with charges of Serbian abuse of the Austro-Hungarian emissary in Prisrena prompted a war alarm in the Balkans. Both Russia and Austria-Hungary started preparing troops along their outskirt, while Austria-Hungary started to activate against Serbia. Amid the emergency, the whole Austro-Hungarian Navy was additionally completely prepared, including "U-1" and "U-2". They were requested to join the remainder of the armada in the Aegean Sea in case of a war with Serbia and Russia. 

By December 1912, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had, notwithstanding "U-1" and "U-2", an aggregate of seven ships, six cruisers, eight destroyers, 28 torpedo water crafts, and four submarines prepared for battle. The emergency in the end died down after the marking of the Treaty of London, which allowed Serbia free access to the ocean through a globally administered railroad, while in the meantime setting up an autonomous Albania. The Austro-Hungarian Army and Navy were along these lines deactivated on 28 May 1913. After retirement, the two submarines of the "U-1" class continued their obligations as preparing vessels. Amid one of these preparation travels on 13 January 1914 close Fasana, "U-1" was inadvertently smashed by the Austro-Hungarian reinforced cruiser . The crash annihilated the submarine's periscope. 

At the flare-up of World War I, "U-1" and "U-2" were both in drydock in Pola anticipating the establishment of their new diesel motors, batteries, and periscopes. To suit the new motors, the vessels were stretched by about . These progressions brought down the surface uprooting to yet expanded the submerged removal to . After these modernization endeavors were finished, "U-1" came back to preparing obligations until 4 October 1915. In the interim, "U-2" experienced a further refit in Pola beginning on 24 January 1915. Amid this refit, she had another conning tower introduced, which was finished on 4 June 1915. 

"U-1" proceeded as a preparation vessel for the Austro-Hungarian Navy for a little more than a month, prior being migrated to Trieste on 11 November to lead surveillance watches. "U-2" had just been moved to Trieste on 7 August 1915 after her new conning pinnacle had been introduced. The two pontoons consequently led observation travels from 1915 ahead out of Trieste. The movement to Trieste was attempted to some degree to prevent Italian maritime assaults or strikes on the pivotal Austro-Hungarian city. The "U-1"- class submarines were at that point obsolete by 1915, however their migration to Trieste deterred the Italians from their arrangements to assault the port, as Italian military knowledge proposed the submarines were on standard watch in the waters off Trieste. 

In the wake of being positioned out of Trieste for a little more than two years, "U-1" was sent back to Pola on 22 December 1917, while "U-2" stayed at Trieste until the year's end. In spite of being pronounced old on 11 January 1918, the two submarines stayed in administration as preparing water crafts at the submarine base at Brioni Island. In mid-1918, the "U-1"- class submarines were considered for administration as minesweepers, as the jumping chamber in the water crafts could enable jumpers to separate the tying down links of ocean mines. The poor state of the vessels kept the arrangement from being actualized. Close to the war's end, the two vessels were afresh taken to Pola. By October 1918 it had turned out to be evident that Austria-Hungary was confronting rout. With different endeavors to subdue patriot suppositions coming up short, Emperor Karl I chose to disjoin Austria-Hungary's union with Germany and bid to the Allied Powers trying to protect the realm from complete breakdown. On 26 October, Austria-Hungary educated Germany that their partnership was finished. In Pola, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was destroying itself along ethnic and patriot lines. 

On 29 October the National Council in Zagreb declared Croatia's dynastic connections to Hungary had arrived at a formal resolution. The National Council additionally called for Croatia and Dalmatia to be bound together, with Slovene and Bosnian associations swearing their reliability to the recently framed government. This new temporary government, while losing Hungarian guideline, had not yet proclaimed autonomy from Austria-Hungary. In this manner Emperor KarlÂ I's legislature in Vienna solicited the recently shaped State from Slovenes, Croats and Serbs for help keeping up the armada positioned at Pola and maintaining control among the naval force. The National Council would not help except if the Austro-Hungarian Navy was first set under its direction. Ruler KarlÂ I, as yet endeavoring to spare the Empire from breakdown, consented to the exchange, gave that different "countries" which made up Austria-Hungary could guarantee a lot of the estimation of the armada sometime in the future. All mariners not of Slovene, Croatian, Bosnian, or Serbian foundation were set on leave for the present; the officers were given the decision of joining the new naval force or resigning. 

The Austro-Hungarian government accordingly chose to hand over the main part of its armada to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs without a shot being discharged. This was viewed as particular to giving the armada to the Allies, as the new state had proclaimed its lack of bias. Besides, the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs had additionally not yet openly dismissed Emperor KarlÂ I, keeping the likelihood of transforming the Empire into a triple government alive. The exchange to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs started on the morning of 31 October, with Rear Admiral (German: "Konteradmiral") MiklÃ³s Horthy meeting delegates from the South Slav nationalities on board his leader, . After "short and cool" exchanges, the courses of action were settled and the handover was finished that evening. The Austro-Hungarian Naval Ensign was struck from "Viribus Unitis", and was trailed by the rest of the boats in the harbor. Power over the boats in the harbor, and the leader of the recently settled naval force for the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, tumbled to Captain Janko VukoviÄ, who was raised to the position of naval commander and assumed control over Horthy's old duties as Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet. 

Under the terms of the Armistice of Villa Giusti, marked among Italy and Austria-Hungary on 3 November 1918, this exchange was not perceived. Italian ships consequently cruised into the ports of Trieste, Pola, and Fiume the next day. On 5 November, Italian troops involved the maritime establishments at Pola. The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs endeavored to clutch their boats, yet came up short on the men and officers to do as such as most mariners who were not South Slavs had officially returned home. The National Council did not organization any men to oppose the Italians, however they censured Italy's activities as ill-conceived. On 9 November, every single outstanding boat in Pola had the Italian banner raised. At a meeting at Corfu, the Allied Powers concurred the exchange of Austria-Hungary's naval force to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs couldn't be acknowledged, in spite of compassion from the United Kingdom. Looked with the possibility of being given a final offer to hand over the previous Austro-Hungarian warships, the National Council consented to hand over the boats starting on 10 November 1918. 

In 1920 the last dispersion of the boats was settled among the Allied powers under the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The two submarines of the "U-1" class were surrendered to Italy as war reparations and rejected at Pola around the same time. Because of the preparation and observation missions the submarines occupied with all through the war, neither one of the boats sank any boats amid their vocations.
