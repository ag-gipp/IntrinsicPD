SMS "Wittelsbach" (German: Seiner MajestÃ¤t Schiff "Wittelsbach"; English: His Majesty's Ship "Wittelsbach") was the lead ship of the of pre-man of war ships, worked for the Imperial German Navy. She was the principal capital ship worked under the Navy Law of 1898, achieved by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. "Wittelsbach" was set down in 1899 at the Wilhelmshaven Navy Dockyard and finished in October 1902. She was outfitted with a primary battery of four weapons and had a top speed of . 

The ship served in the I Squadron of the German armada for most of her peacetime profession, which crossed from 1902 to 1910. Amid this period, she was busy with broad yearly preparing and making positive attitude visits to remote nations. The preparation practices amid this period gave the structure to the High Seas Fleet's activities amid World War I. She was decommissioned in September 1910, yet was reactivated in 1911 for preparing ship obligations, which kept going through 1914. 

After the beginning of World War I in August 1914, "Wittelsbach" was taken back to dynamic obligation in the IV Battle Squadron. The ship served in the Baltic Sea, including amid the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, yet observed no battle with Russian powers. By late 1915, group deficiencies and the risk from British submarines constrained the "Kaiserliche Marine" to pull back more established ships like "Wittelsbach". The ship at that point saw administration in assistant jobs, first as a preparation ship and afterward as a ship's delicate. After the war, she was changed over into a delicate for minesweepers in 1919. In July 1921, the ship was sold and separated for scrap metal. 

After the German "Kaiserliche Marine" (Imperial Navy) requested the four s in 1889, a mix of budgetary imperatives, restriction in the "Reichstag" (Imperial Diet), and an absence of a lucid armada plan deferred the obtaining of further warships. The Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt" (Imperial Navy Office), "Vizeadmiral" ("VAdm"â Vice Admiral) Friedrich von Hollmann battledâeventually effectivelyâall through the early and mid-1890s to verify parliamentary endorsement for the initial three s. In June 1897, Hollmann was supplanted by "Konteradmiral" ("KAdm"â Rear Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz, who immediately proposed and verified endorsement for the main Naval Law in mid 1898. The law approved the last two boats of the class, just as the five boats of the , the top of the line of war vessel worked under Tirpitz's residency. The "Wittelsbach"s were extensively like the "Kaiser Friedrich"s, conveying a similar weapon yet with a progressively exhaustive protective layer design. 

"Wittelsbach" was long by and large and had a light emission a draft of forward. She uprooted up to at full burden. Not at all like her sister ships, "Wittelsbach" was finished with arrangements for a squadron authority's staff, including a bigger scaffold. The ship was impelled by three 3-barrel vertical triple extension motors that drove three screws. Steam was given by six tube shaped and six water-tube boilers, all coal-terminated. "Wittelsbach"s powerplant was evaluated at , which created a top speed of . She had a group of 30Â officers and 650Â enlisted men. 

"Wittelsbach"s combat hardware comprised of a fundamental battery of four 24Â cm (9.4Â in) SK L/40 weapons in twin firearm turrets, one fore and one toward the back of the focal superstructure. Her optional deadly implement comprised of eighteen 15Â cm (5.9Â inch) SK L/40 firearms and twelve 8.8Â cm (3.45Â in) SK L/30 fast discharging weapons. The combat hardware suite was balanced with six torpedo tubes, all in above-water swivel mounts. The ship was ensured with Krupp protection plate. Her heavily clad belt was thick in the focal segment that secured her magazines and hardware spaces, and the deck was thick. The fundamental battery turrets had of protective layer plating. 

"Wittelsbach"s bottom was set down on 30 September 1899 at the "Kaiserliche Werft" (Imperial Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven, recorded under development number 25. She was requested under the agreement name "C", as another unit for the armada. "Wittelsbach" was propelled on 3 July 1900, with Kaiser Wilhelm II in participation; Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, of the House of Wittelsbach, gave a discourse at her starting service. Fruition of the ship was deferred because of a crash with the ironclad , which inadvertently smashed "Wittelsbach" in July 1902 while she was fitting out. She was dispatched on 15 October 1902, and from that point started ocean preliminaries, which were finished in December. After preliminaries finished, "Wittelsbach" was exchanged from Wilhelmshaven to Kiel in the Baltic Sea, yet she steered into the rocks in the Great Belt in substantial mist on 13 December. The group endeavored to free the ship by evacuating stores to help her, and the warship and the shielded cruiser endeavored to pull her free without progress, before extra pulls and different vessels touched base to pull "Wittelsbach" free on 20 December. In the wake of landing in Kiel, she entered "Kaiserliche Werft" Kiel for fixes. 

On 1 March 1903, she turned into the leader of "KAdm" Gustav Schmidt, the representative officer of the I Squadron. That year, the squadron was busy with the ordinary peacetime routine of individual and unit preparing, incorporating a preparation journey in the Baltic, trailed by a voyage to Spain that kept going from 7 May to 10 June. In July, she set out on the yearly journey to Norway with the remainder of the squadron. The harvest time moves comprised of a bar practice in the North Sea, a voyage of the whole armada first to Norwegian waters and after that to Kiel toward the beginning of September, lastly a fake assault on Kiel. The activities closed on 12 September. The year's preparation plan closed with a journey into the eastern Baltic that began on 23 November and a voyage into the Skagerrak that started on 1 December. "Wittelsbach" and the I Squadron took an interest in an activity in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January 1904. Further squadron practices pursued from 8 to 17 March, and a noteworthy armada practice occurred in the North Sea in May. In July, the I Squadron and the I Scouting Group visited Britain, including a stop at Plymouth on 10 July. The German armada withdrew on 13 July, destined for the Netherlands; the I Squadron tied down in Vlissingen the next day. There, the boats were visited by Queen Wilhelmina. The I Squadron stayed in Vlissingen until 20 July, when they left for a journey in the northern North Sea with the remainder of the armada. The squadron halted in Molde, Norway, on 29 July, while different units went to different ports. 

The armada reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, where it led a fake assault on the harbor on 12 August. Amid its voyage in the North Sea, the armada explored different avenues regarding remote telecommunication on a vast scale and searchlights around evening time for correspondence and acknowledgment signals. Following coming back to Kiel, the armada started arrangements for the pre-winter moves, which started on 29 August in the Baltic. The armada moved toward the North Sea on 3 September, where it partook in a noteworthy landing task, after which the boats took the ground troops from the IX Corps who had taken an interest in the activities to Altona for a procession for Wilhelm II. The boats at that point led their very own procession for the Kaiser off Helgoland on 6 September. After three days, the armada came back to the Baltic through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, where it took part in further landing activities with the IX Corps and the Guards Corps. On 15 September, the moves arrived at an end. "Wittelsbach" turned into the squadron leader on 1 October, flying the banner of "KAdm" Friedrich von Baudissin. The I Squadron went on its winter preparing journey, this opportunity toward the eastern Baltic, from 22 November to 2 December. 

"Wittelsbach" partook in a couple of preparing travels with the I Squadron amid 9â 19 January and 27 FebruaryÂ â 16 March 1905. Individual and squadron preparing pursued, with an accentuation on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the armada started a noteworthy preparing exercise in the North Sea. The armada at that point traveled through the Kattegat and halted in Copenhagen and Stockholm. The mid year voyage finished on 9 August, however the harvest time moves that would regularly have started presently were postponed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month. The British armada halted in Danzig, SwinemÃ¼nde, and Flensburg, where it was welcomed by units of the German Navy; "Wittelsbach" and the fundamental German armada was tied down at SwinemÃ¼nde for the event. Politically, the visit was stressed by the creating Anglo-German maritime weapons contest. Because of the British visit, the 1905 pre-winter moves were abbreviated significantly, from 6 to 13 September, and comprised just of activities in the North Sea. The principal practice assumed a maritime bar in the German Bight, and the second imagined an unfriendly armada endeavoring to drive the guards of the Elbe. In September, "KapitÃ¤n zur See" Maximilian von Spee, who might proceed to direction the East Asia Squadron at the flare-up of World War I, took order of the ship. 

In October, the I Squadron went on a voyage in the Baltic. Toward the beginning of December, the I and II Squadrons went on their standard winter voyageâthis opportunity to Danzig, where they touched base on 12 December. While on the arrival outing to Kiel, the armada led strategic activities. The armada embraced a heavier preparing plan for 1906 than in earlier years. The boats were busy with individual, division and squadron practices all through April. Beginning on 13 May, real armada practices occurred in the North Sea and kept going until 8 June with a voyage around the Skagen into the Baltic. The armada started its typical summer voyage to Norway in mid-July. The armada was available for the birthday of Norwegian King Haakon VII on 3 August. The German boats left the next day for Helgoland, to join practices being led there. The armada was back in Kiel by 15 August, where arrangements for the pre-winter moves started. On 22â 24 August, the armada participated in landing practices in EckernfÃ¶rde Bay outside Kiel. The moves were stopped from 31 August to 3 September when the armada facilitated vessels from Denmark and Sweden, alongside a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel. The moves continued on 8 September and kept going five more days. 

The ship partook in the uneventful winter journey into the Kattegat and Skagerrak from 8 to 16 December. The primary quarter of 1907 pursued the past example and, on 16 February, the Active Battle Fleet was re-assigned the High Seas Fleet. From the finish of May to early June the armada went on its late spring voyage in the North Sea, coming back to the Baltic by means of the Kattegat. This was trailed by the standard journey to Norway from 12 July to 10 August. Amid the pre-winter moves, which endured from 26 August to 6 September, the armada led landing practices in northern Schleswig with the IX Corps. The winter preparing journey went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November. In May 1908, the armada went on a noteworthy journey into the Atlantic rather than its typical voyage in the North Sea, which incorporated a stop in Horta in the Azores. The armada came back to Kiel on 13 August to plan for the fall moves, which kept going from 27 August to 7 September. Division practices in the Baltic promptly pursued from 7 to 13 September. After the finish of the moves, "Wittelsbach" was soothed as the squadron leader by the new war vessel and turned into the leader of the delegate officer. 

"Wittelsbach" was supplanted as the delegate direction lead on 20 September 1910, again by "Hannover", for decommissioning. Her group was sent to man the recently appointed man of war . Following a year for possible later use, "Wittelsbach" was reactivated on 16 October 1911 to supplant the war vessel in the Reserve Division of the North Sea. From 31 March to 28 April 1912, she worked with the Training Squadron, and on 9 May came back to the Reserve Division, this time assuaging the ship . She partook in the yearly armada moves that year as the lead of the III Squadron, at that point instructed by "VAdm" Max Rollmann. "Wittelsbach" returned for another spell in the Training Squadron from 30 March to 21 April 1913. Wilhelm II dispatched a statue of Frithjof that he provided for Norway; "Wittelsbach" was utilized to transport the statue, withdrawing Kiel on 5 July and landing in Balholmen two days after the fact. The ship was back in Germany in time for the armada moves in August, where she was appointed to the V Division of the III Squadron. After the finishing of the moves, she came back to the Reserve Division. 

Toward the beginning of World War I, "Wittelsbach" was activated as a feature of the IV Battle Squadron, under the order of "VAdm" Ehrhard Schmidt; she filled in as the lead of the squadron, which additionally incorporated her four sister ships and the warships and . On 26 August 1914, the boats were sent to protect the stranded light cruiser , which had steered into the rocks off Odensholm in the eastern Baltic, however by 28 August, the ship's team had been compelled to explode explosives to pulverize "Magdeburg" before the alleviation constrain had arrived. Accordingly, "Wittelsbach" and the remainder of the squadron came back to Bornholm that day. Beginning on 3 September, the IV Squadron, helped by the reinforced cruiser , led a scope into the Baltic. The activity kept going until 9 September and neglected to convey Russian maritime units to fight. 

After two days the boats were exchanged toward the North Sea, yet remained there just quickly, coming back to the Baltic on 20 September. From 22 to 26 September, the squadron participated in a scope into the eastern Baltic in a fruitless endeavor to discover and crush Russian warships. From 4 December 1914 to 2 April 1915, the boats of the IV Squadron were entrusted with waterfront resistance obligations along Germany's North Sea coast against invasions from the British Royal Navy. On 3 April, "Wittelsbach" went into drydock in Kiel for occasional upkeep, before directing preparing practices in the western Baltic with different boats of the VII Division of the IV Squadron, which included , and . 

The German Army mentioned maritime help for its crusade against Russia; Prince Heinrich, the authority of every single maritime power in the Baltic, made the VII Division, the IV Scouting Group, and the torpedo water crafts of the Baltic armada accessible for the task. On 6 May, the IV Squadron ships were entrusted with offering help to the ambush on Libau. "Wittelsbach" and different boats were positioned off Gotland to catch any Russian cruisers that may endeavor to mediate in the arrivals; the Russians did not do as such. After cruisers from the IV Scouting Group experienced Russian cruisers off Gotland, the boats of the VII Division sentâwith a third sham channel raised to camouflage them as the more dominant sâalongside the cruiser . The boats progressed similarly as the island of UtÃ¶ on 9 May and to Kopparstenarna the next day, yet by then the Russian cruisers had pulled back. Soon thereafter, the British submarines and detected the IV Squadron, yet were excessively far away to assault them. 

From 27 May to 4 July, "Wittelsbach" was back in the North Sea, watching the mouths of the Jade, Ems, and Elbe waterways. Amid this period, the maritime central leadership understood that the old "Wittelsbach"- class boats would be futile in real life against the Royal Navy, yet could be viably utilized against the a lot more fragile Russian powers in the Baltic. Accordingly, the warships were exchanged back to the Baltic in July, and they withdrew Kiel on the seventh, headed for Danzig. On 10 July, the boats continued further east to Neufahrwassar, alongside the vessels of the VIII Torpedo-watercraft Flotilla; in the wake of arriving, "Wittelsbach" steered into the rocks and Schmidt exchanged his banner to "Braunschweig". She had the capacity to free herself and was not harmed in the episode, and the next day Schmidt came back to the ship. The IV Squadron ships sortied on 12 July to make an exhibition, coming back to Danzig on 21 July without experiencing Russian powers. 

The next month, the maritime central leadership started a task against the Gulf of Riga in help of the Gorliceâ TarnÃ³w Offensive that the Army was pursuing. The Baltic maritime powers were strengthened with critical components of the High Seas Fleet, including the I Battle Squadron, the I Scouting Group, the II Scouting Group, and the II Torpedo-vessel Flotilla. Sovereign Heinrich arranged that Schmidt's boats would constrain their way into the Gulf and annihilate the Russian warships in Riga, while the overwhelming units of the High Seas Fleet would watch toward the north to keep any of the principle Russian Baltic Fleet that may attempt to meddle with the task. The Germans propelled their assault on 8 August, starting the Battle of the Gulf of Riga. Minesweepers endeavored to clear a way through the Irbe Strait, secured by "Braunschweig" and "Elsass", while "Wittelsbach" and the remainder of the squadron stayed outside the strait. The Russian war vessel assaulted the Germans in the strait, constraining them to pull back. 

Amid the activity, the cruiser and the torpedo pontoon were harmed by mines and the torpedo vessels and were mined and sunk. Schmidt pulled back his boats to re-coal and Prince Heinrich discussed making another endeavor, as at that point it had turned out to be certain that the German Army's development toward Riga had slowed down. Ruler Heinrich endeavored to drive the channel a second time utilizing two man of war ships from the I Squadron to cover the minesweepers and leaving "Wittelsbach" behind in Libau. Following the fruitless second endeavor, Schmidt turned into the I Squadron leader on 26 August, being supplanted as the IV Squadron authority by "VAdm" Friedrich Schultz, who additionally made "Wittelsbach" his leader. 

On 9 September, "Wittelsbach" and her four sisters sortied trying to find Russian warships off Gotland, however came back to port two days after the fact without having connected any adversaries. On 7 and 8 October, she, "Elsass", and four torpedo water crafts secured a minelaying task. By this point in the war, the Navy was experiencing challenges in keeping an eye on increasingly imperative vessels. The danger from submarines in the Baltic persuaded the German naval force to pull back the older "Wittelsbach"- class ships from dynamic administration. "Wittelsbach" and the greater part of the other IV Squadron sends left Libau on 10 November, headed for Kiel; upon landing the next day, they were assigned the Reserve Division of the Baltic, instructed by "Kommodore" (Commodore) Walter Engelhardt. The boats were moored in Schilksee in Kiel, with "Wittelsbach" as the divisional lead. On 31 January, the division was broken up, and the boats were scattered for auxiliary obligations. 

"Wittelsbach" was decommissioned on 24 August, and was at first utilized as a preparation send situated in Kiel. The ship was then exchanged to Wilhelmshaven for use as an armada delicate in October 1917, where she bolstered the ship , which was by then being utilized as a preparation dispatch for motor room staff. On 6 August 1918, the "Reichsmarineamt" chose to change over "Wittelsbach" into an objective ship, yet the war finished with Germany's thrashing before the work could start. "Wittelsbach" was reactivated for administration with the recently comprised Reichsmarine on 1 June 1919, and was changed over into a terminal ship for minesweepers. She conveyed 12 of these shallow-draft vessels. The ship served in this limit from 20 July 1920 to 8 March 1921. "Wittelsbach" was stricken from the Navy List and sold four months after the fact, on 7 July, for 3,561,000 Marks. The ship was then separated for scrap in Wilhelmshaven.
