Every one of the book's sections was conveyed as one address in an alternate Canadian city, starting in Vancouver on October 18 and consummation in Toronto on October 28. The addresses were publicized on CBC Radio One between November 7 and 11. The creator and speaker, Stephen Lewis, was around then the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa and previous Canadian represetative to the United Nations. Despite the fact that he composed the book and addresses in his job as a concerned Canadian native, his analysis of the United Nations (UN), universal associations, and different negotiators, including naming explicit individuals, was considered undiplomatic and drove a few commentators to conjecture whether he would be expelled from his UN position. 

In the book and the addresses, Lewis contends that noteworthy changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by their 2015 due date. Lewis clarifies the verifiable setting of Africa since the 1980s, refering to a progression of shocking monetary arrangements by worldwide money related organizations that added to, instead of decreased, destitution. He interfaces the auxiliary change advances, with states of constrained open spending on wellbeing and training foundation, to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS and resulting sustenance deficiencies as the illness contaminated a significant part of the working-age populace. Lewis likewise addresses such issues as victimization ladies and essential instruction for kids. To help reduce issues, he finishes with potential arrangements which for the most part require expanded subsidizing by G8 nations to levels past what they guarantee. 

Book analysts found the reactions useful and the composition true. His style concentrates less on numbers and insights, and more on associating choices by UN authorities and western representatives to outcomes on the ground in Africa. His onlooker accounts are said to be real to life and passionate. The book went through seven weeks at #1 on "The Globe and Mail's" Nonfiction Bestseller List. A second version was discharged in June 2006. The Canadian Booksellers Association granted its Libris Award for true to life book of the year to "Race Against Time" and its Author of the Year Award to Lewis in 2006. 

At the season of distribution, the creator, Stephen Lewis, matured 67 and living in Toronto, filled in as the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, a position he held since 2001. Beforehand he filled in as the Deputy Director of United Nations Children's Fund (1994â 99), as the Canadian envoy to the UN (1984â 88), and as pioneer of the Ontario New Democratic Party (1970â 79). After Lewis hopefully acknowledged the Special Envoy position he turned out to be progressively distressed by the demolition he saw. As of now a gifted speaker, he turned out to be progressively vocal on the subject. He established the Stephen Lewis Foundation, facilitated Oprah Winfrey as she visited Africa, and was the subject of two honor winning documentaries by "The Nature of Things", entitled "Race Against Time" and "The Value of Life". Then he was contributed as a Companion of the Order of Canada, granted the Pearson Medal of Peace, and named Canadian of the Year (2003) by "MacLean's" magazine. In 2005, he was welcome to convey the yearly arrangement of Massey Lectures from which the book, "Race Against Time", was adjusted. He composed the content in right on time to mid-2005 and conveyed the address arrangement in October when the book was discharged. Lewis composed the book, not as a worker of the UN, however as a native worried about the world's reaction to the AIDS challenge in Africa. 

The book comprises of five sections, from which the five addresses were inferred: Context, Pandemic, Education, Women, and Solutions. Before these parts are segments titled Preface and Acknowledgments, and a while later a Glossary segment. The book's second version contains an Afterword segment written in May 2006. In the Preface, composed by Lewis in August 2005, he expresses that his favored sort is the verbally expressed word and that the idea of the point would not enable him to exhaustively cover each perspective. He legitimizes his composition by broadcasting himself a lover to the United Nations and diagrams the jobs he has held with the association since 1984. In the primary section, Lewis advises accounts of visits to Africa and other UN-related occasions like, in 1986, facilitating the goals from the General Assembly's thirteenth Special Session. He recognizes expansionism and Cold War ideologues as recorded impacts on the African circumstance, yet centers around the impacts of global fund organizations' restrictive credits since the late 1980s. 

In the second part Lewis examines his history in Africa, starting during the 1960s as an English educator in Ghana. He differentiates Africa of the 1960s shedding pioneer rule, idealistic in future prospects, with Africa of the 2000s battling with AIDS and progressively across the board hunger. He recognizes the mind channel pattern, noticing "there are more Malawian specialists in Manchester [England] than in Malawi". In the third section Lewis looks at how the UN, World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) neglected to satisfy guarantees of free access to essential instruction. In the occurrences where school section charges were dispensed with, extra expenses ("e.g." expenses for garbs, books, tests, and enlistment) had a similar impact of restricting access. The fourth section explains on how ladies' issues are overlooked or rejected at worldwide meetings and by African governments. Lewis recognizes the sexual orientation separation that happens even inside the UN association, whose administration staff was commanded by guys. He connects the World Bank and IMF states of low social spending on training and human services by legislatures of beneficiary nations to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS in those equivalent nations. The illness annihilated Africa's working age and cultivating populace, prompting starvation. He approaches the universal budgetary organizations to pay "reparations" as obligation help. 

Lewis reasons that emotional changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. In the last part, he thinks of some as potential estimates that could help in Africa. He regrets the deficits in subsidizing by G8 nations, in spite of the proceeded with restored guarantees for full financing of Millennium Development Goal execution. His proposed measures include: 

The composition style mirrors the creator's aim to utilize the content for an address arrangement. The portrayal tends to the gathering of people while directing it through clarifications of the issues and episodic delineations. Lewis' charming, expressive, and vivacious discourse style is reflected in the composition. The tone has been portrayed as noisy and enticing. One commentator called it "vintage Lewis â sharp analysis raised with high-blown talk". The book concentrates more upon certifiable human encounters, instead of numbers and insights, in talking about the impact of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and the world's reaction. Lewis' onlooker accounts are real to life and distinctive. For instance, he relates voyages through medical clinics and schools as he clarifies the desperate straits of national wellbeing and training divisions, and he portrays gatherings with ambassadors and staff from the UN, World Bank, and IMF as he clarifies their impact on outside guide approaches. The book is composed from a hopeful point of view and, notwithstanding the outrage and hidden feeling of blame, Lewis stays idealistic. While he was an expert ambassador, his diary style reflections on explicit individuals, for example, Michel Camdessus, Carol Bellamy, and Thabo Mbeki were called undiplomatic. Regardless of the book's undiplomatic style, Lewis held his post as an UN Special Envoy until the term finished in December 2006. 

The book was discharged on October 18 as Lewis started the Massey address arrangement in Vancouver. The second address occurred in Winnipeg on the twentieth, trailed by Montreal on the 22nd, Halifax on the 26th, and the last one in Toronto two days after the fact. The arrangement was recorded at that point disclosed on CBC Radio One's "Thoughts" between November 7 and 11. At every occasion Lewis handled inquiries from the group of onlookers and took an interest in book signings. The distributer, House of Anansi Press, was on the most recent year of its agreement with CBC to distribute the Massey Lecture arrangement; confronting a focused offer from Penguin Books, Anansi forcefully advanced "Race Against Time", with Lewis offering meetings to nearby media and going to gatherings. CBC advanced the occasions broadly. Following an underlying printing of 25,000 duplicates of the book by Anansi, alongside the sound CDs created by CBC Audio, there was a second imprinting in June 2006 with another Afterword area. 

In the Canadian market, "Race Against Time" appeared at #5 on "The Globe and Mail's" Nonfiction Bestseller List on October 29. It went through seven weeks at #1, and forty weeks in the main ten. Selections from the book were distributed in "The Globe and Mail", "The Montreal Gazette", and "Options Journal". At the Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Awards in June 2006, the book won true to life book of the year and Lewis won the Author of the Year Award. The book was short-recorded for the Pearson Writers' Trust Prize and the Trillium Book Award. 

The book was decidedly gotten by analysts. The exposition has been called great, clear, articulate, and enthusiastic. Lewis' enthusiastic intrigue has been called surprisingly real, genuine, amazing, and moving. Associating the discretionary and arrangement level work of the UN and World Bank with explicit impacts on the ground in Africa, and portraying the issue of vagrants, were among the qualities of the book. Lewis' reactions are helpful and, since they originate from such an enthusiastic multilateralist utilized by the United Nations, definitive. One commentator scrutinized a few of Lewis' potential arrangements as adding to a similar framework that reliably neglects to address its imperfections. A similar analyst distinguished as the book's shortcoming its political inclination, which overlooks degenerate or wasteful African governments and the substances of asking organizations and western governments to make strides against their personal circumstance, such as dropping horticultural sponsorships on account of governments and giving benefits on account of organizations. A few analysts noticed that the book could be utilized as a viable device to teach about the HIV/AIDS emergency and the predicament of the general population of sub-Saharan Africa. 

An article in "The New York Times", in October 2005, wrote about the book's analysis of South Africa's administration, singling out President Thabo Mbeki and Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang. Lewis asserted that the South African projects were apathetic and confounding; a representative for the Health Ministry portrayed Lewis as a one-sided and clueless judge of South Africa's circumstance, and countered that they are quickly extending treatment programs. In August 2006, as a keynote speaker at the International AIDS Conference in Toronto, Lewis continued his analysis, calling South Africa's administration "still heartless, lazy and careless about taking off treatment".
