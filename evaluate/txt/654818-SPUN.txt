The makers of the "Myst" establishment gave the assignment of making the third "Myst" diversion to Presto Studios, known for its experience amusement arrangement "The Journeyman Project". Presto looked to build up a differing and sensible way to deal with riddles and Ages, and attempted to make the scoundrel thoughtfully multifaceted. The engineers enlisted Jack Wall to build up a melodic style not quite the same as prior arranger Robyn Miller yet at the same time unmistakable as a "Myst" diversion. The undertaking required a great many U.S. dollars and over two years to finish. 

"Outcast" was gotten well by faultfinders; "The Daily Telegraph" considered it the best diversion in the "Myst" arrangement. Alternately, long-term faultfinders of the arrangement grumbled that "Outcast" kept on demonstrating that "Myst"s slower ongoing interaction did not have a place in the quick paced current diversion showcase; GameSpot editorial manager Greg Kasavin portrayed the "Myst" arrangement as having lost its significance.

In contrast to past recreations, which utilized a progression of still pictures, "Outcast" utilizes a "free look" framework which gives the player a 360-degree field of view. The diversion additionally has a discretionary Zip mode, as "Myst" and "Riven", to cross investigated landscape rapidly by skirting a few hubs. Clicking enables the player to control articles and get things. The on-screen cursor changes in setting to demonstrate conceivable activities. 

Every one of the amusement's Ages has a particular look and topic. Players start their adventure on the Age of J'nanin, which goes about as a center connecting to different Ages and as an "exercise Age" exhibiting imperative standards for later riddles. Three of these Ages are Amateria, a mechanical Age amidst a tremendous ocean; Edanna, a universe of safeguarded nature, with rich plant and creature life; and Voltaic, a dusty island loaded with gullies loaded up with man-made developments. 

By social affair pieces of information and controlling the earth, the player unravels specifically connected riddles. For instance, the book prompting Voltaic is gotten to by adjusting light emissions over a gulch; the Age itself contains comparative vitality based riddles. Edanna's plant-filled riddles require control of the Age's biological system. Riddles regularly include watching cooperations between components of the earth, at that point modifying the connections between them. The player can likewise get and see diaries or pages composed by amusement characters which uncover back-story and offer insights to settling baffles. Cursor Mode enables the player to choose things from an individual stock at the base of the screen. 

"Outcast" starts 10 years after the occasions of "Riven", when the Stranger touches base at the home of Atrus and his better half Catherine. Atrus is a researcher and adventurer who has aced an antiquated practice known as the Art: he can make connects to various Ages by composing exceptional books. This capacity is by an antiquated human progress known as the D'ni, whose general public disintegrates after the D'ni city is crushed by a plague. Atrus calls the Stranger to his home to show his most up to date Age, Releeshahn, which Atrus has structured as another home for the D'ni survivors. 

As Atrus is getting ready to leave for Releeshahn, a puzzling man shows up in Atrus' examination, takes the Releeshahn book and abandons another. Following the hoodlum, the Stranger lands at J'nanin, an Age that Atrus had composed well before as an approach to show the Art to his children. Since the criminal has made impressive harm the J'nanin book, Atrus can't go with the Stranger. 

The baffling man is named Saavedro. Twenty years sooner, Atrus' wayward children Sirrus and Achenar decimated Saavedro's home Age of Narayan and caught him on J'nanin. Saavedro trusts his family is dead and swears retaliation on Atrus, uninformed that Atrus has effectively detained his children for their wrongdoings and that Saavedro's family is as yet alive. The amusement can end a few different ways relying upon the player's activities. In the best situation, Saavedro comes back to Narayan gently in the wake of giving back the book of Releeshahn. Different endings result in Saavedro decimating Releeshahn or slaughtering the player; another choice enables the player to leave Saavedro caught until the end of time. 

Cyan Worlds and Mattel (at that point the proprietor of the "Myst" and "Riven" establishment) offered the errand of building up the continuation of a few improvement organizations; as indicated by "Amusement Developer", invested individuals created recommendations including story ideas, investigation of the initial two recreations, innovation exchange, and innovation showing. A center group from Presto Studios had exchanges which broke down "Myst" and "Riven", at that point set out explicit objectives for the third amusement. As indicated by Presto organizer and maker Greg Uhler, these objectives included visual assortment in the Ages, a wonderful consummation, and a path for players to check their advancement amid the amusement. The advancement objective was critical for Uhler, who expressed: "Players who had neglected to finish "Myst" or "Riven" did as such in light of the fact that they were uncertain of what amount survived from the amusement and what their objectives were." Initially, Presto arranged three conceivable storylines for the diversion to pursue; a gathering between Cyan, Presto, and Mattel yielded a totally unique plot, which investigated a portion of the last details indicated in "Myst". Presto burned through a huge number of U.S. dollars building up the diversion, utilizing the studio's whole staff to finish the undertaking. Improvement took more than two years, of which nine months were spent on plan and pre-creation. 

Pre-rendered situations, similar to those in the prior "Myst" amusements, were utilized, giving what maker Dan Irish depicted as the "photorealistic capacity to show the world convincingly. The 360-degree camera see likewise enables you to encounter it such that makes it feel genuine." Particular consideration was dedicated to solid visual styles and mechanics, which a commentator portrayed as "a cooperation of Jules Verne, Rube Goldberg and Claes Oldenburg". 

As in "Myst" and "Riven", the designers utilized no frills arrangements rather than PC created performing artists and props; Irish expressed that utilizing PC illustrations would have reminded players they were in a diversion, "which would wreck the submersion that is so basic to the "Myst" amusements". Live on-screen characters were recorded on a blue screen and after that put in the advanced situations utilizing chroma key innovation. Before any shooting could start, every one of the sets were built and loaded up with props the performing artists could utilize, ensembles for every one of the characters were formed, and every scene was plotted out by storyboard. Rand Miller came back to play Atrus, a job he had filled since the first "Myst" amusement. Brad Dourif, an expert performing artist best known for the "No problem" films, consented to play Saavedro on the grounds that he was an immense "Myst" fan. Dourif noticed that representing a diversion was significantly more troublesome than taking a shot at motion picture sets, as he couldn't see the player or communicate with the amusement condition. Different performers included Maria Galante as Atrus' better half Catherine, and Greg Uhler's little girl Audrey in an appearance as Atrus' girl Yeesha. Arrangement for the video shoots took four months; recording the scenes took only seven days. Uhler noticed that the video was one part of "Myst" that Presto "fouled up"; in light of the fact that superior quality camcorders were not utilized, the subsequent video was not as fresh as engineers had trusted. 

The music for "Myst" and "Riven" was formed by Robyn Miller; Jack Wall made the score for the third portion. Irish expressed that building up the music was one of the hardest parts of "Outcast": "We needed to coordinate or surpass the surrealistic style of music that Robyn [Miller] had spearheaded. It must be unmistakable as "Myst", yet special and particular." Wall took a gander at the expanding intricacy of diversions as a chance to give players a soundtrack with as much power as a motion picture score. Divider likewise resounded Irish's supposition that he needed to make an altogether different score from the "awesome sonic pastiche" of "Myst" and "Riven", yet still conspicuous as a continuation of the prior diversions; Wall considered duplicating Miller's style as the "safe" yet unappealing course that was anticipated from him. 

In anticipation of his piece, Wall considered Miller's music, taking note of that he and Miller contrasted on their utilization of music hypothesis. Mill operator, as indicated by Wall, felt that "song could without much of a stretch hinder the experience of playing the diversion", however Wall felt that some tune gave something topical to the player to get a handle on. Divider needed the music to have a feeling of direction while as yet safeguarding intuitiveness, so he formed "compensate music" for finishing confuses and recorded the score with a genuine ensemble.

The riddles were portrayed as not so much troublesome but rather more contained, implying that players did not need to explore different avenues regarding switches and afterward click a few screens away to see the impact, as in "Riven".

GameSpot's Scott Osborne noticed that because of the edge by-outline nature of ongoing interaction, it was at times hard to perceive where players were permitted to wander and what regions were inaccessible. The "Los Angeles Times" announced that bugs including an absence of sound, contrariness with specific designs cards and framework crashes were available in upwards of 10 percent of the principal shipment of circles. Analysts who had not delighted in "Myst" or "Riven" expressed that there was just the same old thing new or generously extraordinary in the diversion to warrant intrigue; "The New York Times" watched, ""Exile" has all that you adored or loathed about "Myst" and "Riven"."
