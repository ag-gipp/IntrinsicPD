The club initially played at Newmarket Road before moving to The Nest. At the point when The Nest was esteemed lacking for the extent of groups it was pulling in, the Carrow Road ground, named after the street on which it is found, was reason worked by Norwich City in only 82 days and opened on 31 August 1935. 

The arena has been adjusted and updated a few times amid its history, remarkably following a flame that annihilated the old City Stand in 1984. Having once suited standing supporters, the ground has been all-seater since 1992. The ground's ebb and flow limit is 27,244, the latest works being the expansion of roughly 1,000 seats in the mid year of 2010.

Norwich City F.C. played at Newmarket Road from 1902 to 1908, with a record participation of 10,366 out of 1908. Following an argument about the states of leasing Newmarket Road, the club moved to another home in 1908, a changed over neglected chalk pit in Rosary Road, Norwich. The new ground wound up known as The Nest, named for Norwich City's epithet, "The Canaries". 

By the 1930s, the ground limit was demonstrating inadequate for the developing groups: The Nest's biggest group was 25,037 in the 1934â 35 FA Cup. The physical impediments of the site of The Nest implied that development was unrealistic, and there were wellbeing issues with the current structures. The club started searching for elective settlement in 1926, their hand constrained at long last when one corner of the pitch died down up to 30 feet after old chalk operations crumbled. An endeavor to fix up the issue with railroad sleepers and soil neglected to inspire The Football Association (FA), who kept in touch with the club on 15 May 1935, saying The Nest "was never again appropriate for huge groups and measures must be taken". 

The club's issue was intense: the FA never again endorsed of vast groups at The Nest, however the new season was only weeks away. About a large portion of a mile south of The Nest, they found another site, the Boulton Paul Sports Ground in Carrow Road, which had a place with J. and J. Colman. 

The new arena took its name from the road which encases the ground on three sides, the fourth limit being the River Wensum. The name "Carrow" initially alludes to the previous Carrow Abbey that once remained on the riverside, its name thus having conceivable Norse starting points. In 1800, John Ridges, proprietor of the Carrow Abbey Estate and the land inverse on the banks of the Wensum in Thorpe Hamlet, "conceded consent for a proposed street access over his grounds to Carrow". By 1811, Philip M. Martineau, a specialist, possessed the structure, terrains and estate of Carrow, including the nearby Thorpe land. Carrow Hill Road was made on his Carrow Abbey Estate, to give work to the poor in the network. The street connected Martineau's Bracondale Estate to Carrow Toll Bridge, introduced in 1810. Norwich Railway Co. had procured the land in Thorpe around Carrow Road by the 1840s, and by 1860 the Thorpe site of things to come arena had a place with the firm of J. and J. Colman. The arena's Thorpe Corner recognizes this chronicled connection. In 1935, Colman's offered the 20-year leasehold to Norwich City and development of the new arena started quickly on the site: tenders were issued on the day the site was acquired and after ten days, on 11 June, work started. 

Beginning materials were sourced by obliterating the previous "Chicken Run" segment of The Nest, with the rubble dumped as a bank at the waterway end of the new ground. From that point, work continued rapidly, with the greater part of the stands and porches worked by 17 August. A training match was hung on 26 August with work "still in advancement", and, after only 82 days, on 31 August, the ground was opened for a Second Division apparatus including West Ham United. The arena had an underlying limit of 35,000, including 5,000 seats under spread. Norwich won 4â 3; the participation was 29,779, which set another club record swarm for a home amusement. The principal focused objective at the ground was scored by Norwich's Duggie Lochhead. 

The new arena was depicted by club authorities as "the biggest development work in the city since the structure of Norwich Castle", "wonderfully inherent only 82 days" and "the eighth miracle of the world". A flying photo from August 1935 shows three sides of open terracing, and a secured remain with a Colman's Mustard notice painted on its rooftop, unmistakable just from the air. The club's relationship with Colman's has proceeded into the cutting edge time; in 1997 the club marked a shirt sponsorship manage the organization. The mustard producer's unique processing plant was found adjoining the arena in Carrow Road, and the ground was opened by Russell Colman, the President of the club. The creator Simon Inglis depicts the early Carrow Road as including "a Main Stand, a secured end patio and two extensive open banks". The secured porch was paid for by Captain Evelyn Barclay, the VP of Norwich City; it was developed in time for the opening of the 1937â 38 season, and keeping in mind that the first development is a distant memory, the end holds the name of its sponsor. 

Right now, the ground's ability was 38,000, with space for 10,000 of "the more vociferous of the home and away supporters", in the new Barclay end. The new ground got a regal seal of endorsement: on 29 October 1938, King George VI watched twenty minutes of the home amusement versus Millwall, the first run through a decision ruler had watched a Second Division coordinate. 

Floodlights were raised at the ground in 1956 and the Â£9,000 cost almost sent the club into liquidation. Be that as it may, Norwich's achievement in the 1958â 59 FA Cup (where as a Third Division club they achieved the semi-last, losing to First Division Luton Town after a replay) verified the money related status of the club and gave adequate assets to a spread to be worked over the South Stand. In 1963, the record was set for participation at Carrow Road: a horde of 43,984 viewed a 6th round FA Cup coordinate against Leicester City, and the South Stand was secured without further ado a short time later. 

In the wake of the Ibrox arena catastrophe in 1971, an administration enquiry brought increasingly stringent wellbeing necessities, which, when connected to Carrow Road, brought about the limit being definitely diminished to around 20,000. With spotlight on the risks of standing, seats started to supplant terracing: by 1979, the arena had a limit of 28,392, with seats for 12,675. A flame in 1984 halfway devastated one of the stands which in the end prompted its total decimation and supplanting by 1987 with another City Stand. When it opened, at that point administrator Robert Chase looked at the experience of visiting the new remain to "heading off to the theater â the main distinction being that our stage is secured with grass". 

After the Hillsborough debacle in 1989 and the consequent result of the Taylor Report in 1990, the arena was changed over to all-seater. In 2003 the South Stand was supplanted by the new, 8,000-situate Jarrold Stand. In the late spring of 2010, work was embraced to expand the ground's ability from 26,018 to 27,000. This was accomplished by finding extra limit with respect to seats inside the current stands. 

In 2004, Â£700,000 was put resources into improving the pitch. The previous all-grass surface was supplanted with a sand-based Desso GrassMaster one, the blend of fake and genuine grass which, as per the then groundsman Gary Kemp "guarantee[d] that the pitch would look adequate for each match to be communicated on TV". The under-soil warming framework "can clear snow and ice inside eight hours of being turned on". 

Fully expecting the ground's 80th commemoration on 31 August 2015, a rematch of the first installation versus West Ham was played on 28 July. As a major aspect of the festivals, the club offered season ticket holders the chance to stamp their seats with their name or a message. Fans were additionally offered the opportunity to purchase tickets for a celebratory supper with the primary group squad, the menu given by the club's joint larger part investor, the VIP culinary specialist Delia Smith.

The exchange off is among limit and cost. I've had a few discussions with individuals saying 'it's getting somewhat costly Alan' and I realize it is. I think the undeniable course is the Geoffrey Watling stand, regardless of whether you put another layer on it or bring it down and re-construct, I don't have the foggiest idea. Most likely the reasonable activity is do what needs to be done, bring it down and construct another stand, however it implies 18 to two years without income and the general population in that stand will in general be the general population who have been the supporters for some ages.
