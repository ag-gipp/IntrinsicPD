To take this position, he surrendered as leader of the Surabaya part of Muhammadiyah and as a city chamber part. 

On 9Â March 1942 Governor-General Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer and leader of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army General Hein ter Poorten abdicated to the Empire of Japan, which had attacked the Indies the prior month. Therefore, the Indies fell under Japanese control. The Japanese prohibited all types of associations, and the MIAI was disbanded in May. It was transformed on 5 September 1942 after a gathering of 30 ulamas in the Des Indes Hotel in Jakarta, and was perceived by the occupation government as the sole Islamic association in the nation. Toward the finish of 1943, the association was renamed the Council of Indonesian Muslim Associations (, or Masyumi).

Hasyim was kept on as clergyman of religious issues, with Fakih delegated executive of religious instruction. 

In the interim, the distinctive groups in Masyumi were in strife over the way the gathering was taking; the NU individuals thought Masyumi was winding up excessively political, forsaking its Islamic roots. At the point when the Natsir Cabinet started to fall, the Masyumi set forth Fakih as a potential Minister for Religious Affairs. This demonstration was questionable on the grounds that four of the five distributed openings for the gathering were at that point filled by non-NU individuals, and at last the NU hauled out of Masyumi, viable 5Â April 1952.

In 1956 he was one of three Muhammadiyah individuals who displayed their idea of a genuinely Islamic culture, one which underscored social instruction. Amid this time he was progressively dynamic with Masyumi, and after the 1955 Constituent Assembly race, Fakih was made an individual from the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia. This get together, intended to achieve an understanding for another national constitution, neglected to pick up an agreement, and was disbanded by president Sukarno with his declaration of 5 July 1959.

The disbanding of Masyumi left Fakih with more opportunity to concentrate on the Muhammadiyah, filling in as the Second Deputy Chair under Junus Anis. Amid an initiative course kept running by the association amid Ramadhan of 1380 AH (February/March 1961), Fakih started advancing an institutional personality through his address "Apakah Muhammadiyah Itu" ("What is Muhammadiyah?"). This illustrated the association as one situated in dawah, concentrating on certifiable issues, and willing to work with the administration to guarantee a prosperous future for Muslims. These ideas were later figured through 1962 and built up as an institutional personality, one which called for Muhammadiyah to progress in the direction of making a genuinely Islamic culture while restricting liberal governmental issues. This, thusly, was trailed by refactoring inside the association to all the more likely adjust the new character. 

From 1962 until 1965 Fakih filled in as the First Deputy Chair of Muhammadiyah under Ahmad Badawi, giving direction to youthful religious pioneers. Amid the killings and power move which pursued the 30 September Movement overthrow endeavor, Fakih and a few Muhammadiyah individuals sent a letter mentioning that Masyumi be permitted to change; this consent was not conceded.
