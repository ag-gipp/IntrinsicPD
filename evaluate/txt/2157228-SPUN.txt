The destitution Beattie originated from was apparent when he touched base in Ipswich wearing his dad's shoes, so when Ipswich marked him, they promptly gotten him some garments. As an adolescent, he played as a striker, however Robson changed over him into a protector, more often than not an inside a large portion of; the player said in later life that the move fit him well, as it implied he could see all the play before him. 

Presently acquiring a compensation, Beattie attempted to help bolster his family, sending cash home every week.

In the arrival apparatus at Stoke's Victoria Ground, Beattie's colleague Allan Hunter was associated with an episode that left Stoke's Denis Smith with a broken leg. The group ejected in resentment, coordinated at Beattie; Robson noted "There was a cauldron for 20 minutes. Kevin Beattie needed to beat 28,000 individuals out there."

As indicated by Beattie, "the supervisor furtively disclosed to me that on the off chance that I felt fit enough to play, at that point I was in". Robson did not report the Cup last group until the latest possible time: it incorporated a development change to incorporate five midfielders and Paul Mariner as a solitary striker â and Beattie in barrier. Roger Osborne's late objective for Ipswich was the main score of the diversion, and they won the trophy. Beattie had three cortisone infusions to traverse the last. Following the glass last achievement, he and colleagues Robin Turner and David Geddis were granted the opportunity of Carlisle.

Beattie resigned because of damage in December 1981, after five knee tasks in four years. His tribute amusement occurred in March 1982, against a Dynamo Moscow XI. 

In the off-period of 1982, Beattie started preparing with Norwich City under chief Ken Brown who offered him a transient contract. The offer was before long pulled back on the grounds that Ipswich were hesitant to discharge Beattie to their neighborhood rivals. Rather, he joined another East Anglian group, Colchester United, whose player-chief was Beattie's previous partner, Allan Hunter. Beattie showed up for the club, yet when partner John Lyons ended it all, Hunter surrendered, and Beattie chose to proceed onward. He marked for Middlesbrough, where he showed up amid that season, scoring once, a punishment, in a 2â 0 FA Cup triumph over Notts County.

Subsequent to neglecting to verify any training work, Beattie took up work as a worker, and joined nearby group Harwich and Parkeston to enhance his salary. Tolerating an idea from Ipswich's previous scout Ron Gray, Beattie joined Swedish second-level side Sandvikens IF under supervisor and previous Swedish global player, Thomas Nordahl. Before long, Nordahl all of a sudden surrendered and the club let Beattie go. He moved to Norway, marking for fourth division club Kongsberg IF, where he scored in excess of 60 objectives in his first season.

His last training position was a short spell with Barry Fry at Peterborough United. 

Previous Ipswich chief and afterward England supervisor Alf Ramsey chose Beattie to speak to the England under-23 group amid the 1972â 73 English residential season. He made his introduction in November 1972 against Wales under-23s at Vetch Field in Swansea, winning 3â 0. His last diversion additionally observed his solitary objective at that dimension, in a 2â 0 triumph, by and by over Wales, this time at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham. 

Beattie's senior England debut went under Don Revie, a beginning job in a 5â 0 triumph over Cyprus at Wembley in April 1975, particularly prominent for Malcolm Macdonald scoring every one of the five objectives. Beattie figured out how to put the ball in the net, however the objective was refused for a foul on the goalkeeper; eventually, the main objective he scored for his nation was in May 1975, amid a 5â 1 triumph over Scotland in the 1974â 75 British Home Championship. Perry Groves, who played close by Beattie at Colchester United, depicts how Beattie, apparently playing at left-back, developed to meet a cross from Kevin Keegan, beat two Scottish safeguards and "circled an incredible header" into the objective, casted a ballot one of the main 50 objectives England have scored. His last diversion for England was in October 1977 against Luxembourg in a capability coordinate for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Altogether, he earned nine tops somewhere in the range of 1975 and 1977, scoring once. 

Beattie was prestigious for his quality, the epithet "Monster" mirroring that, yet additionally his quality on the ball (with the resultant other moniker of "Precious stone"). Robson portrayed him as "the fastest safeguard I at any point saw ... with a left foot like a howitzer". Perry Groves noticed that Beattie's solitary inadequacy seemed, by all accounts, to be his powerlessness to toss the ball far. At the point when Beattie touched base at Colchester, "into his thirties" and with his knees "all shot", "he was as yet the speediest player at the club more than ten yards by far." Groves reviews Robson's synopsis of Beattie's qualities as a player: 

What a player the kid was... He could move higher than the crossbar and still head the ball down. He had the best left foot I've at any point seen and could hit 60-yard goes, without looking, that disposed of six resistance players from the diversion. He had the quality of a tank, was lightning speedy and he could handle. 

Amid his years with Ipswich, Beattie framed a focal protective organization with Allan Hunter. Robson portrayed them as 'Bacon and eggs'. Met in 2018, Hunter discussed their association: 

we just gelled and on the off chance that I proceeded to get things done to assault the ball he was constantly behind me â and the other way around. We didn't have to work at it since it was something that fell into place without a hitch ... We were only a decent association ... me and Beat would sit on the opposite side of a room from one another and we would know what the other was supposing in light of the fact that there were times I would, or he would, blasted out giggling and the young men would state, what you grisly snickering at? What's more, we would state "tend to your very own concerns" ... It helped on the field since we didn't need to talk since we knew each other's play. 

In December 1974, Beattie was associated with an occurrence that incited paper features over the quality and newspaper press. Called up to speak to England at under-23 level against Scotland under-23s at Pittodrie, Beattie was "put on the correct train by his chief Bobby Robson", yet neglected to touch base in Manchester. That Beattie was "discovered" playing dominoes with his dad in a bar in Carlisle offered legs to the story, in spite of the fact that England administrator Don Revie sent Beattie a message wishing him a cheerful birthday, the next day. Forests' record, after 30 years, is that when Beattie's train maneuvered into Carlisle station, he saw the name, felt pining to go home and went to visit his dad. Media inclusion at the time credited Beattie's omissions to weight, factors refered to including his then four-week-old little girl, his clothes to newfound wealth climb and an infection. Ensuing reports that he at that point missed preparing for Ipswich, purportedly liking to remain in bed when passed fit by the club specialist, fuelled the story further. Ipswich suspended him for one match. 

Beattie acknowledged a lit cigarette from a fan and smoked it while gathering his FA Cup victor's award in 1978. As indicated by Groves, Beattie smoked 20 cigarettes every day for the length of his playing vocation; he additionally missed piece of pre-season for Colchester on the grounds that he "stressed excessively" while crapping, bringing about a pulled stomach muscle. 

Beattie was jobless on a few events in the wake of completing his playing profession. Forests expounds on how the joblessness office where Beattie would sign on was so near Ipswich's home ground that he would see players touching base in their "streak engines", while he marked signatures. In the wake of running a bar, he started drinking in all respects vigorously and was on one event given the last ceremonies when his pancreas "stuffed up". He thought about suicide, however had the capacity to think about his significant other who was genuinely unwell, and, as per Groves, figured out how to recover "his life back destined for success". Regardless, Beattie ended up ruined, and in spite of getting Â£50,000 from a tribute coordinate sorted out by Ipswich Town, he relied upon money related assistance from the Professional Footballers' Association. In later years, Beattie worked for communicate media: he remarked on football for BBC Radio Suffolk until the day preceding his demise. He likewise co-composed his collection of memoirs, "The Beat", distributed in 1998. In May 2012, Beattie was sentenced for advantage extortion and allowed a 12-week check in time. He had neglected to unveil his profit from radio, because of a paranoid fear of losing Income Support. He later apologized and depicted it as a "senseless mix-up".

They were hitched in 1974, and not long after she showed up in the "Radio Times" in a "Footballers' Wives" include; by then the couple were all the while living in an "unobtrusive" club-claimed house. Amid the mid-1980s, Maggie was determined to have various sclerosis and later limited to a wheelchair, with Beattie as her carer in their committee claimed home. They had three girls, Emma, Sarah and Louise. 

His playing vocation wounds gave Beattie troubles in later life: when he was 53 he was "unfit to walk the greater part a mile", because of the joint inflammation in his knees. He would not bow to his challenges: "Maggie, favor her, never grumbles", he said to a "Day by day Telegraph" columnist, "so for what reason would it be a good idea for me to feel any outrage at how life turned out?". On 16 September 2018, Beattie passed on of an associated heart assault at the age with 64. He was made due by his significant other and girls. His burial service was held at the crematorium at Nacton on 26 October 2018. Previous Ipswich and England player Terry Butcher paid tribute to Beattie, calling him "the total footballer" and portraying his left-footed shot as an "Exocet". George Burley alluded to Beattie as "a legend", while John Wark, whose moniker for Beattie was "Beast", portrayed him as the best-ever Ipswich player. 

Beattie was once depicted by Bobby Robson as the best England player he had seen, and that he could have matched Duncan Edwards. Beattie was accepted into the Ipswich Town Hall of Fame in 2008, was casted a ballot various occasions as Ipswich Town's "best ever player", and highlights as one of Perry Groves' 20 "Football Heroes" in a book distributed in 2009. 

Alongside a portion of his Ipswich colleagues, Beattie included in the 1981 film "Departure to Victory". His aptitudes were appeared on the pitch as the body twofold for Michael Caine's POW character, and the two progressed toward becoming companions. Beattie had a cooler association with Sylvester Stallone, who additionally featured in the film: "There weren't an excessive number of that jumped on that well with him and after I beat him in an arm wrestle â first my correct arm and afterward my left â he didn't address me once more".
