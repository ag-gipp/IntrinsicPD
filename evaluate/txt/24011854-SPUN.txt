In spite of the fact that Mellor has not had an artistic creation hung in the Archibald Prize, he was the subject of Paul Ryan's picture that was a 2010 finalist in that challenge.

During the 2010s, Mellor wound up associated with authoritative and influential positions in human expressions network. In 2010, he turned into an individual from the Visual Arts Board of the Australia Council for the Arts. In 2011, Mellor was not a contestant in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award, as he rather ended up one of its judges. Named to the Visual Arts Board for a further term, Mellor in 2013 turned into its Chair. In the meantime, Mellor kept on showing works. In 2014, an overview of his works opened at the University of Queensland Art Museum, and was planned to make a trip to the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory later in the year. The presentation was positively investigated in theguardian.com, with workmanship faultfinder Sharne Wolff attracting regard for Mellor's most current figure, "Anima", which she said "marks a sensational change" for the craftsman, bearing "no similarity to Mellor's progressively fabulous yield". His work highlighted as a feature of the Edinburgh International Festival, with a show titled "Primordial: SuperNaturalBayiMinyjirral" showed at the National Museum of Scotland. 

An extensive work of Mellor's, "Entelekheia" (2016), comprising of photographic pictures of plants carved in cement, can be found on the outside dividers of the International Convention Center in Sydney. 

Mellor's broad insightful craftsmanship instruction has prompted his specialty having a solid hypothetical base. In meetings he has recognized the impact of differing craftsmen, including Indigenous painter Rover Thomas, Australian Sulman Prize victor Tim Storrier, Romantic painters including Germany's Caspar David Friedrich, and contemporary German specialists Joseph Beuys, and Beuys' understudy Anselm Kiefer. He has outfit a wide scope of media amid his vocation, including printmaking, drawing, painting and model using wood, glass, steel and earthenware production, just as a scope of progressively irregular materials, as his 2007 Indigenous Art Triennial passage illustrated. Thinking about that mold, "Artlink Magazine's" analyst, Daniel Thomas, commented on how the work implied "how colonizers dependably misunderstand things; what Europeans looking like for China, and its fine porcelain makes, faltered rather upon the place where there is the kangaroo, and exchanged and planted thoughts of racial and social predominance". 

At the point when Sarah Scott considered the 2008 work "Fascinating Lies and Sacred Ties", which, as "From Rite to Ritual", drew on summonings of Spode china, she featured its investigation of the historical backdrop of multifaceted relations. Taking note of the scene that shapes the focal component of the work of art, she watched: 

"From Rite to Ritual" inspected connections among Indigenous and pilgrim societies, incorporating contrasts in profound practices. Mellor, in a craftsman's announcement for the honors, portrayed the work as demonstrating "what is a snapshot of contact, a discussion and cooperation between two societies; it talks about the difficulties of settlement, and the distinctions in profound establishment and conviction". Remarking on the work, the judges of the prize commented that the "amazing scale and layering of symbolism, with its downplayed political and chronicled references" made the work "extraordinary" and of "incredible unpredictability and elegance". Craftsmanship essayist Nicolas Rothwell portrayed the work as illustration a parallel "between Aboriginal inception customs and the functions inside a Masonic cabin." 

Mellor's prior works inspected the connections between societies, incorporating into his mezzotint prints in which he compared "pictures of local and presented widely varied vegetationâfor instance, a kangaroo with a bullâto symbolize two distinct people groups and societies". These issues were additionally tended to in his artwork for the display "Local Titled Now", appeared South Australia in 1996. Mellor's enthusiasm for social cooperations stretches out past the creation of his specialty. In a board exchange on Indigenous workmanship training, Mellor underscored that, in showing Indigenous craftsmanship inside visual expressions, it was essential to know about both Aboriginal and pilgrim history, "so you can discuss their communication and the entire arrangement of issues that emerge from those two things being parallel". Mellor's accentuation on past collaborations between societies drove gallerist and faultfinder Michael Reid to think about that Mellor's works had earned him "a vital spot in the visual story of Australian history". 

For Mellor, Indigenous character is a topic featured both in his work and (not really by his own decision) in open life. As a reasonable cleaned man with blue eyes and caucasian highlights, his appearance has incidentally brought up issues of "credibility". Mellor got himself the objective of reporter Andrew Bolt, who disagreed with Mellor entering and winning the 2009 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Jolt stated "This white college speaker, with his pleasant Canberra studio, has by winning pushed aside genuine attract the-soil Aboriginal craftsmen, for example, Dorothy Napangardi, Mitjili Napanangka Gibson and Walangkura Napanangka, who had additionally entered and could truly have utilized that money and acknowledgment." Commentator Ellie Savage, scrutinizing Bolt, asked why somebody who "neither attracts the earth nor lives in it" ought to subsequently reserve "no privilege to enter rivalries for Indigenous specialists". Jolt two years after the fact lost a case brought by nine Indigenous Australiansâexcluding Mellorâfor racial segregation over articles that censured reasonable cleaned Indigenous individuals, including the post that had thrashed Mellor. Craftsmanship essayist Maurice O'Riordan, inspecting the 2009 Award, noticed the Bolt debate, yet called attention to that Mellor, while in early works recognizing his own Indigenous legacy, isn't worried about the meaning of Aboriginality, however with authentic collaboration among societies and the reconsidering of history.
