Worked amid the approach of Googie design, its Polynesian Tiki-themed styling reached out from the huge roadside sign to the structure's neon lights and misrepresented rooflines. 

At the point when Kona Lanes was crushed in 2003, it was one of the final instances of the Googie style in the locale; its sister focus, Java Lanes in Long Beach, was flattened in 2004.

Creator Andrew Hurley called them "costly and appealing structures that shouted, 'Have some good times here, and Kona held quite a bit of that climate throughout the years. Its enormous neon-lit road sign stayed for the life of the structure, and Kona was the main bowling foundation in the region to dismiss programmed scoring gear all through its reality. 

Kona Lanes facilitated the Southern California PBA Open twice in 1964; Billy Hardwick won in April and Jerry Hale in December.

At its pinnacle, Kona Lanes arrived at the midpoint of in excess of 80 lines on every one of its 40 paths. 

Bowling as a support sport prospered in the mid 1960s, yet its prevalence was weakened due to overbuilding; the quantity of bowling alleys endorsed by the then-American Bowling Congress topped at around 11,000 by mid-decade, and Kona was one of more than 30 in southern California alone. A decrease allied bowling beginning during the 1980s was additionally accused for the downturn, however an AMF Bowling official contended that the client base stayed unfaltering in light of the fact that an expansion in open bowling compensated for less group bowlers. 

Jack Mann purchased Kona Lanes in 1980 and re-marked it New Kona Lanes the next year. Mann's family claimed a few bowling focuses in the locale; he was behind the formation of Fountain Bowl in 1973 and the fleeting Regal Lanes in Orange in 1974.

An arranged occasion highlighting a neighborhood punk shake amass was closed somewhere around the Costa Mesa Police Department, prompting negative exposure. 

Kona Lanes kept on losing business to fresher focuses, in spite of endeavors to speak to an increasingly assorted client base by facilitating nearby music acts, supporting a Polynesian-themed eatery called Kona Korral, and advancing contrivances like "naked bowling". In the end, the property turned out to be more significant than the business. The landowners, C.J. Segerstrom and Sons, gave Jack Mann Jr. a decision: burn through $10â 20 million to refresh the middle, or surrender it. Mann picked the last as opposed to spend such a total on a site without a long haul rent. 

Plans to construct a Kohl's retail chain on the site involved by Kona Lanes and the officially shut Edwards Cinema Center and Ice Capades Chalet were affirmed by the city's arranging magistrates, however they were met with opposition by neighbors who did not trust the store was a solid match for the region. At that point city hall leader Karen Robinson grumbled that Costa Mesa's arrangement creators were disposing of entertainment as a component of the nature of inhabitants' lives, and requested the chiefs' choice in February 2003. The city committee later rejected the proposition. The proceeding with endeavors to spare Kona Lanes fizzled; it shut for good in May 2003 and was crushed before long. 

The 7.5-section of land bundle was rezoned in 2010 for senior lodging that was relied upon to give another client base to the eateries and retailers as of now in the zone and for business advancements still to come.

Chief Juanita Johnson said individuals were requesting to purchase furniture, office gear, and the sky is the limit from there. "A portion of that is more established than I am." The more generous things, including the first wood paths, had been sold off before annihilation, while dumpster jumpers hit the parking garage every day, searching for any things of intrigue. 

The loss of Kona Lanes was a rehashed theme at political occasions. One Costa Mesa city board applicant said he made a guarantee to open administration when the structure was torn down with little obstruction. Another future committee part concurred that the decimation ought to never have occurred. 

In 2012, Costa Mesa made arrangements to redesign The Triangle, a retail space along Harbor Boulevard two miles south of the Kona Lanes site. Those plans highlighted a 10-path bowling alley that opened in 2014. One city official said the middle addressed occupants' long-term require another, upscale bowling office.
