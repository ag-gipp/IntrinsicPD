Claire Farron, better known by the codename , is an anecdotal character from Square Enix's "Last Fantasy" arrangement. She originally showed up as a playable character and hero in the pretending computer game "Last Fantasy XIII", in which she includes as an inhabitant of the counterfeit universe of Cocoon. After her sister Serah is announced a foe of Cocoon, Lightning endeavors to spare her. She and others are then picked by the fal'Cie, a separated race of mythical beings who rule the universes of Gran Pulse and Cocoon, to demolish Cocoon. Lightning returns as a supporting character in "Definite Fantasy XIII-2", going about as defender of the Goddess Etro. She is the sole playable character in "", wherein she embarks to spare her reality, which is bound to finish in thirteen days. Outside the "XIII" arrangement, Lightning has been included in different "Last Fantasy" recreations and had appearance appearances in other computer games. 

Lightning was made by Motomu Toriyama, the executive and situation author of "XIII", and planned by Tetsuya Nomura, a customary character craftsman for the "Last Fantasy" arrangement. Their thought was to make a solid female hero who was proficient at battle and less ladylike than past "Definite Fantasy" courageous women. Parts of her initial plan and identity were later changed, or exchanged to different characters. After "XIII", Lightning's structure was changed a few times to mirror her job and advancement in each diversion, especially in "Lightning Returns". Her name in Japanese, , was initially a placeholder. Due to its similitude to the name of a cake, her first name was changed to "Claire" in different nations. 

Lightning has gotten blended analysis from punditsâquite a bit of it identifying with her chilly identity, which was contrasted with that of "Conclusive Fantasy VII's" hero Cloud Strife. She was scrutinized for her relative nonattendance in "XIII-2". Her job in "Lightning Returns" met with blended gathering: a few pundits considered her to be immature and unlikable, while others discovered her preferable created and increasingly human over in past amusements. Lightning later showed up on records, assembled by computer game productions, of the best characters in the "Last Fantasy" arrangement and in computer games overall. She has been gotten positively in surveys of general assessment by "Famitsu", Square Enix, and different associations. 

Lightning was made by Motomu Toriyama, the executive of "Conclusive Fantasy XIII". Her character configuration was by normal "Last Fantasy" craftsman Tetsuya Nomura, who had recently filled in as the character architect for "Definite Fantasy VIII" and "X". Nomura has said that various plansâincluding some by staff individuals other than himselfâwere considered for Lightning, while Toriyama has guaranteed that Nomura's first draft "looked so cool and solid that there was no requirement for any retakes." Because of the graphical limits of "Definite Fantasy XIII"s planned stages, Nomura had the capacity to incorporate unquestionably more detail in Lightning's structure than in his past character structures, for example, her cape and facial highlights. This required undeniably more exertion on his part. Remarking on an early type of her plan, Nomura clarified that she is basically a "cool character", in that she is not kidding and unforgiving. Be that as it may, he couldn't make the character unreasonably manly because of a paranoid fear of losing player sympathy. Attributes from prior variants of the plan included light or silver hair and Asian-looking facial highlights. Her last workmanship was made less Asian-looking than these early drafts and her hair shading changed to pink, while Hope Estheim was given silver hair. Lightning's last hair shading and hairdo were expected to mirror her womanliness, and to offset her athletic body. Making her limited time CG render was genuinely simple because of the quantity of subtleties accessible concerning her. 

Lightning's genuine name is Claire Farron in English and in Japanese. Amid the beginning periods of generation, Lightning's genuine name was Averia: "Eclair" was utilized to keep this name mystery, yet it was in the end picked as her official name. Her English name, Claire, was picked on the grounds that the name "Eclair" is intently connected with a kind of cake. The name "Lightning" was not picked by Nomura but rather by different individuals from the improvement group: Nomura had needed to desert the convention of naming "Last Fantasy" heroes after climate occasions, and was shocked by the decision. A few models of Lightning's home were built for "XIII" yet were expelled because of space issues. Her weapon in "XIII", the Blazefire Saber (known as in the Japanese form) was intended to reflect the capacity of the diversion's brought beasts, the Eidolons, to change into creature , human-and vehicle-like shapes. The diversion's form of Odin, Lightning's Eidolon and a common gathered beast in the "Last Fantasy" arrangement, was proposed to introduce Lightning as a knight on horseback. He was composed as a dad figure for Lightning. In later recreations in the "XIII" arrangement, Odin was formed into a companion to whom Lightning could demonstrate her more profound emotions. Daisuke Watanabe, while composing the content for "XIII", gave specific consideration to fleshing out Lightning's non-sentimental association with Snow Villiers and to demonstrating her advancement as an individual while ensuring Hope. 

Because of worldwide interest and the advancement staff's craving to encourage Lightning's character, improvement started for a continuation of "XIII". The amusement handles the subject of in the case of Lightning is cheerful after the occasions of "XIII". Indeed, even before a spin-off was greenlit, Toriyama had needed to make a really upbeat consummation for the character. Lightning's outfit in "XIII-2" was planned by Isamu Kamikokuryo. He worked from an unpleasant sketch by Nomura of how Lightning ought to show up. Nomura "contended energetically" to make the draft structure. The outfit was revamped a few times by Kamikokuryo: a qipao and a sci-fi enlivened structure were both disposed of in light of the fact that they conflicted with the amusement's climate. The last plan was motivated by the valkyries of Norse folklore. The outfit was intended to mirror nature around Lightning. It includes a quill theme to speak to Lightning's light, sensitive side and her developing forces. She was delineated as having risen above her human cutoff points, making it hard to portray her as an ordinary individual. 

Her outfit in "Lightning Returns" was structured by Nomura. He was advised by Toriyama to make something illustrative of her last fight, with "quality" as the primary rule. The resultant outfit, which looks like a cowhide bodysuit, has spinal section designs on its sleeves and is essentially hued red and white. Nomura later remarked that he felt "a solid response inside [himself]" while making Lightning's last look. Nomura's structure was Kamikokuryo's most loved out of the numerous outfits made for the character. Her different outfits for the diversion were structured by Kamikokuryo, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Toshitaka Matsuda: huge numbers of them drew motivation from the character plans of standard "Last Fantasy" craftsman Yoshitaka Amano. Notwithstanding the new ensembles, Lightning's in-amusement demonstrate was modified starting from the earliest stage. Her bosoms were developed and a few of her outfits were intended to introduce her in a progressively ladylike manner. For the diversion's epilog, Toriyama wanted for Lightning to show up in an ordinary setting and typical garments. The group thought about completion the amusement with Lightning either meeting or talking with her partners, however Toriyama wished the story to start and finish with her alone. He has guaranteed that Lightning, with her performance job in "Lightning Returns", was the "Last Fantasy" arrangement's "first female hero". 

Toriyama needed Lightning to be a sort of female character already concealed in "Definite Fantasy" diversions, one with a competitor's body and a less ladylike nature. His rule to Nomura was to make her solid, delightful, and "like a female variant of Cloud Strife from "Conclusive Fantasy VII"". Remarking on the likeness, Toriyama expressed that the similitudes between the characters just stretch out to their chilly identities and their military foundations, and that something else "Lightning truly [is] her very own individual." Nomura looked at the two without further ado before the Japanese arrival of "Lightning Returns", saying that he had "wanted for her to be deliberately created and adored for quite a while, similar to Cloud." Toriyama has said that, among the characters he had been associated with making, Lightning was his most loved female character from a computer game, close by Yuna from "Conclusive Fantasy X" and Yoyo from "Bahamut Lagoon". 

As opposed to different characters in the "Last Fantasy" arrangement, whose identity characteristics were formed to fit a story, Toriyama imagined Lightning's essential identity before "XIII"s account had been settled. She has a cool mien, which was intended to conflict in an engaging route with Snow's bluntness. Nomura remarked that Lightning has "a solid component of secret about her character". She initially had a coy viewpoint to her identity, which was exchanged to Oerba Yun Fang when Fang was changed from male to female. For "Lightning Returns", the engineers needed to depict Lightning in a few distinct lights, rather than her static identities in earlier appearances. One of their most noteworthy needs was to make Lightning a character who had lost much in her life and become profoundly powerless therefore. Fashioner Yuji Abe expounded that, due to her misfortunes and freshly discovered defenselessness, Lightning appeared to be darker, marginally desensitized to her environment, and "like a manikin, similar to somebody who doesn't exactly have her genuine self inside." He explained that this impact indicates "the sort of powerlessness she has, and it's the point from which she begins to change a short time later." The choice to extend her identity thusly was initially recommended by Yoshinori Kitase, who was worried that Lightning's coolness in past diversions had made it troublesome for players to bond with her. 

Over her talking appearances, Lightning is voiced by Ali Hillis in English and Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese. Sakamoto was awed by Lightning, whom she called "cold" and "solid". She was approached to depict Lightning's quality and to sell out the character's concealed vulnerabilities. She at first thought that it was weird to voice Lightning, as she was utilized to gentler jobs, for example, Aerith Gainsborough, a focal character in "Definite Fantasy VII" and its partner media. Remarking on the trouble of adjusting Lightning's portrayal as a lady and an expertly prepared warrior, Kitase noticed that Sakamoto's acting drew out Lightning's gentility. Hillis was given the job of Lightning subsequent to talking a couple of the character's lines amid tryout, and was then given a book about the "Last Fantasy XIII" universe, which she found a touch of "overpowering" when she read it. One of the difficulties Hillis confronted was recovering the feeling and vitality of Sakamoto's Japanese execution in the character's English interpretation. She endeavored to help the staff of the "XIII" amusements depict Lightning as a genuine individual: "I feel that was my fundamental need, to ensure that Lightning had each and every layer of her identity as an individual, a diversion character, however a genuine individual with layers and history and connections to each and every character in the game...even the Chocobo!" Over the course of the "XIII" set of three, Hillis felt that Lightning turns into "somewhat more snide ... somewhat more solidified to everything that is going on around her and ... [evolves] into a genuine warrior". 

Lightning, alongside her sister Serah, is an occupant of Cocoon, a counterfeit world floating over the planet Gran Pulse. Every one of these districts is constrained by a group of the fal'Cie, a race of diving beings whose two groups, the "Sanctum" populace on Cocoon and the "Beat" fal'Cie from Gran Pulse, are antagonistic toward each other.
