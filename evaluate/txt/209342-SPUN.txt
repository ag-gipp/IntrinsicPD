Catopsbaatar 

Catopsbaatar is a family of multituberculate, a wiped out request of rat like well evolved creatures. It lived in what is presently Mongolia amid the late Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous Period, around 72 million years back. The main fossils were gathered in the mid 1970s, and the creature was named as another types of the family "Djadochtatherium " in 1974, "D. catopsaloides". The particular name alludes to the creature's similitude to the sort "Catopsalis". The species was moved to the family "Catopsalis" in 1979, and got its own class ("Catopsbaatar", Greek and Mongolian for "unmistakable saint") in 1994. Five skulls, one molar, and one skeleton with a skull are known; the last is the class' most finished example. "Catopsbaatar" was an individual from the family Djadochtatheriidae. 

The skull of "Catopsbaatar" was up to long and, as in different multituberculates, relatively substantial. The outer appearance of their heads may have been like those of rodents. The skull was pudgy and wide, with the zygomatic curves emphatically extended to the sides. The eye attachments were littler and set further back than in its relatives, and the nose was increasingly lengthened. "Catopsbaatar" had half circle edges in favor of the skull, to which the jaw muscles were appended. The mandible was solid and extended. It had hearty incisors, and cheek teeth with different cusps (for which multituberculates are named). The pelvic bones varied from those of different multituberculates in that they were not intertwined to one another. "Catopsbaatar" had goads on its lower legs, similar to those of the male platypus and echidna, without proof of a venom waterway (present in the previous). 

The goads of "Catopsbaatar" and other Mesozoic warm blooded animals may have been utilized for security against theropod dinosaurs and different predators. Multituberculates are thought to have given live birth, and the way that they had hair shows that they were homeothermic ("warmblooded"). Multituberculates would have been omnivorous; "Catopsbaatar" had incredible jaw muscles, and its incisors were all around adjusted for biting hard seeds, utilizing a regressive biting stroke. Multituberculates are thought to have had a rambling stance, and "Catopsbaatar" may have had the capacity to hop. "Catopsbaatar" is known from the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav and the Barun Goyot Formation in Mongolia, which are believed to be the equivalent geologic age (around 72 million years of age). 

In 1970 and 1971, the Polish-Mongolian Palaeontological Expeditions gathered mammalian fossils from the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav development in Mongolia's Gobi Desert. Around 100 examples, recuperated from four localitions, are housed at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw. 66% of the gathered examples were multituberculates: a wiped out request of warm blooded creatures with rat like dentition, named for the various cusps (or tubercles) on their molars. In 1974, Polish scientist Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska named another types of the Mongolian multituberculate family "Djadochtatherium" as "D. catopsaloides", with example ZPAL MgMâI/78 from the Polish gathering as the holotype. The particular name alludes to the creature's likeness toward the North American species "Catopsalis joyneri", which Kielan-Jaworowska thought was a conceivable relative. The example, gathered at the Hermiin Tsav I area, is a nearly total skull of an adolescent with parts of the head harmed. Kielan-Jaworowska additionally relegated different examples to the species: a harmed skull missing lower jaws (ZPAL MgMâI/79, a grown-up), a skull with incomplete lower jaws (ZPAL MgMâI/80), and a molar with a section of jaw (ZPAL MgMâI/159 from the Barun Goyot Formation of Khulsan, the main example not from Hermiin Tsav). 

Kielan-Jaworowska and American scientist Robert E. Sloan considered the family "Djadochtatherium" a lesser equivalent word of "Catopsalis", and made the new mix "C. catopsaloides" in 1979. American scientistss Nancy B. Simmons and Miao Desui led a 1986 cladistic investigation which showed that "Catopsalis" was a paraphyletic taxon (an unnatural gathering of species), and "C. catopsaloides" required its own conventional name. Kielan-Jaworowska pursued Simmons and Miao's proposal, moving "C. catopsaloides" to its own monotypic class ("Catopsbaatar") in 1994. "Catops" is gotten from the Greek word "katoptos" ("unmistakable" or "apparent"); "baatar" is Mongolian for "saint", and the name alludes to "Catopsbaatar's" comparability to the class "Catopsalis" (just like the case for the particular name). The name "Catopsalis" itself comprises of the Greek words for "unmistakable" and "cutting shears" ("psalis"). 

Later in 1994, Kielan-Jaworowska and the Russian scientist Petr P. Gambaryan referenced caudal (tail) vertebrae which may have had a place with "Catopsbaatar"; this attribution is questionable, since they may rather have a place with the related "Tombaatar" (named in 1997). A fourth skull (PIN 4537/4, an adolescent), found amid the 1975 SovietâMongolian Expedition, was referenced by Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska in 1995. Canadian palaontologist Phillip J. Currie found another "Catopsbaatar" example amid the 1999 Dinosaurs of the Gobi endeavor, composed by the American Nomadic Expeditions Company. Housed at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in Ulaanbaatar as PM120/107, this most totally protected realized example comprises of the total skull (which might be somewhat smoothed) and incomplete skeleton of a grown-up person. The example has rather total fore-and rear appendages, which were obscure for the sort up to that point and which are commonly once in a while saved in multituberculates. Its pelvic ilia were stolen and wrecked by a student on visit at the Natural History Museum of Oslo, when it was set up in 2000. The example was accounted for in 2002 by Kielan-Jaworowska, Norwegian scientist JÃ¸rn Hurum, Currie and Mongolian scientist Rinchen Barsbold, who likewise referenced another skull (PIN 4537/5, an adolescent) discovered amid the 1975 endeavor. "Catopsalis joyneri", the premise of the name "C. catopsaloides", was moved to the new family "Valenopsalis" in 2015. 

"Catopsbaatar" had a place with the request Multituberculata, a gathering inside Allotheria (an infraclass of vertebrates outside Theria, the gathering that contains current placentals and marsupials). Multituberculates are portrayed by having premolars and molars with different low cusps, masterminded in longitudal lines. Multituberculates are the best-known gathering of warm blooded animals from the Mesozoic Era, when the dinosaurs commanded; in spite of the fact that the most punctual multituberculate remains are from the Jurassic Period, the gathering is referred to as of late as the Eocene Epoch (consequently enduring the Cretaceousâ Palaeogene termination occasion). The gathering may have turned out to be wiped out because of rivalry with eutherian vertebrates, for example, rodents. Multituberculates were for the most part known from teeth and jaws until the 1920s, when increasingly total examples were foundâfirst in Asia, and after that somewhere else. Postcranial bones (the remainder of the skeleton, other than the skull) stay uncommon. 

Kielan-Jaworowska initially classfied "Catopsbaatar" as an individual from the multituberculate family Taeniolabididae in 1974. In 1994, she proposed that "Djadochtatherium" was near "Catopsbaatar" family. She and Hurum named another group of multituberculates, Djadochtatheriidae (which they put in the new suborder Djadochtatheria), in 1997. The family incorporated the genera "Djadochtatherium", "Catopsbaatar", "Kryptobaatar", and "Tombaatar", all from the Gobi Desert. The family contrasts from different multituberculates (and different warm blooded creatures) in that the front edges of its nose were blended with the zygomatic curves (cheekbones), giving the nose a trapezoid shape when seen from above. When all is said in done, different vertebrates have noses where the side edges are bended internal before the zygomatic curves. Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum overhauled the higher positions inside Multituberculata in 2001, supplanting the suborder Djadochtatheria with the superfamily Djadochtatherioidea (set in the suborder Cimolodonta). 

The accompanying cladogram demonstrates the position of "Catopsbaatar" among different multituberculates as per Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum, 1997: 

The most total grown-up "Catopsbaatar" skull (example PM 120/107) is long and wide, with a lower jaw. By examination, the skull of the adolescent holotype (ZPAL MgMâI/78) is about long and wide, with a lower jaw. The biggest grown-up skull (ZPAL MgMâI/79) is long be that as it may, since it is inadequate, its different estimations are obscure. "Catopsbaatar" was bigger than its relatives, "Kryptobaatar" and "Djadochtatherium". Multituberculates had generally substantial skulls and short necks; their skulls were relatively more and more extensive than those of correspondingly estimated rodents and marsupials. The outside appearance of their heads may have been like those of rodents. 

The skull of "Catopsbaatar" was pudgy, with a wide edge over the front. It was shorter along the midline than along the edges, on the grounds that the nuchal peak at the back of the head bended inwards at the center, making an indention at the rear edge of the skull when seen from above. The zygomatic curves were firmly extended to the sides, with the skull width (over the curves) around 85 percent of the skull length. The front of the circles (eye attachments) were further back than in different djadochtatheriids, bringing about a progressively extended nose (65 percent of the skull length) and little circles. The premaxilla (front bone of the upper jaw) expanded under 66% of the length of the nose before the eyes, shorter than that of "Kryptobaatar". The premaxilla comprised of parts of the face and the sense of taste; djadochtatheriids had a premaxillary edge on the limit between the two (obvious when seeing the skull from underneath). The palatal piece of the premaxilla was inward, with numerous haphazardly orchestrated supplement foramina (openings). The nasal boneâwhich shaped the upper piece of the noseâwas moderately wide (getting to be more extensive towards the back), and its front was secured with unpredictably separated vascular foramina. The suture between the nasal and frontal bones was less pointed advances in the center than were those of "Catopsbaatar's" relatives. 

The maxilla (the principle part of the upper jaw) was broad, and shaped the greater part of the side of the nose. It contained all the upper teeth, with the exception of the incisors. The infraorbital foramina (openings at the lower front of the maxilla) were cut like in certain examples and adjusted in others, and differed in number from one to three. A standout amongst the most trademark highlights of the substance of "Catopsbaatar" was the extremely extensive front zygomatic edge on the sides of the upper jaw (a site for jaw-muscle connection). It was a lot higher than in different djadochtatheriids with the exception of "Djadochtatherium", from which it varied in that the edge was crescent instead of generally trapezoidal (other genera have circular edges). The front edge of the foremost zygomatic edge was thickened, which delivered a lump as an afterthought edge of the nose when seen from the side or more. The lower some portion of the suture between the maxilla and the squamosal bone reached out along the rear fringe of the foremost zygomatic edge. The palatal procedures of the maxilla framed the majority of the sense of taste. The real palatine foramina had shallow depressions reaching out forward. The postpalatine torus (a hard distension on the sense of taste) of "Catopsbaatar" was less noticeable than was that of "Tombaatar". The frontal bone was vast, and framed a large portion of the cranial rooftop. The suture between the frontal and parietal bones framed a U-molded part in the center which pointed in reverseâlike the condition in "Kryptobaatar" however less profound, with littler U-formed structures along the edges. This contrasted from "Djadochtatherium", which had a smaller V-molded suture between the frontal and parietal bones. 

The middle of the road zygomatic edge on the squamosal bone (likewise for jaw-muscle connection) was a lot littler and lower than the foremost zygomatic edge before it. "Catopsbaatar" contrasted from different djadochtatheriids in that the middle edge reached the foremost edge with its front edge. The back zygomatic edge at the lower back of the squamosal bone was the weakest of the three edges, and just set apart by a sorrow. The postorbital forms behind the circle on the parietal bone were long, and the parietal edges stretched out from the rear edge of the postorbital forms towards one another (however without coming to). The nuchal peak was exceptionally noticeable, and stretched out to the sides to shape "wings". The occipital plate was practically vertical and marginally curved, and was clouded by the nuchal peak when the skull was seen from above. In spite of the fact that not entirely saved, it is accepted that the occipital plate inclined back and upwards from the occipital condyles (as in certain relatives). The orbito-fleeting vascular framework inside the skull of "Catopsbaatar" did not vary much from those of related genera. 

"Catopsbaatar" mandible was powerful and extended. The diastema (hole between the front and cheek teeth) was curved, and reached out for 20 percent of the dentary bone (the primary bone of the lower jaw). Seen from over, the diastema framed a wide rack which slanted downwards on the inward side of the jaw. The little mental foramen was near the upper center edge of the diastema. The coronoid procedure of the mandible seems to have been moderately more and smaller than in different djadochtatherioideans. It was isolated from the alveolar procedure (where the teeth are contained) by a wide depression. The mandibular condyle (which enunciated with the skull) was marginally over the dimension of the molars. The front piece of the masseretic peak was noticeable, shaping a lump known as a masseretic projection. The heartiness of this peak and the nearness of the projection shifts among related genera. The masseteric fovea (pit) before the masseteric fossa was most likely more unmistakable than in different djadochtatherioids. Every 50% of the mandibular symphysis (where the two parts of the mandible associate) was formed like a topsy turvy tear. The pterygoid fossa on the inward side of the mandible was extremely expansive, and involved a large portion of the rear piece of the dentary. The lower some portion of this fossa had a limit, known as the pterygoideus rack. 

The dental equation (the quantity of teeth of each kind in the tooth line of a vertebrate) of "Catopsbaatar" was (two incisors, no canines, three premolars and two molars in half of the upper tooth column, and one incisor, no canines, two premolars and two molars in half of the lower). By correlation, the dental equation of people is . Every tooth in a warm blooded animal is assigned with a letter and number by position (I for incisor, C for canine, P for premolar, M for molar); the letters are promoted for the teeth of the upper jaw, yet not for those in the lower jaw. The cusp recipe demonstrates the course of action and number of cusps in sequential columns of a tooth, from the external to the inward side; each line is isolated by a colon. 

Being a cimolodont, "Catopsbaatar" did not have I1 incisors. The I2 upper-front incisors of "Catopsbaatar" were strong and had a forcefully restricted band of polish. The two incisors met marginally towards the center, contacting one another. The littler I3 incisor behind was cone-formed. The alveolus (tooth attachment) of "Catopsbaatar's" I3 incisor was shaped by the premaxilla, instead of the premaxilla and maxilla (not at all like in "Tombaatar"). The front upper premolars P1 and P3 were just present in adolescents (deciduous), vanishing (with their alveoli) in more seasoned people. P1 seems to have had two cusps, was single-established, and had a cone-like, obtuse crown. P3 was single-established and littler than P1. The cusp recipe of the P4 premolar was 5â4:1, the focal cusp being the biggest. The P4 of "Catopsbaatar" was practically trapezoidal fit as a fiddle (not at all like in "Djadochtatherium" and "Kryptobaatar", where it is sickle formed), littler, and lacking edges. "Catopsbaatar" additionally contrasted by just having three upper premolars, without the P2 (a component imparted to "Tombaatar"). Different warm blooded animals for the most part develop the loss of teeth toward the start or end of a tooth push, not in the center (as in multituberculates). The cusp recipe of the M1 molar was 5â6:5â6:4, with the internal edge stretching out around 75 percent of the tooth's length. The cusps of M1 were sharp and unworn in adolescents, however worn and sunken in more seasoned creatures. The cusp recipe of the M2 molar was 2:2â3:2â3. 

"Catopsbaatar" had a solitary lower pair of incisors, normal for multituberculates, which was exceptionally solid and compacted sideways. It had a forcefully restricted band of polish, and developed persistently. The p3 premolar was exceptionally little, and clung completely to the lower diastema under the bigger p4. The cutting edge like p4 was generally trapezoidal in side view, and had three cusps along the even upper edge and one cusp on the external posterior. The p4 did not have the edges on the external and inward side, as are available in different multituberculates. The m1 molar was practically symmetrical, and its cusp equation was 4:4, the measure of the cusps diminishing towards the back. The m2 had a cusp recipe of 2â3:2, most examples being 2:2. The cusps on the internal side were more extensive than those on the external side, the inward column of cusps was shorter than the external one, and the rear edge of the tooth was organized at a slant. 

The main "Catopsbaatar" example which saves the postcranial skeleton is PM120/107, which is fragmentary. It incorporates components which are obscure, or not completely saved, in different multituberculates. One lumbar vertebra (the fifth or 6th, from between the rib confine and the pelvis) had a spinous procedure which was strong in side view and long when seen from above. The clavicle was somewhat less bended than that of "Kryptobaatar" (looking like a twisted pole which broadened at each end), and estimated about . The upper piece of the scapulocoracoid was moderately wide in side view, and the lower part was extremely tight. It was most likely about long when complete. The saved piece of the humerus (upper arm bone) was about long. Its pole was triangular in cross-area, moderately slender when seen from above, and a large portion of its width was involved by the intertubercular groove. This section was delimited as an afterthought by the peak of the more noteworthy tubercle, whose center part framed the deltopectoral peak. The ulnar condyle, where the ulna of the lower arm enunciated with the humerus, was more conspicuous than the outspread condyle (where the sweep explained), oval, and delimited from the spiral condyle by a furrow. The sweep was about long, with a conspicuous head. Its pole was smooth, compacted start to finish, and oval in cross-segment. The ulna was compacted sideways, compliment than the sweep, and about long as safeguarded. 

The contact from the ischium to the ilium and pubis of the pelvis was not combined, and the front end of the ischium shaped a rugose suture. The pubis was generally triangular, with an unpleasant suture for the ilium above and a profound section for the ischium at the lower front. Example PM120/107's pelvic bones contrasted from those of different multituberculates in not being melded. The nearness of sutures in the pelvis of PM120/107 demonstrates that it was an adolescent, in spite of the fact that the skull seems grown-up; the importance of this inconsistency is obscure. The femur (thigh bone) was relatively like that of "Eucosmodon" and "Nemegtbaatar"â littler than the previous, however bigger than the last mentioned. The femur was heavy in respect to its length, and it might have been about long. The tibia of the lower leg was about long. Seen from behind the upper side, the tibia had a profound removal (depression) which might be normal for multituberculates. 

Dissimilar to most different multituberculates and different well evolved creatures, the calcaneus bone at the back of the foot had a short tuber calcanei (like some tree kangaroos), with an extended, iron block molded proximal procedure firmly twisted downwards and to the side. "Catopsbaatar" had an os calcaris bone on the inward side of its lower leg, a component likewise found in present day male monotremes (the platypus and the echidna) and other Mesozoic warm blooded creatures. The os calcaris bone was plate-like and rectangular in blueprint; as in monotremes, it bolstered the cornu calcaris in shaping a goad on the external side of the bone structure (bunch of foot bones). Dissimilar to with other Mesozoic well evolved creatures, these two components were not combined in multituberculates. The cornu calcaris was triangular, with a concavity in the center, and was long. The goad was smoothed, and was thicker at its combination with the os calcaris (where they associated through a few edges). As the goad of PM120/107 may have been moved from its unique position, it is obscure whether it confronted inwards (like in the platypus). Dissimilar to in the platypus, there was no impression of a trench for venom. The cornu calcaris of "Catopsbaatar" was solidified (transformed into bone) and would have been shrouded in keratin (the horny covering found in nails and feet). The cornu calcaris of the platypus comprises just of keratin, and is empty. 

Hurum, Zhe-Xi Luo, and Kielan-Jaworowska proposed in 2006 that the goads on the lower legs of Mesozoic well evolved creatures, (for example, "Catopsbaatar") were homologous with those of monotremes, and were a basal (or "crude") highlight lost by later therian warm blooded creatures. The male platypus utilizes the goad to convey venom from an organ, however it is obscure if the wiped out gatherings were venomous also. Mesozoic well evolved creatures were generally little (with exemptions, for example, the fox-sized "Repenomamus") and, in spite of the fact that they were too little to even think about being prey for vast theropod dinosaurs, littler theropods, substantial reptiles, crocodiles, and winged creatures could have benefited from them. For instance, well evolved creature jaws have been found in the stomach area of an example of the little theropod "Sinosauropteryx"; the jaws had a place with "Zhangheotherium", which additionally had goads, and the multituberculate "Sinobaatar". Since dinosaurs commanded Earth amid the Mesozoic, this period has been known as the "dim ages" of mammalian history. The goad, which would have been progressively compelling if venomous, was most likely utilized as a protective weapon by little, early vertebrates. It could likewise have been utilized amid intraspecific challenge or predation. 

The pelvic bones of "Catopsbaatar" example PM120/107 might not have been melded in light of the fact that combination happened late being developed, in light of the fact that it was an explicitly dimorphic element just happening in guys (unfused pelvic bones may have empowered extension of the birth trench in females), or pelvic combination might be an ordered distinction among "Catopsbaatar" and different multituberculates. Dissimilar to with different warm blooded creatures, the pelvis of multituberculates was exceptionally restricted; in other genera where the pelvis is known, every 50% of the pubis and ischium were combined, framing a bottom. The length and inflexibility of the bottom demonstrate that the pelvis couldn't have spread amid birth. Since there would be little space for the entry of an (egg-laying monotremes have wide ischial archs), Kielan-Jaworowska recommended in 1979 that multituberculates were viviparous (gave live birth) and that the babies were incredibly littleâlike those of marsupials. 

Hair, basically like that of current warm blooded animals and related with bones of the Mongolian multituberculate "Lambdopsalis", has been recognized in coprolites (fossilized defecation) of rapacious well evolved creatures from the Palaeocene Epoch. This demonstrates multituberculates had hair for protection, like present day vertebrates (and perhaps fossil well evolved creatures), a component presumably identified with homeothermy (warm-bloodedness). 

In spite of the fact that multituberculates were thought to have been carnivores or herbivores, since American scientist William A. Clemens and Kielan-Jaworowska proposed current rodent kangaroos as analogs for the gathering in 1979 they have been viewed as omnivores (benefiting from the two plants and creatures). Extraordinarily among warm blooded creatures, multituberculates utilized a retrogressive biting stroke which brought about the masticatory musclesâthe muscles which move the mandibleâbeing embedded more to the front than in different gatherings (counting rodents). Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska recreated the masticatory musculature of different multituberculates in 1995, and found that "Catopsbaatar" and its relatives had incredible masticatory musculature, because of their high zygomatic curves and extensive foremost and middle of the road zygomatic edges and coronoid forms. Their amazing incisors, with restricted groups of veneer, would have been very much adjusted to chewing and to cutting hard seeds (like rodents). Since it was bigger than some different multituberculates, "Catopsbaatar" would just need to open its mouth 25 degrees to smash hard seeds in width; a 40-degree expand would have caused separation. After the incisors cut, the premolars and molars would start to granulate with a "control stroke". 

As per Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska, the adjustment for smashing hard seeds once in a whileâas in "Catopsbaatar"â restricted the advantage of a low condylar procedure (which debilitates mandibular disengagement). The front and middle of the road zygomatic edges of the skull were the root of the shallow masseter muscle, which encourages biting. The partition of the starting point of this muscle into two sections and the adjusted muscle scars left by them are one of a kind among well evolved creatures to multituberculates. The masticatory muscles of multituberculates freely advanced highlights imparted to rodents and little herbivorous marsupials. Likewise with rodents, multituberculates may have been equipped for respective ruminationâwhere the two columns of teeth in the mandible play out a similar capacity at the same timeâand one-sided rumination (where the lines on one side are utilized). 

The appendage stance of multituberculates has been discussed. As indicated by certain analysts, they utilized a parasagittal position with the erect appendages under the body; others consider a rambling position more probable. Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum upheld the last hypothesis in 2006 dependent on the nearness of rear leg goads, an element they considered present just in rambling warm blooded animals. They brought up that every single early warm blooded creature safeguarded in lacustrine (lake) stores were packed start to finish, proposing a rambling position, though later vertebrates were protected on their flanks. Prior contentions for a rambling position incorporate profound pelvises and highlights of the legs. They additionally recommended that the feet of multituberculates would have been plantigrade (the bottom contacting the ground) very still, however digitigrade (the underside not contacting the ground) when bouncing and running rapidly; they rejected that the forelimbs of multituberculates and other early warm blooded creatures were more parasagittal than their hindlimbs. Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum delineated "Catopsbaatar" with plantigrade, rambling legs, with portable goads which pointed internal while getting ready for assault. 

In 2008, Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum recommended that the long spinous procedure on a "Catopsbaatar" vertebra and the long transverse procedures in "Nemegtbaatar" may show that some multituberculates were saltatorial (could hop). "Catopsbaatar" most likely had solid muscles appending to the tuber calcanei, which further backings the hopping speculation. In spite of the fact that it has been recommended that multituberculates were arboreal (lived in trees), most Asian taxa were likely earthbound; some others were fossorial, burrowing and living underground. 

All examples of "Catopsbaatar" are known from the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav development, aside from one molar from the Barun Goyot Formation. The arrangements are viewed as contemporary (of the equivalent geographical age), contain a significant number of similar creatures, and likely date to the late Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous Period (around 72 million years prior). The stone facies of the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav arrangement comprise of orange-shaded, thick-slept with sandstone, with a meager interbedding of light-hued residue stones and claystones. The stone facies of the Barun Goyot Formation are viewed as the consequence of a dry or semi-bone-dry condition, with aeolian (kept by wind) beds. 

Other known well evolved creatures from the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav incorporate the multituberculates "Nemegtbaatar", "Chulsanbaatar" and "Nessovbaatar", and the therians "Deltatheridium", "Asioryctes", and "Barunlestes". Dinosaurs incorporate "Ajancingenia", "Velociraptor", "Saichania", "Platyceratops", "Gobiceratops", and some uncertain theropods. Reptiles incorporate the turtle "Mongolemys", the reptiles "Gobinatus", "Tchingisaurus", "Prodenteia", "Gladidenagama" and "Phrynosomimus", and an uncertain crocodile. The frog "Gobiates" and a vague alexornithiform flying creature are likewise known. Ostracods incorporate "Limnocythere", "Cypridea", and "Eucypris".
