Task Brevity 

Task Brevity was a restricted hostile led in mid-May 1941, amid the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. Brought about by the president of the British Middle East Command, General Archibald Wavell, Brevity was planned to be a quick blow against feeble Axis forefront powers in the Sollumâ Capuzzoâ Bardia region of the fringe among Egypt and Libya. Despite the fact that the task got off to a promising begin, tossing the Axis central leadership into perplexity, the vast majority of its initial additions were lost to neighborhood counter-assaults, and with German fortifications being raced to the front the activity was canceled following one day. 

Egypt had been attacked by Libyan-based Italian powers in September 1940, yet by February of the next year a British counter-hostile had propelled well into Libya, wrecking the Italian Tenth Army all the while. English consideration at that point moved to Greece, which was under the risk of Axis attack. While Allied divisions were being occupied from North Africa, the Italians fortified their positions and were bolstered by the landing of the German "Afrika Korps" under "Generalleutnant" Erwin Rommel. Quickly attacking against his occupied and over-extended rival, by April 1941 Rommel had driven the British and Commonwealth powers in Cyrenaica back over the Egyptian fringe. Despite the fact that the battlefront presently lay in the outskirt zone, the port city of Tobrukâinside Libyaâhad opposed the Axis advance, and its generous Australian and British army established a critical danger to Rommel's long inventory network. He thusly dedicated his principle solidarity to blockading the city, leaving the cutting edge just meagerly held. 

Wavell characterized Operation Brevity's principle goals as the procurement of region from which to dispatch a further arranged hostile toward Tobruk, and the exhaustion of German and Italian powers in the area. With constrained fight prepared units to attract on the wake of Rommel's ongoing triumphs, on 15 May Brigadier William Gott assaulted in three sections with a blended infantry and protected power. The deliberately critical Halfaya Pass was taken against firm Italian resistance, and more profound inside Libya Fort Capuzzo was caught, however German counter-assaults under Colonel Maximilian von Herff recaptured the post amid the evening causing overwhelming setbacks among its safeguards. Gottâworried that his powers were in risk of being gotten by German protective layer in open groundâdirected an organized withdrawal to the Halfaya Pass on 16 May, and Brevity was shut down. The significance of the Halfaya Pass as a sheltered supply course was featured to Rommel, and after 11 days it was recovered amid Operation Skorpion, a German counter-assault. 

Toward the beginning of September 1940, the Italian tenth Army situated in Libya led the Italian intrusion of Egypt and after three months, the British and Commonwealth troops of the Western Desert Force started a counter-hostile, codenamed Operation Compass. In two months, the British progressed , possessing the Italian territory of Cyrenaica and annihilating the tenth Army. The development was ended in February 1941 as a result of supply deficiencies and to offer need to the Battle of Greece. Renamed XIII Corps and rearranged under HQ Cyrenaica Command (CYRCOM), the troops of the previous Western Desert Force received a protective stance. Throughout the following couple of months, HQ Cyrenaica lost its authority, Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, trailed by the second New Zealand Division and the sixth Australian Division when they were sent to Greece in Operation Luster. The seventh Armored Division, with practically no workable tanks left, was additionally pulled back and sent to the Nile Delta for rest and refitting. Wilson was supplanted by Lieutenant-General Philip Neame; portions of the second Armored Division and ninth Australian Division were sent to Cyrenaica yet the two arrangements were unpracticed, poorly prepared and on account of the second Armored Division, well under quality, after separations to Greece. 

The Italians reacted by despatching the 132nd Armored Division "Ariete" and 102nd Motorized Division"Trento" to North Africa. From February 1941 until early May, Operation Sonnenblume saw the landing of the German "Afrika Korps" in Tripoli to strengthen their Italian partners. Told by "Generalleutnant" Erwin Rommel and comprising of the fifth Light and fifteenth Panzer Division, the "Afrika Korps" was to square Allied endeavors to drive the Italians out of the area. Rommel seized on the shortcoming of his rivals and without sitting tight for his powers completely to amass, quickly went in all out attack mode. Amid March and April, the rest of the units of the second Armored Division were devastated as the Axis powers propelled, which likewise constrained the British and Commonwealth powers into retreat. Neame and the General Officer Commanding British Troops EgyptâLieutenant-General Richard O'Connorâwere caught and the British direction structure must be redesigned. HQ Cyrenaica was broken up on 14 April and its direction capacities taken over by another HQ Western Desert Force (Lieutenant-General Noel Beresford-Peirse). The ninth Australian Infantry Division fell back to the post port of Tobruk and the staying British powers pulled back a further east to Sollum on the Libyanâ Egyptian outskirt. With the fundamental Axis compel directing the Siege of Tobruk a little battlegroup ("Kampfgruppe") instructed by Colonel Maximilian von Herff kept on squeezing eastbound. Catching Fort Capuzzo and Bardia in passing, it at that point progressed into Egypt; before the finish of April had taken Sollum and the strategically critical Halfaya Pass. Rommel garrisoned these positions, fortified the "Kampfgruppe" and requested it onto the cautious. 

The Tobruk battalion got supplies from the Royal Navy and Rommel was unfit to take the port. This disappointment was huge; his bleeding edge positions at Sollum were toward the finish of an all-encompassing inventory network that extended back to Tripoli and was compromised by the Tobruk army. The considerable responsibility required to contribute Tobruk kept him from structure up his powers at Sollum, making further advances into Egypt illogical. By keeping up ownership of Tobruk, the Allies had recovered the activity. 

General Archibald Wavellâthe president of the British Middle East Commandâconsidered Operation Brevity as a quick blow in the Sollum region. Wavell proposed to make worthwhile conditions from which to dispatch Operation Battleax, the primary hostile that he was anticipating June. Task Brevity's essential destinations were to recover the Halfaya Pass, to drive the adversary from the Sollum and Capuzzo territories, and to exhaust Rommel's powers. An optional goal was to progress toward Tobruk, albeit just to the extent supplies would permit, and without taking a chance with the power focused on the task. 

Task Brevity would be done by the 22nd Guards Brigade and components of the seventh Armored Division. Its reinforced segment comprised of 29 cruiser tanks of the second Royal Tank Regiment (2RTR) and 24 infantry tanks of the fourth Royal Tank Regiment (4RTR). The Royal Air Force (RAF) distributed every single accessible contender and a little power of planes to the activity. 

Brigadier William Gottâin order of all Allied bleeding edge powers since the retreatâwas to lead the task in the field, and his arrangement was to progress in three parallel sections. On the desert flank toward the south, the seventh Armored Brigade aggregate was to move from Bir el Khireigat to Sidi Azeiz pulverizing any restriction experienced on the way. This gathering included three little portable powers ("Jock segments") of the seventh Support Group, the cruiser tanks of 2RTR, and the protected autos of the eleventh Hussars, whose task was to watch the open desert on the left flank and screen the Sidi Azeizâ Bardia street. In the inside, the 22nd Guards Brigade aggregate was to clear the highest point of the Halfaya Pass, secure Bir Wair, Musaid, and Fort Capuzzo, and lead an organization measured test toward Bardia. The gathering included two infantry arrangements (first Battalion Durham Light Infantry and second Battalion Scots Guards), and the infantry tanks of 4RTR. In the north, the "coast gathering" was to progress along the coast street, catching the lower Halfaya Pass, Sollum military quarters, and the town of Sollum. The gathering included components of the second Battalion The Rifle Brigade, and the eighth Field Regiment Royal Artillery. 

The fundamental Axis restriction was "Kampfgruppe" von Herff, situated on the desert level. It included 30â 50 tanks of the second Battalion Panzer Regiment 5, an Italian mechanized infantry unit of the "Trento" Division, and supporting arms. The cutting edge region around Halfaya Pass was shielded by two organizations of "Bersaglieri"â very much prepared Italian mechanized infantryâwith cannons support. 

On 9 May, the Germans caught a British meteorological forecast over the radio. The "Afrika Korps" war journal noticed that "before, such reports had dependably been issued preceding the essential adversary offensives to catch Sidi Barrani, Bardi, Tobruk, and the Gebel." Rommel's reaction was to reinforce the eastern side of his cordon around Tobruk as a safeguard against forays from the army, and to arrange "Kampfgruppe" von Herff to receive a progressively forceful stance. On 13 May, Axis air ship shelled British tank focuses, and Herff anticipated an up and coming British assault. Nonetheless, the next day flying machine were unfit to find the British, and it was accounted for that the "adversary goals to assault were not known". 

On 13 May, Wavell's infantry units started to accumulate at their begin lines, trailed by the tank regiments amid the early long stretches of 15 May. At 06:00, the three segments started their development, bolstered overhead by a standing watch of Hawker Hurricane warriors. 

Achieving the highest point of the Halfaya Pass, the 22nd Guards Brigade gather kept running into overwhelming resistance from an Italian "Bersaglieri" infantry organization, upheld by hostile to tank weapons, under the direction of Colonel Ugo Montemurro. This unit battled perseveringly, doing a lot to fix the poor impression Rommel had of his Italian partners. Starting to shoot upon the assaulting British tanks, the "Bersaglieri" found their 47mm enemy of tank weapons to be unfit to enter the shield of the Matilda infantry tanks. At , the heavy armament specialists moved targets. Presently going for the tracks and undercarriages, when the tanks raised up intersection low stone dividers and rocks, seven tanks were debilitated. For his lead amid this activity, Rommel prescribed that Montemurro be granted the Iron Cross First Class. At the expense of these seven tanks, the position was taken by CÂ Squadron 4RTR and GÂ Company second Scots Guards, and the unit gather pushed on towards the Bir Wair-Musaid street. At around 08:00, it got the surrender of an expansive German-Italian camp, and by 10:15 Bir Wair and Musaid had been taken despite restricted resistance. 

AÂ Squadron 4RTR and the first Durham Light Infantry (1DLI) proceeded with the development toward Fort Capuzzo. Disguised in frame down positions behind an edge close to the stronghold were 20â 30 German tanks, bolstered by hostile to tank weapons. These drew in AÂ Squadron, impairing five tanks, however were compelled to pull back as the squadron squeezed its assault. On the last way to deal with Fort Capuzzo, contact was lost between 4RTR's tanks and 1DLI's driving CÂ Company, and the assault on the fortress started without defensively covered help. The fortification was enthusiastically shielded, and it was not until just before noontime that CÂ Company, rejoined with AÂ Squadron 4RTR and strengthened by An and BÂ Companies 1DLI, in the end took the position. DÂ Company 1DLIâwhich had been available for later amid the assaultâat that point made a wide left snare to catch a little arrival ground toward the north of the post. 

Toward the evening, one organization of the second Scots Guards tested toward Bardia, the infantry going under overwhelming assault rifle shoot from three positions as they neared Sollum military enclosure. A gathering of Universal Carriersâinstructed by Sergeant F. Rileyâcharged the weapon positions and immediately killed them, yet one transporter was incapacitated when the gathering was along these lines connected by against tank firearms. Riley executed a second charge, quieting these as well and taking their groups prisoner. His bearer was hit multiple times; for his activities Riley was granted the Military Medal, the legion's first adornment of the war. 

On the desert flank, 2RTR progressed with the seventh Armored Brigade gathering. Amid the morning, reports were gotten of up to 30 German heavily clad vehicles working close-by, and AÂ Squadron 2RTR moved to examine. A large portion of the German power had pulled back, however three tanks were found and brought enduring an onslaught. One Panzer IV was impaired and the other two driven off, for the loss of one British tank because of mechanical disappointment. A second power of 15 German tanks was locked in by two tanks of NoÂ 2 Troop, decimating a Panzer III and driving the rest of pull back. By early afternoon, the detachment bunch had achieved a position west of Fort Capuzzo, and toward the evening the nine residual cruisers of AÂ Squadron 2RTR started a surveillance watch towards Sidi Azeiz. 

The development along the beach front streetâwhich needed tank supportâwas held up throughout the morning by decided Italian opposition at the base of Halfaya Pass. This goal was at long last accomplished toward night when SÂ Company second Rifle Brigadeâupheld by Australian enemy of tank heavy armament specialists battling as infantryâoverran the Italian positions taking around 130 detainees. 

In spite of the fact that the German and Italian directions in North Africa realized that a British hostile was inescapable, Operation Brevity in any case got them ill-equipped, and Rommel recorded in his journal that the underlying assaults had caused him impressive misfortunes. By early afternoon on 15 May, Axis order was appearing of perplexity. It was wrongly trusted that the hostile included in excess of 100 tanks, and rehashed demands were made to both the "Luftwaffe" and the "Regia Aeronautica" for a deliberate exertion to crush it. Powers around Tobruk were redeployed east of the assaulted city, to hinder any endeavor at alleviation and to keep the army from breaking out to meet the British development. Lieutenant-Colonel Hans Cramer was sent to strengthen "Kampfgruppe" von Herff with a tank legion from Panzer RegimentÂ 8 and a battery of hostile to flying machine firearms, and extra fortifications under General Hans-Karl Freiherr von Esebeck were despatched the next day. 

The Germans thought their riposte against the focal segment. Herffâwho had been set up to fall backârather propelled a nearby counter-assault toward Fort Capuzzo amid the evening of 15 May with the second Battalion Panzer RegimentÂ 5. At around 13:30, DÂ Company 1DLI at the arrival ground was overwhelm, and with no enemy of tank bolster more able than the Boys hostile to tank rifle, the rest of the troops of 1DLI were compelled to fall back toward Musaid. A chance residue cloud helped their withdrawal, yet by 14:45 Panzer RegimentÂ 5 was detailing that it had recovered Capuzzo, exacting overwhelming setbacks on the British and taking 70 detainees. 

On the desert flank, AÂ Squadron 2RTR's watch toward Sidi Azeiz was being checked by Panzer RegimentÂ 5, yet the Germans misidentified the light cruiser tanks as vigorously heavily clad Matilda infantry tanks, and announced that an assault was impractical. Herffâtrusting the British had two divisions working in the zoneâhad become uneasy. AÂ Squadron's watch was translated as an endeavor to think south of Sidi Azeiz, in anticipation of a push north the following day; such a move took steps to clear aside Herff's power and totally unhinge the German front in the Sollumâ Bardia territory. Accordingly, Herff broke contact with the British; his arrangement was to collaborate with Cramer's Panzer RegimentÂ 8 to mount a concentrated counter-assault the next morning. 

Understanding that the 22nd Guards Brigade gathering would be defenseless against German heavily clad counterattacks in the open ground around Bir Wair and Mussaid, Brigadier Gott pulled back it amid the early hours of the morning of 16 May. By 10:00, the infantry had taken up new positions back at Halfaya Pass, in spite of the fact that the seventh Armored Brigade aggregate was requested to stay west of Fort Capuzzo for now. 

Cramer's fortifications touched base in the Sidi Azeiz territory at 03:00 and achieved Fort Capuzzo at 06:30. At around 08:00, he reached "Kampfgruppe" von Herff, however by early in the day the two gatherings had come up short on fuel. The German development continued at 16:00 before being ceased by around 17 tanks of 2RTR. The British detailed one German tank set land and another incapacitated and that a development of up to fifty tanks had been ended, while the Germans trusted that they had repelled a solid British tank assault. As dusk drew nearer, Herff severed the activity and went on to the protective. He proposed to fix his harmed machines, revamp, and continue hostile activities on 18 May. 2RTR dismantled back to Bir el Khireigat, at first pursued by two German tanks, one of which pulled back after the other was crushed. The regiment touched base at Bir el Khireigat, from where it had set out two days already, at around 02:30 on 17 May. 

Task Brevity neglected to accomplish a large portion of its destinations, succeeding just in retaking the Halfaya Pass. The British lost five tanks annihilated and a further 13 were harmed however the tank regiments endured no misfortunes in work force. Absolute setbacks added up to no less than 206 men. The first Durham Light Infantry endured the most amid the task losing 196 men murdered, injured or caught. The second Scots Guards lost one man killed and four injured, the third Coldstream Guards lost one man killed and the eleventh Hussars endured four men injured. Misfortunes among the second Rifle Brigade are obscure. German setbacks numbered three tanks (a Panzer II and two Panzer IIIs, albeit a few more endured minor harm) and 258 men murdered, injured or caught. Jack Greene and Alessandro Massignani place absolute Italian misfortunes at 395. United records record the catch of 347 of these men. 

On 5 August, Herff commended the "Bersaglieri", who had protected Halfaya Pass "...with lionlike strength until the last man against more grounded adversary powers. The best piece of them kicked the bucket unwavering to the banner." Lieutenant Giacinto Cova, a company leader in the eighth "Bersaglieri" Regiment, got an after death Gold Medal of Military Valor, Italy's most astounding honor for courage. The decoration reference announced that Cova had sorted out a counter-assault and was executed endeavoring to toss a hand-held bomb at a British tank. The British got praises from Winston Churchill, who sent a wire to Wavell deceiving his numbness of occasions by expressing: "Without utilizing the Tiger whelps you have attacked, progressed , caught Halfaya and Sollum, taken 500 German detainees and delivered overwhelming misfortunes in men and tanks. For this twenty I tanks and 1,000 or 1,500 setbacks don't appear to be too substantial a cost." Churchill finished the message by asking Wavell "What are your dates for bringing Tiger whelps without hesitation?", in reference to the fortifications that had touched base at Alexandria on 12 May as a component of an escort code-named Operation Tiger. The eleventh Hussar's regimental history takes note of that "plainly no further hostile activity would be conceivable before 7[th] Arm[oured Division] was completely arranged". The Tiger escort brought 238 tanks and made it conceivable to refit the seventh Armored Division, which had been out of activity since February because of the misfortunes it supported amid Operation Compass. Arrangements could now be made for Operation Battleax and the alleviation of Tobruk. In the arrangement of British and Commonwealth fight praises, units that served in the Halfaya Pass zone somewhere in the range of 15 and 27 May were granted the respect "Halfaya 1941" in 1957. 

History specialist Thomas Jentz recommends that Brevity could have finished in triumph for the British. While their tank powers were battling inadequately, the "gutsy" activities by 2RTR and their watch toward Sidi Azeiz had persuaded the Germans that the fight was lost by the night of 15 May. Due to their inability to draw in 2RTR late that day, a few German administrators from Panzer Regiment 5, including its boss, were expelled from their posts after the fight. Jentz takes note of that a bluff by the first and seventh RTR out of Tobruk may have caused a realignment of the Axis powers, debilitating their general position and maybe notwithstanding compelling them to surrender the Sollum region. 

Task Brevity featured to Rommel the significance of the Halfaya Pass; whichever side held it would have a "nearly sheltered course for his provisions" amid offensives in the territory. On 27 May, he propelled Operation Skorpion, amid which Herff recovered the pass and turned around the last British regional increase from Brevity.
