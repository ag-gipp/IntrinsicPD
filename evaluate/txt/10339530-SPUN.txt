The engineer embraced the IOC's main goal to advance a brandishing soul and needed to show youngsters the Olympics with its recently procured permit. The organization chose to base the games diversion around its characters that "youngsters love and are notable" rather than making an increasingly reasonable reproduction. Sega then mentioned Nintendo for authorization to incorporate Mario in the diversion, setting up the principal matchup between their mascots.

A typical objection was that Sega and Nintendo neglected to set the primary matchup between their mascots in the class that made them renownedâstage recreations. Rather, the two organizations tossed Mario and Sonic into an Olympic-themed party computer game, a move which Tae Kim of "GamePro" reprimanded as "a promoting device" to advance the XXIX Olympic Games. In spite of the fact that the Wii variant of the diversion was applauded for being an engaging multiplayer experience, it was condemned for shallow ongoing interaction and complex standards and guidelines. GameTrailers presumed that "Mario and Sonic's" absence of "clean and straightforwardness" leaves the unlikely gathering of mascots as its primary fascination when contrasted with other gathering computer games discharged for the stage. 

GameSpot's Aaron Thomas evaluated the Wii variant's movement control conspire as "uninteresting and sometimes baffling". X-Play's Morgan Webb concurred, calling the controls "non-instinctive" and remarking that the minigames expected players to "wave their Wiimotes quickly while squeezing a few catches in the meantime".

The two analysts supported the more mind boggling destinations found in the dream occasions of the amusement, which imparted ascribes to that of the Mario sport diversions and arrow based weaponry. 

On the Nintendo DS, "Mario and Sonic" was viewed as basically a similar amusement in plan as its Wii partner; notwithstanding, conclusions on its control plot fluctuated incredibly. GameSpy's Gerald Villoria thought the tradeoffs between the two forms made them similarly charming. Andrew Fitch of 1UP.com guaranteed perusers in his audit that the less physically requesting ongoing interaction of the DS variant made the diversion open for broadened timeframes. Fitch further expressed that in almost "every case, occasions [were] unquestionably increasingly charming on the DS" because of the prerequisite of the human body's better engine aptitude capacities to control the characters.

Craig Harris of IGN had a comparable feeling, expressing, "Quickly drumming the controllers is unquestionably more testing than rapidly stroking the touchscreen." Harris felt the DS form lost some pertinence to its insignificantly prevalent Wii partner since had a comparative plan and discharged just about three months a while later. 

Most productions concurred that the Wii partner of "Mario and Sonic" had clean surfaces and well-done livelinesss; N-Europe's Iun Hockley believed that each character was pleasingly rendered, and Thomas included that the illustrations were "fresh and brilliant". Imprint Bozon favored the remixed Nintendo and Sega music and thought the general Olympic-related music "[could] be somewhat conventional". GameDaily's Robert Workman called the ambient melodies "for the most part forgettable".

Contrasted with the Wii variant, the DS adaptation's visuals are of a similar style and its designs are about on a similar dimension. Because of the failure to contend with different players on the web, Harris respected "Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games" constrained utilization of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection on the DS as a "botched chance". Numerous commentators, including Gibson and Pro-G's James Orry, found the transferring of best occasions and scores to be a bulky procedure. Despite the fact that the home comfort form additionally has online rankings, it needs direct challenge between players. Disillusioned with the previously mentioned angle, Bozon excused that the leaderboards "unquestionably [made] sense for an amusement like this".
