It was the primary collection since his arrival to the band in 2008 to exclude songwriting or execution commitments from bassist Twiggy, who was occupied with his very own undertakings.

Marilyn Manson was a standout amongst the most disputable metal groups of the late 1990s. In 1999, news media dishonestly scapegoated the band for impacting the culprits of the Columbine High School slaughter, which the vocalist has guaranteed "completely pushed [my career] in the soil". Consequent collections were condemned by the two faultfinders and fans alike, and the band was dropped by its long-term record mark Interscope in 2009. After a year, they marked a joint-adventure manage London-based autonomous record name Cooking Vinyl. "Conceived Villain" was discharged in 2012, and was proclaimed as an arrival to frame. 

In August 2012, it was declared that Manson would play a fictionalized rendition of himself in a four-scene curve of the 6th period of TV arrangement "Californication". While taping its season finale, Manson met the arrangement's score author, Tyler Bates, and the two talked about a potential joint effort. In May 2013, Manson affirmed that creation had begun on new material. They held their first composition session in a little practice space, joined by previous Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo. This session demonstrated fruitless, and the pair neglected to compose any considerable material. Bates later proposed that they hold further composition sessions at his home studio, which brought about their organization of "Feathered creatures of Hell Awaiting" in "one unconstrained trade". 

This was immediately trailed by "Third Day of a Seven Day Binge". Manson said that the account of the collection "just turned into a cadence. This was something I was eager to do." This is as an unmistakable difference to the chronicle of "The High End of Low" (2009) and "Conceived Villain", when he was habitually "hauled into the studio" late during the evening to record vocals. He attributed this eagerness to the community oriented procedure among him and Bates, saying that he understood after the primary execution of "Winged animals of Hell Awaiting" that "[I] just sang it. I didn't know where the music would go and I just ran with it and it was natural. And afterward it opened up an entire diverse piece of my psyche." 

Bates called the chronicle procedure "consistent" in view of the eccentric studio condition. Manson, separated in a vocal corner without any than three individuals in the control room at any one time, was allowed to ad lib or grow new verses and vocal songs at a fast. By utilizing Pro Tools, Bates had the capacity to "control the music in a way that would permit [Manson] to simply continue dealing with it without causing [a delay]. On the off chance that he had a thought, he could simply toss it down without there being a ton to clarify." most of the collection was recorded amid a three-month time frame. The band's chief, Tony Ciulla, just ended up mindful that Manson had been recording new material when he was welcome to Bates' home account studio, where Bates played finished editions of nine of the collection's ten tracks; "Cupid Carries a Gun" was the main track not yet finished. With the base tracks recorded, overdubbing occurred over the accompanying a half year between Manson's acting responsibilities on "Children of Anarchy" and Bates scoring the 2014 TV arrangement "Salem". 

Gil Sharone, of The Dillinger Escape Plan and Stolen Babies, performed live drums on the collection. Sharone was first reached by Bates about the venture in January 2014, three days before he was because of start a visit with Stolen Babies. He created and recorded his drum work more than two days at Igloo Studios in Burbank, California. Long-term bassist â and Manson's central teammate â Twiggy did not participate in the composition and recording process, as he was occupied with account his very own material. It was the principal discharge since his arrival to the band in 2008 to not highlight Twiggy's contribution. His colleague on the Goon Moon venture, Fred Sablan, withdrew Marilyn Manson on great terms. Manson's "Children of Anarchy" co-star Walton Goggins shows up as a minister on collection track "Slave Only Dreams to Be King", discussing two stanzas from James Allens mid twentieth century exposition "As a Man Thinketh". Manson declared that the band's new collection was "readied for arriving" toward the beginning of September. He committed the record to his mom, Barbara Warner, who passed on May 13, 2014, eight years subsequent to being determined to have Alzheimer's illness. 

In a January 2014 meeting with "Kerrang!" magazine, Manson portrayed the sound of the collection as being "extremely true to life", saying that the "redneck in me turns out in my voice" attributable to the collection's incorporation of blues impacts, while as yet holding the harder components of past work. The collection has been contrasted with the music which was utilized to soundtrack "Children of Anarchy". Manson called himself "a man of few words" [on the record], selecting to enable song to be its essential center, rather than utilizing characters or stretched out similitudes to form verses. Verses for the collection were altogether gotten from a solitary note pad, with Manson conceding that the substance of past work was excessively dissipated, as they were made out of material taken from up to 20 unique note pads. He has portrayed it as being deliberately meager melodiously, expounding that blues music comes from the "throaty, instinctive component of music. I [left] openings in these accounts so it turns into your story, it turns out to be increasingly true to life. For instance in the film "Rosemary's Baby", you don't see the child however in your mind you do." 

"The Pale Emperor" is a takeoff from the band's typical style, inclining far from the modern creation that showed up on a lot of their past work and consolidating a sparser sound, which has been depicted as elective nation, blues shake, gothic metal and hard shake.

Lady", recommending that in the two collections the two groups were re-empowered in the last piece of their profession. He additionally contrasted Manson's vocal style with that of Jim Morrison, and asserted the collection's verses reverberation Morrison's "pointless self-magnification". 

The collection's title is a reference to Constantius I â or Constantius the Pale â who was the main Roman sovereign to preclude the presence from securing a God. Manson has said its significance can have a few elucidations: "appearance or Goth music or 'past the pale' or [...] everything 'fails to measure up' to it". Melodiously, the collection manages mortality, war, savagery, subjection and religion, and incorporates references to Greek folklore and German fables, explicitly the narrative of Faust and Mephistopheles. "The Mephistopheles of Los Angeles" was the first title track and, as indicated by Manson, the collection's heart. "The Pale Emperor" utilizes an all-encompassing analogy, in which Manson looks at his very own profession to the life of Faust. He told "The Philadelphia Inquirer" that he "sold [his] soul to turn into a hero, and this installment in fullâwith enthusiasm, considering the last couple of bills I didn't pay," clarifying that he considered "The High End of Low" and "Conceived Villain" ailing in core interest. He expounded to "Great Rock" magazine: 

All through the collection, Manson sings in an unexpected key in comparison to on any of the band's past discharges. He has asserted that his voice can produce five distinct tones at the same time, and that blending engineer Robert Carranza demonstrated to him that an account of his vocals shaped a visual pentagram when brought into a phrasal analyzer. Bates has said that the vocals on the collection are stripped down in contrast with past records, which he viewed as overproduced.
