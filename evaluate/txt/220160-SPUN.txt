Thierry Daniel Henry (; brought into the world 17 August 1977) is a French proficient football mentor and previous player who was most as of late the director of Ligue 1 club Monaco. 

Thought about a standout amongst the best strikers ever, Henry made his expert presentation with Monaco in 1994, where great structure prompted a worldwide call-up in 1998, after which he marked for shielding Serie A victors Juventus. Constrained playing time at Juve where he was happened of position on the wing enabled him to sign for Premier League club Arsenal for Â£11Â million every year later. 

It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class player. Under long-term guide and mentor ArsÃ¨ne Wenger, Henry turned into a productive striker and Arsenal's unequaled driving scorer with 228 objectives in all rivalries. He won two FA Cups and two group titles at the club, including one unbeaten. In 2003 and 2004, Henry was the sprinter up for the FIFA World Player of the Year.

Henry spent his last two seasons with Arsenal as club skipper, driving them to the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. 

In June 2007, following eight years with Arsenal, he exchanged to Barcelona for a charge of â¬24Â million. In 2009, he was a vital piece of the club's noteworthy treble when they won La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League. He proceeded to accomplish a remarkable sextuple by likewise winning the Supercopa de EspaÃ±a, the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. In 2010, he joined New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer (MLS), where he won the MLS Supporters' Shield in 2013. He additionally came back to Arsenal on advance for two months in 2012, preceding resigning in 2014. 

Henry appreciated supported accomplishment with France, winning the 1998 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2000 and 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. In October 2007, he turned into his nation's record goalscorer. Subsequent to accumulating 123 appearances and 51 objectives, Henry resigned from worldwide football after the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Henry was likewise one of the top monetarily showcased footballers; he was positioned ninth on the planet in 2006. 

Subsequent to resigning, Henry progressed into training, and was delegated as an associate mentor at Belgium in 2016, preceding accepting the job as the head mentor at Monaco in 2018. He was diminished of his obligations at Monaco in January 2019. 

Henry is of Antillean legacy: his dad, Antoine, is from Guadeloupe (La DÃ©sirade island), and his mom, Maryse, is from Martinique. He was brought up in Les Ulis suburb of Paris which, regardless of once in a while being viewed as an intense neighborhood, gave great footballing offices. As a seven-year-old, Henry indicated extraordinary potential, inciting Claude Chezelle to select him to the neighborhood club CO Les Ulis. His dad constrained him to go to preparing, despite the fact that the youth was not especially attracted to football. He went along with US Palaiseau in 1989, yet following a year his dad dropped out with the club, so Henry moved to ES Viry-ChÃ¢tillon and played there for a long time. US Palaiseau mentor Jean-Marie Panza, Henry's future coach, tailed him there. 

In 1990, Monaco sent scout Arnold Catalano to watch Henry, at that point at 13 years old in a match. Henry scored each of the six objectives as his side won 6â 0. Catalano requested that he join Monaco without going to a preliminary first. Catalano mentioned that Henry complete a course at the tip top INF Clairefontaine institute, and in spite of the executive's hesitance to concede Henry because of his poor school results, he was permitted to finish the course and joined ArsÃ¨ne Wenger's Monaco as a young player. Accordingly, Henry marked proficient structures with Monaco, and made his expert presentation on 31 August 1994, in a 2â 0 misfortune against Nice. In spite of the fact that Wenger suspected that Henry ought to be conveyed as a striker, he put Henry on the left wing since he trusted that his pace, regular ball control and aptitude would be more compelling against full backs than focus backs. 

After a speculative begin to his Monaco vocation, Henry was named the French Young Footballer of the Year in 1996, and in the 1996â 97 season, his strong exhibitions helped the club win the Ligue 1 title. Amid the 1997â 98 season, he was instrumental in driving his club to the UEFA Champions League semi-last, setting a French record by scoring seven objectives in the challenge. By his third season, he had gotten his first top for the national group, and was a piece of the triumphant group in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He kept on inspiring at his residency with Monaco, and in his five seasons with the French club, the youthful winger scored 20 association objectives in 105 appearances. 

Henry left Monaco in January 1999, one year before his personal and nearest colleague David Trezeguet, and moved to Italian club Juventus for Â£10.5Â million. He played on the wing, yet he was insufficient against the cautious order shown by groups in Serie A, battling in a position that was strange for him, scoring only three objectives in 16 appearances. 

Agitated in Italy, Henry exchanged from Juventus on 3 August 1999 to Arsenal for an expected charge of Â£11Â million, rejoining with his previous administrator ArsÃ¨ne Wenger. It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer, and in spite of the fact that his exchange was not without debate, Wenger was persuaded he merited the exchange expense. Gotten as a substitution for individual French forward Nicolas Anelka, Henry was promptly shaped into a striker by Wenger, a move that would pay rich profits in years to come. Be that as it may, questions were raised about his capacity to adjust to the speedy and physical English diversion when he neglected to score in his initial eight amusements. Following a few troublesome months in England, Henry even yielded that he needed to "be re-instructed everything about the specialty of striking." These questions were dispersed when he finished his first season at Arsenal with an amazing objective count of 26. His objective count incorporated a stupendous strike against Manchester United where he flicked the ball up (with his back swung to objective), before he swiveled and volleyed in from 30 yards out. The strike likewise highlighted a paramount objective festival where he reproduced the Budweiser "Whassup?" ad. Arms stockpile completed second in the Premier League behind Manchester United, and lost in the UEFA Cup Final against Turkish club Galatasaray. 

Returning off the of a triumphant UEFA Euro 2000 crusade with the national group, Henry was prepared to have an effect in the 2000â 01 season. In spite of account less objectives and helps than his first season, Henry's second season with Arsenal turned out to be a leap forward, as he turned into the club's top goalscorer. Furnished with one of the alliance's best assaults, Arsenal wrapped sprinter up to perpetual adversaries Manchester United in the Premier League. The group additionally achieved the last of the FA Cup, losing 2â 1 to Liverpool. Henry stayed baffled, in any case, by the way that he still couldn't seem to enable the club to win praises, and as often as possible communicated his longing to set up Arsenal as a powerhouse. 

Achievement at long last touched base amid the 2001â 02 season. Weapons store completed seven above Liverpool to win the Premier League title, and crushed Chelsea 2â 0 in the FA Cup Final. Henry turned into the group's top goalscorer and got 32 objectives in all rivalries as he drove Arsenal to a twofold and his first flatware with the club. There was much desire that Henry would repeat his club structure for France amid the 2002 FIFA World Cup, yet the protecting bosses endured a stun exit at the gathering stage. 

2002â 03 ended up being another profitable season for Henry, as he scored 32 objectives in all rivalries while contributing 23 helpsânoteworthy returns for a striker. In doing as such, he drove Arsenal to another FA Cup triumph (where he was man-of-the-coordinate in the Final), despite the fact that Arsenal neglected to hold their Premier League title. All through the season, he contended with Manchester United's Ruud van Nistelrooy for the alliance scoring title, however the Dutchman edged Henry to the Golden Boot by a solitary objective. In any case, Henry was named both the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year. His rising status as one of the world's best footballers was insisted when he developed sprinter up for the 2003 FIFA World Player of the Year grant. 

Entering the 2003â 04 season, Arsenal were resolved to recover the Premier League crown. Henry was again instrumental in Arsenal's particularly fruitful battle; together with any semblance of Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Robert Pires, Henry guaranteed that the Gunners turned into the principal group in over a century to experience the whole residential class season unbeaten, asserting the association title all the while. Aside from being named for the second year running as the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year, Henry developed indeed as the sprinter up for 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year grant. With 39 objectives scored in all rivalries, the Frenchman drove the class in objectives scored and won the European Golden Boot. Be that as it may, just like the case in 2002, Henry was unfit to lead the national side to praises amid UEFA Euro 2004. 

This dunk in progress was intensified when Arsenal bombed again to verify consecutive class titles when they missed out to Chelsea in the 2004â 05 season, despite the fact that Arsenal won the FA Cup (the Final of which Henry missed through damage). Henry kept up his notoriety for being a standout amongst Europe's most dreaded strikers as he drove the association in scoring, and with 31 objectives in all rivalries, he was the co-beneficiary (with Diego ForlÃ¡n) of the European Golden Boot, and is right now the main player to have authoritatively won the honor twice straight (Ally McCoist additionally had two Golden Boots in succession, however both were considered informal). The sudden flight of Arsenal's chief Patrick Vieira in the 2005 close season prompted Henry being granted club captaincy, a job which many felt was not normally appropriate for him; the captaincy is all the more usually given to safeguards or midfielders, who are better-set on the pitch to peruse the diversion. Alongside being boss goalscorer, he was in charge of driving a youthful group which presently couldn't seem to gel completely. 

The 2005â 06 season ended up being one of surprising individual accomplishments for Henry. On 17 October 2005, Henry turned into the club's top goalscorer ever; two objectives against Sparta Prague in the Champions League implied he broke Ian Wright's record of 185 objectives. On 1 February 2006, he scored an objective against West Ham United, bringing his association objective count up to 151, breaking Arsenal legend Cliff Bastin's alliance objectives record. Henry scored his 100th association objective at Highbury, an accomplishment unparalleled ever of club, and an interesting accomplishment in the Premier League.

He finished the season as the alliance's top goalscorer, was casted a ballot the FWA Footballer of the Year for the third time in his vocation, and was chosen in the FIFA World XI. 

All things considered, Arsenal neglected to win the Premier League title once more, yet any expectations of a trophy were restored when Arsenal came to the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. The Gunners inevitably lost 2â 1 to Barcelona, and Arsenal's failure to win the class title for two back to back seasons joined with the general inability of the Arsenal squad caused much hypothesis that Henry would leave for another club. In any case, he pronounced his affection for the club and acknowledged a four-year contract, and said he would remain at Arsenal forever. Munititions stockpile bad habit executive David Dein later guaranteed the club had turned down two offers of Â£50Â million from Spanish clubs for Henry before the marking of the new contract. Had the exchange emerged, it would have outperformed the then-world record Â£47Â million paid for Zinedine Zidane. 

Henry's 2006â 07 season was damaged by wounds. In spite of the fact that he scored 10 objectives in 17 residential appearances for Arsenal, Henry's season was stopped in February. Having missed recreations because of hamstring, foot, and back issues, he was regarded fit enough to come on as a late substitute against PSV in a Champions League coordinate, however started limping soon after going ahead. Sweeps the following day uncovered that he would require somewhere around three months to recuperate from new crotch and stomach wounds, missing the remainder of the 2006â 07 season. Wenger ascribed Henry's wounds to an extended 2005â 06 crusade, and emphasized that Henry was enthusiastic about remaining with the Gunners to reconstruct for the 2007â 08 season. 

On 25 June 2007, in a startling unforeseen development, Henry was exchanged to Barcelona for â¬24Â million. He marked a four-year bargain for a revealed â¬6.8 (Â£4.6) million for each season. It was uncovered that the agreement incorporated a discharge proviso of â¬125 (Â£84.9) million. Henry refered to the flight of Dein and proceeded with vulnerability over Wenger's future as purposes behind leaving, and kept up that "I generally said that on the off chance that I at any point left Arsenal it is play for Barcelona." Despite their chief's takeoff, Arsenal got off to a noteworthy begin for the 2007â 08 crusade, and Henry said that his quality in the group may have been even more a deterrent than an assistance. He expressed, "On account of my status, the way that I was chief and my propensity for shouting for the ball, they would in some cases offer it to me notwithstanding when I was not in the best position. So in that sense it was useful for the group that I proceeded onward." Henry left Arsenal as the club's driving untouched association goalscorer with 174 objectives and driving unequaled goalscorer in European rivalries with 42 objectives; in July 2008, Arsenal fans casted a ballot him as Arsenal's most noteworthy player ever in Arsenal.com's Gunners' Greatest 50 Players survey. 

At Barcelona, Henry was given the number 14 pullover, equivalent to he had worn at Arsenal. He scored his first objective for his new club on 19 September 2007 out of a 3â 0 Champions League aggregate stage prevail upon Lyon, and he recorded his first cap trap for BarÃ§a in a Primera DivisiÃ³n coordinate against Levante ten days after the fact. In any case, with Henry for the most part sent on the wing all through the season, he was unfit to recreate the objective scoring structure he accomplished with Arsenal. He communicated disappointment with the move to Barcelona in the underlying year, in the midst of broad hypothesis of an arrival to the Premier League. In a meeting with Garth Crooks on BBC's "Football Focus", Henry portrayed missing life "back home" and even "the English press." However, Henry finished up his introduction season as the club's top scorer with 19 objectives notwithstanding nine class helps, second behind Lionel Messi's ten. 

Henry proceeded to outperform this count in a progressively incorporated 2008â 09 crusade, with 26 objectives and 10 helps from the left wing. He won the principal trophy of his Barcelona vocation on 13 May 2009 when Barcelona vanquished Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey last. Barcelona won the Primera DivisiÃ³n and UEFA Champions League before long, finishing a treble for the Frenchman, who had joined with Messi and Samuel Eto'o to score 100 objectives between them that season. The trio was additionally the most productive trio in Spanish class history, scoring 72 objectives and outperforming the 66 objectives of Real Madrid's Ferenc PuskÃ¡s, Alfredo Di StÃ©fano and Luis del Sol of the 1960â 61 season (this was later outperformed by Real Madrid trio Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gonzalo HiguaÃ­n who scored 89 objectives in 2011â 12). Later in 2009, Henry helped Barcelona win an uncommon sextuple, comprising of the previously mentioned treble, the Supercopa de EspaÃ±a, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup. 

The accompanying season, the development of Pedro implied that Henry just begun 15 association recreations. Before the La Liga season finished, and with a year still left on his agreement, club president Joan Laporta expressed on 5 May 2010 that Henry "may leave in the late spring exchange window if that is the thing that he needs." After Henry came back from the 2010 World Cup, Barcelona affirmed that they had consented to the clearance of Henry to an anonymous club, with the player still to concur terms with the new club. 

In July 2010, Henry marked a multi-year contract with Major League Soccer (MLS) club New York Red Bulls for the 2010 season as its second assigned player.

The following season, the Red Bulls were tenth by and large in the association, and bowed out in the Conference semi-finals of the 2011 MLS Cup Playoffs. 

In the wake of preparing with Arsenal amid the MLS off-season, Henry re-marked for the club on a two-month advance arrangement on 6 January 2012. This was to give spread to Gervinho and Marouane Chamakh, who were inaccessible because of their cooperation in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. Henry was given the number 12 pullover â his old Arsenal number 14 shirt, a similar number he wore at Barcelona and New York, was inaccessible, with Theo Walcott acquiring it following Henry's takeoff from the club in 2007.

Amid the 2006 FIFA World Cup Henry stayed as one of the programmed starters in the squad. He played as a solitary striker, yet regardless of an unconcerned begin to the competition, ended up one of the top players of the World Cup. He scored three objectives, including the triumphant objective from Zidane's free kick against protecting victors Brazil in the quarter-last. Be that as it may, France in this manner lost to Italy on punishments (5â 3) in the last.

The French group battled amid the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and completed second in their gathering behind Serbia. Amid the play-offs against the Republic of Ireland, Henry was engaged with a contention in the second leg of the diversion at the Stade de France on 18 November 2009. With the total score tied at 1â 1 and the amusement in additional time, he utilized his hand twice to control the ball before conveying a cross to William Gallas who scored the victor.

The Football Association of Ireland held up a formal grievance with FIFA, looking for a replay of the amusement, which FIFA declined. Henry said that he thought about resigning from worldwide football after the responses to the occurrence, yet kept up that he was not a "cheat"; hours after FIFA had discounted a replay, he expressed that "the most attractive arrangement is replay the diversion". FIFA President Sepp Blatter depicted the episode as "obtrusive uncalled for play" and declared an investigation into how such occurrences could be stayed away from in future, and included that the occurrence would be researched by the Disciplinary Committee. Blatter additionally said Henry revealed to him that his family had been undermined in the result of the occurrence. In January 2010, FIFA reported that there was no legitimate premise to endorse Henry. 

Henry did not highlight in the beginning line-up for France at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. France attracted their first amusement against Uruguay, and lost 2â 0 in their second against Mexico.

In spite of the fact that Henry played in advance as a striker amid his childhood, he invested his energy at Monaco and Juventus playing on the wing. At the point when Henry joined Arsenal in 1999, Wenger quickly changed this, changing Henry to his youth position, regularly blending him with Dutch veteran Dennis Bergkamp. Amid the 2004â 05 season, Wenger changed Arsenal's arrangement to 4â 5â 1. This change constrained Henry to adjust again to fit into the Arsenal group, and he played numerous recreations as a solitary striker. All things considered, Henry remained Arsenal's primary hostile risk, on numerous events conjuring dynamite objectives. Wenger said of his kindred Frenchman: "Thierry Henry could take the ball amidst the recreation center and score an objective that nobody else on the planet could score". 

One reason refered to for Henry's amazing play in advance is his capacity to serenely score from one-on-ones. As indicated by his dad Antoine, Henry took in exactness shooting from watching his deity Marco van Basten. He was additionally impacted by RomÃ¡rio, Ronaldo and Liberian star George Weah, another type of strikers during the 1990s who might likewise work outside the punishment territory before running with the ball towards objective. At his physical top from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, Henry's capacity to spill past adversaries with outstanding pace, aptitude and levelheadedness, implied that he could get in behind protectors normally enough to score. In 2004, previous Arsenal striker Alan Smith remarked on Henry: "I need to state I haven't seen a player like him. He's a competitor with incredible specialized capacity and an enormous want to be the best." 

At the point when in advance, Henry is once in a while known to move out wide to one side wing position, something which empowers him to contribute vigorously in helps: between 2002â 03 and 2004â 05, the striker oversaw just about 50 aids aggregate and this was ascribed to his unselfish play and innovativeness. Rolling in from the left, Henry's trademark complete saw him place the ball inside the extreme right corner of the objective. Henry would likewise float offside to trick the safeguard at that point keep running back onside before the ball is played and beat the offside device, in spite of the fact that he never given Arsenal a particular elevated risk. Given his adaptability in having the capacity to work as both a winger and a striker, the Frenchman is certainly not a prototypical "outright striker", however he has risen reliably as a standout amongst Europe's most productive strikers. In set pieces, Henry was the main decision punishment and free kick taker for Arsenal, scoring routinely from those positions. Henry was likewise a striking example of a no-look pass where he would bluff to pass the ball with his correct foot, however would reach the ball utilizing his standing foot (his left). 

Henry started instructing Arsenal's childhood groups in February 2015, pair with his work for Sky Sports. His impact in the group was commended by players, for example, Alex Iwobi, who devoted an objective against Bayern Munich in the 2015â 16 UEFA Youth League to his recommendation. Having earned a UEFA A License, he was offered the activity of under-18 mentor by Academy head Andries Jonker, however the choice was overruled by Wenger, who needed a full-time mentor for the group. 

In August 2016, Henry turned out to be second colleague mentor of the Belgium national group, working nearby head mentor Roberto MartÃ­nez and individual right hand Graeme Jones. In a meeting with NBC Sports, Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku adulated Henry for his work with him, expressing, "Henry is the best thing that has transpired on the grounds that since I came to England matured 18 I have had the best coaches. Thierry for me is the best. Consistently whether it is certain and negative I take it in my walk since I recognize what is normal from the top dimension." At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Belgium achieved the semi-last, however lost to Henry's home country France 1â 0. Henry got a Bronze decoration after Belgium crushed England 2â 0 in the third-place play-off to verify their best ever World Cup wrap up. 

Henry was purportedly offered the situation of head mentor by Bordeaux in August 2018. Be that as it may, the offer was not acknowledged by Henry after conflicts with the club's proprietors. Days subsequent to turning down the Bordeaux occupation, and following Jones' takeoff from the Belgium national group, Henry, who had been the advances mentor, was elevated to Belgium associate mentor. Be that as it may, his residency in the job was fleeting, after he acknowledged the job as head mentor at previous club Monaco in October. 

On 11 October 2018, Monaco rejected Leonardo Jardim as club supervisor. Jardim's position had turned out to be indefensible in the wake of battling intensely in residential challenge, with the club eighteenth at the season of his takeoff, and disagreements regarding the club's exchange arrangement. Monaco's scan for another mentor concurred with the administrative mid-season universal break, permitting the club adequate time to look for a substitution, notwithstanding, they immediately chose Henry, and he was designated a unimportant two days after the fact. He marked a three-year bargain, and was uncovered as Monaco chief on 18 October. At his first question and answer session, he told correspondents: "This club will dependably have a major spot in my heart, so to have the capacity to come here and begin once more, it is a blessing from heaven. There is a ton of work to do, as you can envision â however I am glad to be here". 

Henry's landing in Monaco was welcomed with blended responses by certain news sources, because of his relative naivetÃ© as a top-level mentor and the errand of toppling Monaco's hardships. Notwithstanding acquiring a squad of unacceptable quality, Henry communicated a longing of recreating the football he played under Pep Guardiola at Barcelona, just as imparting the "demonstrable skill" instructed to him by ArsÃ¨ne Wenger. Henry likewise received a hands-on way to deal with instructional meetings, being normally engaged with contriving plans and training drills.
