A great part of the remainder of the East Coast was influenced by high breezes, waterfront flooding, and shoreline disintegration. New York State and New England endured the worst part of the tempest; harm was broad on Long Island, and in Connecticut, 130,000Â households lost electric power amid the tempest. Far reaching harm and power blackouts likewise happened all through Rhode Island and Massachusetts, where the tempest produced waves along the coast. Due to the warm climate design that added to the tempest's advancement, precipitation was restricted to rain. Two individuals were murdered, and harm added up to at any rate $21Â million.

National Hurricane Center forecaster Jack Beven noticed that "as it moved out into the Bahamas, it seemed to assume the qualities of a typhoon." The dubious idea of the tempest kept the NHC from issuing warnings on it, and forecasters needed adequate information to completely evaluate the violent wind for potential tropical attributes. A similar trough that pushed the tempest crosswise over Florida had moved toward the north, taking into consideration high strain to create in the upper dimensions of the environment. 

Regarded a "half breed storm", the tornado quickly increased in warm waters of up to from the Gulf Stream joined with a virus air mass over the United States. The framework proceeded to quickly increase while moving inside the Gulf Stream; it created focal convection, a strange characteristic for an extratropical violent wind, and at one point showed an eye. Notwithstanding these signs of tropical attributes, "There was no front related with it and it had a warm center, yet the span of most extreme breezes was more than , so under the standard NHC criteria it didn't qualify as a hurricane." On December 23 and 24, the nor'easter heightened to accomplish a barometric weight of . An upper-level low weight framework that created behind the tempest started to strengthen and developed to be bigger in size than the first aggravation.
