The choice by Media Factory to forcefully seek after its licensed innovation rights for "School Rumble" is accepted by advocates of fansubs to have negatively affected the establishment's discharge and deals in the North American market. 

In 2009, Kobayashi said ""School Rumble" is a critical piece that I need to draw more, however I needed to accomplish increasingly different things so I finished it. When I have some time, I might want to draw their grown-up days in a seinen magazine." 

"School Rumble" is a sentimental "shÅnen" satire spinning around the day by day lives of the understudies of Class 2-C at the anecdotal Yagami High School, alongside their loved ones. The primary female hero is Tenma Tsukamoto, an unremarkable second-year secondary school understudy who covertly appreciates her offbeat, perplexing, decent person schoolmate, Oji Karasuma. Tenma battles to admit her sentiments to Karasuma. He stays absent to her enthusiasm, rather looking for satisfaction by enjoying curry. The primary male hero, reprobate Kenji Harima, comparably longs for Tenma, going to class exclusively to be close to her. Like Tenma, Harima experiences issues pronouncing his adoration, and at whatever point he gathers the valor to do as such, conditions plot against him. 

Harima muddles the adoration triangle through consistent blundering, and mistaken assumptions among the understudies irritate the circumstance. Harima winds up included with Tenma's dear companion, Eri Sawachika, after the pair are put together in commonly humiliating circumstances. Later in the arrangement, he builds up a kinship with Tenma's more youthful sister, Yakumo Tsukamoto, who turns into Harima's aide on a manga he composes. The plots of Harima's accounts depict a Harima-like saint battling to spare a Tenma-like maid in different verifiable or fantastical circumstances, as a rule fighting against an undeniable copy of Karasuma. After the legend spares the courageous woman, she generally experiences passionate feelings for him. Yakumo's association with Harima causes issues with Class 2-C's understudy agent, Haruki Hanai, who really likes Yakumo, with the sisters' shared surname causing Harima and Hanai to misjudge the object of every others' individual fixations. In spite of the fact that Harima figures out how to design sentimental experiences with Tenma, her association with Karasuma by and by advances, and Harima's bonds with Eri and Yakumo become more grounded. In the end Tenma assembles the bravery to admit her adoration, however not long after Karasuma loses his memory. His amnesia gives a reason to Tenma's life; she focuses on her examinations to turn into a specialist and help Karasuma. 

Despite the fact that "School Rumble" centers around Harima and Tenma, the arrangement investigates various supporting characters. These incorporate Tenma's companions Mikoto Suo, who runs a kenpo dojo where her cherished companion, Hanai, trains, and Akira Takano, a baffling and uncannily discerning young lady. As the story advances, increasingly real characters are brought into the relationship web. 

"School Rumble Z", the "parallel parody", closes with Class 2-C's graduation function. Now the vast majority of the plot-lines are settled, yet there is no reasonable goals for the primary heroes. Karasuma still experiences memory misfortune, and in spite of the fact that Harima goes to the service with Eri, their relationship status continues as before. There is a scene in the last part which could either be a creative ability from Max or a flashforward, which demonstrates Harima and Eri visiting Karasuma and the Tsukamoto sisters together, with Eri conveying a youngster in her arms. 

Jin Kobayashi started stating "School Rumble", his introduction work, in 2002. He expressed to a group of people at Honolulu's 2006 Kawaii Kon tradition that he began composing the arrangement since he considered the possibility of a manga including a reprobate beginning to look all starry eyed at intriguing. Kobayashi's most loved character, Kenji Harima, depends to a great extent on an amalgam of different companions, despite the fact that he gauges "about 30%" of Harima is an impression of himself. In any case, in spite of putting the vast majority of his own emotions into the female characters, he expressed that Ryuuhei Suga, a minor supporting character, is the most self-portraying. A large portion of different characters depend on recollections of previous secondary school colleagues; Kobayashi reviewed that he had no genuine thought of their voices when drawing them, and it was not until some other time, when he heard the voice performing artists' elucidations amid the generation of the anime arrangement, that he knew how they should sound. He recognized that a few characters are more created than others; in answer to a fan question about the puzzling Akira Takano, he conceded that, notwithstanding the closeness he feels for her, he didn't put much accentuation on Takano and intended to build up her affection life gradually. Kobayashi deliberately based his story curves on errors which he at that point settle, since he accepts "in the event that there's no misconception, at that point there's no entertaining story." He asserts that none of his accounts depend on genuine occasions, in spite of the fact that when squeezed concedes the likelihood of certain similarities yet without revealing explicit subtleties. 

Kobayashi and his editors worked together on the plotlines. Kobayashi would then draw the fundamental delineations for every section before passing his material to colleagues to wrap up. As the arrangement's manga craftsman, Kobayashi additionally planned the spread workmanship. Initially, the fifth volume's title page was to highlight Akira Takano, however after re-perusing the volume Kobayashi reasoned that since a lot of its plot in that volume rotates around Karen Ichijo, she ought to be on the spread. Wanting to include a male character, he set Harima on the front of volume six. Kobayashi structured a publication to celebrate the completion of the arrangement with the last section of "School Rumble Z". 

An anime adjustment of the arrangement was never imagined by Kobayashi, and he was suspicious of the task when initially drew closer. Arrangements and planning took some time, however he professes to be content with the final product. On review the principal anime film, Kobayashi was dumbfounded; he reviews in a meeting his feelings at the time, expressing "I was inconceivably contacted by it. Totally survive." Impressed with the adjustment of his work, he applauds the anime staff for their accomplishment, in spite of the fact that yielding that "School Rumble" likely fit the anime design. He refers to the angling scene, for which he provided the voice representing a few minor parts, as his top choice. 

Kobayashi permitted the voice performing artists who voiced his characters huge opportunity to decipher them as they picked. There were various cast changes all through the generation; Ami Koshimizu, the voice performer for Tenma, had at first tried out for the job of Yakumo, and between "School Rumble"s first and second seasons the voice on-screen characters for both Karen Ichijo and Yoko Sasakura were supplanted.

In the wake of looking through the primary volume, he was astonished to discover his suspicion wrong, and inferred that it was properly named. While he gives a to a great extent positive survey, Chavez finds the arrangement's work of art "basic" and unremarkable. He noticed that the main volume turns out to be somewhat monotonous, so applauds the manner in which that Kobayashi acquaints new subjects with the second, conveying assortment to the setting. Commenting on Kobayashi's capacity to draw on various impacts, Chavez acclaims the manga craftsman for finding crisp methods for utilizing old subjects, avoiding "School Rumble" from getting to be subsidiary. He holds his most astounding commendation for the "level" sections managing Yakumo. In the following two volumes Chavez endorses of the blend of satire and sentiment and the way the characters "grow up", despite the fact that recognizing that while the manga's style suits his own inclinations it won't be to everybody's taste.

Sakura Eries, likewise of Mania.com, gave volumes five, six, and eight to eleven positive evaluations by and large. She noticed that volume five may engage perusers progressively inspired by the side characters, and that valuing Kobayashi's cleverness in the second 50% of section eight "requires more mental exertion". In volume ten, she comments that while Kobayashi obtains the oft-utilized buzzword of an appalling school play, he figures out how to add enough curves to make it exceptional. The play's peak, be that as it may, befuddled her more than it diverted her. 

Carlo Santos, of Anime News Network, gave the English arrivals of volumes two, three, four, and seven blendedâyet to a great extent positiveâB-extend audits. Volume nine he grants a C rating.

In spite of volume nine's solid begin, by its end he relates that, in spite of the fact that there were some interesting minutes, he had turned out to be exhausted of its monotonous plot. A kindred analyst from Anime News Network, Carl Kimlinger, chose in the wake of auditing four volumes that while the early volumes don't help plot improvement, neither do they bring down the manga's intrigue; he too had a positive impression generally. Kimlinger found the later volumes better and all the more engaging, in spite of the fact that not continually amid the sentimental minutes.

Like the manga, the anime has been generally welcomed however does not stay away from analysis; specifically the nature of the activity for the two seasons, including the OVAs, has pulled in blended audits. A portion of the amusingness and sentimental components have been ridiculed while the English naming and soundtrack have been generally lauded. Most analysts took the position that, regardless of whether they despise certain components, the arrangement overall contains something that makes them need to see more; a view summed up by Chris Beveridge of Mania.com, who composes:

While "School Rumble" is commonly perceived as a shÅnen title focusing on the youthful male market, Katherine Luther, staff commentator for About.com, alludes to it as a shÅjo title went for young ladies and young ladies. Lisa Marie, commentator for RightStuf's "Anime Today" webcast, concurs that others, quite guys, might see the arrangement as shÅjo. Luther calls the principal DVD "the ideal class kickoff extra", while Marie describes "School Rumble" as "crazy", affirming it shows up superficially more laid back than different titles like "Exceed expectations Saga" and "HarÃ© + Guu". Notwithstanding, it utilizes its "cast to break...every guideline of the real world, however it plays everything so straight [that] it takes you a minute to acknowledge what coincidentally made any sense." An aficionado of the subgenre, she applauds the anime it for its dreamlike diversion, and for being "anime amateur benevolent" in that its jokes deal with different dimensions. Not all are of Japanese beginning, for example, a reference to the long triangular goals of Star Wars "'Return of the Jedi"â giving the arrangement expansive intrigue. 

Anime News Network's commentators discovered a lot to appreciate about the main arrangement, in spite of the fact that Theron Martin cautions that the principal DVD ought to be "viewed in little dosages, as attempting to handle a lot of it in one sitting will raise the suicide rate of your cerebrum cells". Carl Kimlinger remarks that "from the minute the words 'School Rumble' come turning onto the screen, you know you're in for ... undiluted great occasions", and that the title is "two of the best activity nonsensical conclusions you're probably going to see at any point in the near future". Carlo Santos acclaims volume six's strange satire, yet mourns its sentimental components as being excessively nonexclusive. Generally speaking, his rating is unremarkable, saying that "in spite of the fact that this circle in fact denotes the finish of [the first season of] "School Rumble", it's actually to a greater extent an interruption, seeing as how the last couple of scenes basically ride alongside the plot as opposed to attempt to achieve an emotional completion". Analysts from Mania.com pursued this example; Dani Moure was doubtful of the arrangement's long haul diversion esteem, however like individual commentator Danielle Van Gorder, discovered his initial lack of concern blurring as the story creates. IGN's Jeff Harris, N.S. Davidson, and David F. Smith gave for the most part positive surveys, in spite of the fact that Davidson trusts the sound and additional items had started to melt away by volume five. Jakub Lhota of Reanimated evaluated the main season a 8/10, expressing that he delighted in it more than some other anime arrangement he had recently viewed, and the styleâif not generally the shadingâof Funimation's metallic storage artbox for "School Rumble"s English interpretation of the principal season was invited. 

As indicated by Theron Martin, the OVA arrangement "School Rumble: Extra Class" was made for the most part for gave fans; guaranteeing that recognition with the arrangement is just about a need before watching it, in spite of the fact that he later went to the view that it might likewise be helpful as a sampler of the arrangement. Chris Beveridge gives the OVA arrangement a general negative audit. He didn't feature a solitary explicit reason, rather seeing that albeit all components that "make the TV arrangement charming are surely present here, they simply feel more fragile". Be that as it may, it made him need to observe a greater amount of the TV arrangement, therefore filling its planned need in keeping enthusiasm for the arrangement alive. Katherine Luther supported the view that watchers should be acquainted with the story, yet investigated the OVA emphatically. While she noted breaks in the activity, she trusts fans will most likely ignore this. In contrast to Martin, Luther did not trust the OVA is a decent prologue to "Class Rumble", because of its short groupings and apparently irregular nature. 

Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network declined to post analysis on the see declaration for the second season, guaranteeing "we accept on the off chance that you cherished "School Rumble", you're going to look at the continuation paying little respect to what anybody says, so why try auditing it?" David F. Smith from IGN gave the initial segment of season two a rating of 6/10, with lower scores for the Funimation additional items and higher ones for the plot and story. In particular, Smith commended the anime for never paying attention to itself, and the studio for not cutting its financial plan for sight chokesâsomething he takes note of that different organizations do. Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews found the second season amusing and nonrepetitive, and Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network applauded the second season for not fitting in with the traditions of the real world. She complimented it for concentrating more on different understudies and their connections than on the primary love triangle. Chris Beveridge guaranteed that, despite the fact that it runs over well, the season ought not be viewed in a long distance race sitting. He was progressively incredulous of Funimation's bundling, leaning toward the main season's metal storage boxart to the pressing for the half-season sets.
