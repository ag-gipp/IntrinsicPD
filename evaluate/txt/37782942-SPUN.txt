Spanish triumph of PetÃ©n 

The Spanish triumph of PetÃ©n was the last phase of the success of Guatemala, a drawn out clash amid the Spanish colonization of the Americas. A wide marsh plain secured with thick rainforest, PetÃ©n contains a focal seepage bowl with a progression of lakes and regions of savannah. It is crossed by a few scopes of low karstic slopes and ascends toward the south as it nears the Guatemalan Highlands. The victory of PetÃ©n, an area currently consolidated into the cutting edge republic of Guatemala, peaked in 1697 with the catch of NojpetÃ©n, the island capital of the Itza kingdom, by MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa y Arizmendi. With the annihilation of the Itza, the last autonomous and unconquered local kingdom in the Americas tumbled to European colonizers. 

Sizeable Maya populaces existed in PetÃ©n before the success, especially around the focal lakes and along the waterways. PetÃ©n was isolated into various Maya commonwealths occupied with a mind boggling web of collusions and ill wills. The most essential gatherings around the focal lakes were the Itza, the Yalain and the Kowoj. Different gatherings with regions in PetÃ©n incorporated the Kejache, the Acala, the Lakandon ChÊ¼ol, the Xocmo, the Chinamita, the Icaiche and the Manche ChÊ¼ol. 

PetÃ©n was first entered by HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s with a sizeable undertaking that crossed the domain from north to south in 1525. In the principal half of the sixteenth century, Spain set up neighboring provinces in YucatÃ¡n toward the north and Guatemala toward the south. Spanish preachers laid the foundation for the expansion of provincial organization in the outrageous south of PetÃ©n from 1596 onwards, however no further Spanish passage of focal PetÃ©n occurred until 1618 and 1619 when teachers touched base at the Itza capital, having gone from the Spanish town of MÃ©rida in YucatÃ¡n. 

In 1622 a military campaign set out from YucatÃ¡n driven by Captain Francisco de Mirones and joined by Franciscan monk Diego Delgado; this endeavor was a calamity, and the Spanish were slaughtered by the Itza. In 1628 the Manche ChÊ¼ol of the south were put under the organization of the frontier legislative head of Verapaz inside the Captaincy General of Guatemala. The Manche ChÊ¼ol ineffectively opposed Spanish control in 1633. In 1695 a military undertaking attempted to achieve Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ from Guatemala; this was followed in 1696 by evangelists from MÃ©rida and in 1697 by MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa's endeavor from YucatÃ¡n that brought about the last annihilation of the autonomous kingdoms of focal PetÃ©n and their joining into the Spanish Empire. 

The advanced division of PetÃ©n is situated in northern Guatemala. It is verged on the west by the Mexican territory of Chiapas; this outskirt to a great extent pursues the course of the Usumacinta River. On the north side PetÃ©n is flanked by the Mexican territory of Campeche and on the northwest by the Mexican province of Tabasco; PetÃ©n is verged on the east by Belize and on the south side by the Guatemalan divisions of Alta Verapaz and Izabal. 

The PetÃ©n marshes are shaped by a thickly forested low-lying limestone plain highlighting karstic geology. The territory is crossed by low eastâ west arranged edges of Cenozoic limestone and is described by an assortment of backwoods and soil types; water sources incorporate commonly little waterways and low-lying occasional marshes known as "bajos". A chain of fourteen lakes keeps running over the focal waste bowl of PetÃ©n; amid the stormy season a portion of these lakes become interconnected. This waste territory measures around eastâ west by northâ south. The biggest lake will be Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡, close to the focal point of the waste bowl; it quantifies . A wide savannah expands south of the focal lakes; it has a normal height of above mean ocean level with karstic edges achieving a normal elevation of . The savannah includes a reduced red earth soil that is too poor to even think about supporting substantial development, which brought about a moderately low dimension of pre-Columbian occupation. It is encompassed by slopes with abnormally soak southern slants and gentler northern methodologies; the slopes are secured with thick tropical woodland. Toward the north of the lakes area "bajos" become increasingly visit, scattered with woods. In the furthest north of PetÃ©n the Mirador Basin frames another inside waste locale. Toward the south PetÃ©n achieves a height of around as it ascends towards the Guatemalan Highlands and meets Paleozoic changeable rocks. 

The atmosphere of PetÃ©n is isolated into wet and dry seasons, with the blustery season enduring from June to December, despite the fact that these seasons are not plainly characterized in the south. The atmosphere fluctuates from tropical in the south to semitropical in the north; temperature shifts between , in spite of the fact that it doesn't ordinarily drop underneath . Mean temperature changes from in the southeast around PoptÃºn to around UaxactÃºn in the upper east. Most noteworthy temperatures are come to from April to June, and January is the coldest month; all PetÃ©n encounters a hot dry period in late August. Yearly precipitation is high, differing from a mean of in the upper east to in focal PetÃ©n around Flores (NojpetÃ©n). The extraordinary southeast of PetÃ©n encounters the biggest varieties in temperature and precipitation, with precipitation coming to as much as in a year. 

The principal huge Maya urban areas created in PetÃ©n as far back as the Middle Preclassic (c.Â 600â 350Â BC), and PetÃ©n shaped the heartland of the antiquated Maya progress amid the Classic time frame (c.Â ADÂ 250â 900). The incredible urban communities that ruled PetÃ©n had fallen into ruin by the start of the tenth century AD with the beginning of the Classic Maya breakdown. A critical Maya nearness stayed into the Postclassic time frame after the relinquishment of the significant Classic time frame urban communities; the populace was especially thought close lasting water sources. 

In spite of the fact that there is deficient information to precisely appraise populace sizes at the season of contact with the Spanish, early Spanish reports recommend that sizeable Maya populaces existed in PetÃ©n, especially around the focal lakes and along the streams. Before their thrashing in 1697 the Itza controlled or impacted a lot of PetÃ©n and parts of Belize. The Itza were warlike, and their military ability awed both neighboring Maya kingdoms and their Spanish adversaries. Their capital was NojpetÃ©n, an island city upon Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡; it has formed into the cutting edge town of Flores, which is the capital of the PetÃ©n branch of Guatemala. The Itza talked an assortment of Yucatecan Maya. 

The Kowoj were the second in significance, and they were antagonistic towards their Itza neighbors. The Kowoj were situated toward the east of the Itza, around the eastern lakes: Lake SalpetÃ©n, Lake MacanchÃ©, Lake YaxhÃ¡ and Lake Sacnab. Different gatherings are less notable, and their exact regional degree and political cosmetics stays cloud; among them were the Chinamita, the Kejache, the Icaiche, the Lakandon ChÊ¼ol, the Mopan, the Manche ChÊ¼ol and the Yalain. 

The Yalain seem to have been one of the three predominant countries in Postclassic focal PetÃ©n, close by the Itza and the Kowoj. The Yalain domain had its most extreme expansion from the east shore of Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ eastwards to Tipuj in Belize. In the seventeenth century the Yalain capital was situated at the site of that name on the north shore of Lake MacanchÃ©. At the season of Spanish contact the Yalain were aligned with the Itza, a union established by intermarriage between the elites of the two gatherings. In the late seventeenth century Spanish pilgrim records report threats between Maya bunches in the lakes area, with the invasion of the Kowoj into previous Yalain destinations including Zacpeten on Lake MacanchÃ© and Ixlu on Lake SalpetÃ©n. 

The Kejache involved a domain toward the north of the Itza, between the lakes and what is presently Campeche. Toward the west of them was Acalan, occupied by a Chontal Maya-talking bunch with their capital in the south of what is currently Campeche state. The ChÊ¼olan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not to be mistaken for the cutting edge occupants of Chiapas by that name) a controlled area along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River crossing southwestern PetÃ©n in Guatemala and eastern Chiapas. The Lakandon had a savage notoriety among the Spanish. The Xocmo were another ChÊ¼olan-talking gathering; they involved the remote backwoods some place toward the east of the Lakandon. Never vanquished, the Xocmo got away rehashed Spanish endeavors to find them and their inevitable destiny is obscure; they might be predecessors of the cutting edge Lacandon individuals. The Manche ChÊ¼ol held domain in the extraordinary south of what is currently the PetÃ©n office. The Mopan and the Chinamita had their commonwealths in the southeastern PetÃ©n. The Manche domain was toward the southwest of the Mopan. 

Christopher Columbus found the Americas for the Kingdom of Castile and LeÃ³n in 1492. By 1580 this had bound together with neighboring kingdoms to frame one Spanish kingdom. Private explorers from that point went into contracts with the Spanish Crown to vanquish the newfound grounds as a byproduct of duty incomes and the ability to run the show. In the principal decades after the revelation, the Spanish colonized the Caribbean and set up a focal point of activities on the island of Cuba. They heard gossipy tidbits about the rich domain of the Aztecs on the territory toward the west and, in 1519, HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s set sail with eleven boats to investigate the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had tumbled to the Spanish. Inside three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had vanquished a vast piece of Mexico, reaching out as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The recently vanquished domain turned out to be New Spain, headed by an emissary who offered an explanation to the Spanish Crown by means of the Council of the Indies. CortÃ©s despatched Pedro de Alvarado with a military to overcome the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighboring Pacific plain; the military period of the foundation of the Spanish settlement of Guatemala kept going from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and secured a wide region that additionally incorporated the Mexican province of Chiapas just as El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The Spanish forced pioneer rule over YucatÃ¡n somewhere in the range of 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the sixteenth to the seventeenth hundreds of years, leaving the territory betweenÂ â basically PetÃ©n and a lot of BelizeÂ â free long in the wake of encompassing people groups had been oppressed. 

A solitary officer touching base in Mexico in 1520 was conveying smallpox and consequently started the staggering infections that cleared through the local populaces of the Americas. The European ailments that attacked the indigenous occupants of the Americas likewise seriously influenced the different Maya gatherings of PetÃ©n. It is assessed that there were roughly 30,000 ChÊ¼ol and ChÊ¼oltiÊ¼ Maya in western PetÃ©n toward the beginning of the sixteenth century. Somewhere in the range of 1559 and 1721 they were crushed by a blend of infection, war and authorized migrations. 

At the point when NojpetÃ©n fell in 1696 there were roughly 60,000 Maya living around Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡, including a significant number of exiles from different territories. It is assessed that 88% of the occupants kicked the bucket amid the primary decade of pilgrim rule as a result of malady and war. In spite of the fact that sickness was in charge of most of passings, internecine fighting between adversary Maya gatherings and Spanish endeavors likewise incurred significant damage. 

Conquistadors frequently wore steel protection that included chainmail and caps. The Spanish were adequately awed by the knitted cotton shield of their Maya foes that they received it in inclination to their own steel defensive layer. Maya weaponry was not adequately incredible to legitimize the inconvenience of wearing European shield. Sewn cotton reinforcement, albeit still awkwardly hot, was adaptable and gauged substantially less. The Maya protective layer was adjusted by the Spanish, who utilized knee-length knitted cotton tunics and Spanish-style tops. Horsemen wore since quite a while ago knitted cotton leg defenders; their ponies were likewise ensured with cushioned cotton protective layer. After the last push to the PetÃ©n lakes in mid 1697, the Spanish recorded that they left with their battalion more than 50 Dutch-and French-made guns, three bore light guns ("piezas") cast from iron and mounted on carriages, four iron and two bronze "pedreros" (2-loaded stone-launchers) and six of something like eight bronze light guns (known as "esmiriles"). 

The Spanish portrayed the weapons of war of the PetÃ©n Maya as bows and bolts, discharge honed posts, stone headed lances and two-gave swords known as "hadzab" that were created from solid wood with the sharp edge formed from inset obsidian; these were like the Aztec "macuahuitl". They had a dainty, wide wooden shaft with obsidian or stone edges set into directs in the wood. The pole was up to long and was made from the hard, dim wood of a blooming tree ("Apoplanesia paniculata") called "chulul" by the Maya. The bows utilized by the Maya were portrayed as nearly as high as a man and were produced using the equivalent "chulul" wood as the "hadzab", with the bowstring molded from henequen fiber; the bow was known as a "chuhul". Bolts were produced using reeds with rock, bone or fishtooth sharpened stones and flights created from plumes. Close by to-hand battle the Maya utilized knifes with obsidian or stone edges set into a "chulul"- wood handle, they were about long. Maya lances were alluded to as "nabte"; in some cases the tip was fire-solidified, here and there they were set with a stone cutting edge. Lances were chiefly used to push and cut yet they could likewise be tossed as a lance. The Maya utilized a few unique sizes of lance with the littler lances most likely utilized as a rocket; the more drawn out lances were a comparative size as those utilized by the Spanish. 

Recognized Maya warriors entered fight wearing defensive layer. The chest area was secured by a short coat that was loaded up with shake salt, and the lower arms and legs were ensured with tight ties of fabric or cowhide. The salt-stuffed cotton covering was extreme enough that even bolts couldn't infiltrate it. Protection could be finished and was frequently decorated with quills. Normal people did not wear covering in fight, generally just wearing an undergarment and warpaint. Warriors conveyed shields produced using two right-calculated wooden bars with deerskin extended crosswise over them. 

The Spanish knew that the Itza Maya had turned into the focal point of against Spanish obstruction and occupied with an arrangement of circling their kingdom and cutting their exchange courses through the span of right around two hundred years. The Itza opposed this enduring infringement by enlisting their neighbors as partners against the Spanish development. The Spanish occupied with a methodology of moving local populaces in recently established frontier towns, or "reducciones" (otherwise called "congregaciones"). Local protection from the new nucleated settlements appeared as the trip of the indigenous occupants into distant areas, for example, the woodland or joining neighboring Maya bunches that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that stayed behind in the "reducciones" regularly succumbed to infectious illnesses. 

Notwithstanding military endeavors, an agreement for success was issued to the Dominican Order, which connected with preachers for the tranquil placation of local populaces so they would acknowledge Roman Catholicism and submit to Spanish standard. This strategy worked in the neighboring piles of Verapaz toward the south, in spite of the fact that their prosperity there was supported by the risk of Spanish armies positioned inside striking separation. In the swamp PetÃ©n this methodology was not all that fruitful, since the Maya could vanish effectively into the rainforest leaving the Spanish with betrayed settlements. In like manner, the Franciscan Order occupied with commonly serene endeavors to consolidate the Maya into the Spanish Empire by means of the endeavored Christian change of local pioneers. The Franciscan Order routinely grasped the act of evangelist viciousness, including beating and the guard of the possibility of "sacred war" against non-Christians. As a rule the Maya stayed Christian just while the evangelists were available, and they would promptly end up renegade when the monks left. In Guatemala in the late seventeenth century, the Franciscan monk Francisco de AsÃ­s VÃ¡zquez de Herrera contended that war against defector Indians was required. Minister infiltration of PetÃ©n was not hazard free, and numerous evangelists were slaughtered in the district. 

Autonomous Maya much of the time assaulted Christianised Maya settlements and urged such settlements to forsake their new religion and oppose the Spanish. As Spanish military undertakings were propelled against the Maya with expanding recurrence, free Maya people group started to demand the nearness of ministers to stay away from equipped clash. The Itza endeavored to utilize neighboring Maya gatherings, for example, the Yalain, as a support against Spanish infringement; they may likewise have incited uprisings by neighboring gatherings that were at that point experiencing joining into the Spanish Empire. With Spanish endeavors to infiltrate the district partitioned between commonly free pioneer experts in YucatÃ¡n and Guatemala, on occasion the Itza would make tranquil suggestions on one front while battling on the other. 

In 1525, after the Spanish triumph of the Aztec Empire, HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s drove a campaign to Honduras over land, cutting over the Itza kingdom in what is presently the northern PetÃ©n Department of Guatemala. His point was to repress the defiant CristÃ³bal de Olid, whom he had sent to vanquish Honduras; Olid had set himself up freely on his entry in that domain. CortÃ©s had 140 Spanish officers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 steeds, a crowd of pigs, cannons, weapons and different supplies. He additionally had with him 600 Chontal Maya transporters from Acalan. They touched base at the north shore of Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ on 13 March 1525. 

The Roman Catholic clerics going with the undertaking commended mass within the sight of Aj Kan EkÊ¼, the lord of the Itza, who was said to be impressed to the point that he promised to adore the cross and to annihilate his deities. CortÃ©s acknowledged a welcome from Kan EkÊ¼ to visit NojpetÃ©n (otherwise called Tayasal), and crossed to the Maya city with 20 Spanish warriors while the remainder of his military proceeded around the lake to meet him on the south shore. On his takeoff from NojpetÃ©n, CortÃ©s left behind a cross and a weak steed that the Itza treated as a divinity, endeavoring to encourage it poultry, meat and blossoms, however the creature soon kicked the bucket. The Spanish did not formally contact the Itza again until the entry of Franciscan clerics in 1618, when CortÃ©s' cross was said to in any case be remaining at NojpetÃ©n. 

From the lake, CortÃ©s proceeded with south along the western inclines of the Maya Mountains, an especially challenging voyage that took 12 days to cover , amid which he lost more than 66% of his steeds. When he went to a waterway swollen with the steady exuberant downpours that had been falling amid the campaign, CortÃ©s swung upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more ponies. 

On 15 April 1525 the campaign touched base at the Maya town of Tenciz. With nearby aides they headed into the slopes north of Lake Izabal, where their aides relinquished them to their destiny. The undertaking ended up lost in the slopes and approached starvation before they caught a Maya kid who drove them to security. CortÃ©s found a town on the shore of Lake Izabal, maybe Xocolo. He crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, some place on the Amatique Bay, with around twelve allies, and sat tight there for the remainder of his military to regroup throughout the following week. At this point the leftovers of the undertaking had been decreased to a couple of hundred; CortÃ©s prevailing with regards to reaching the Spaniards he was scanning for, just to find that CristÃ³bal de Olid's own officers had just put down his insubordination. CortÃ©s then came back to Mexico via ocean. 

From 1527 onwards the Spanish were progressively dynamic in the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula, setting up a few states and towns by 1544, incorporating Campeche and Valladolid in what is currently Mexico. The Spanish effect on the northern Maya, including intrusion, pestilence maladies and the fare of up to 50,000 Maya slaves, made numerous Maya escape southwards to join the Itza around Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡, inside the cutting edge fringes of Guatemala. 

Dominican preachers were dynamic in Verapaz and the southern PetÃ©n from the late sixteenth century through the seventeenth century, endeavoring peaceful change with restricted achievement. In the seventeenth century, the Franciscans arrived at the resolution that the assuagement and Christian transformation of the Maya would not be conceivable as long as the Itza held out at Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡. The steady stream of escapees escaping the Spanish-held domains to discover shelter with the Itza was a channel on the workforce overseen by the "encomienda" framework. 

The principal Catholic teachers entered southern PetÃ©n in 1596 to change over the Manche ChÊ¼ol and the Mopan. The QÊ¼eqchiÊ¼ of Verapaz long had close ties with the Manche ChÊ¼ol. The pilgrim Maya towns of CobÃ¡n and CahabÃ³n, in Alta Verapaz, exchanged quetzal quills, copal, chile, cotton, salt and Spanish-delivered iron devices with their swamp Lakandon and Manche ChÊ¼ol neighbors, accepting cacao and achiote in return. Numerous QÊ¼eqchiÊ¼ from Verapaz fled Spanish control to settle among the LakandÃ³n and Manche ChÊ¼ol. These escapees reinforced the current ties between the autonomous ChÊ¼ol and the Spanish-controlled Maya of Verapaz; the steady stream of Maya between provincial Verapaz and free PetÃ©n prompted religious syncretism that the Spanish religious experts were unfit to counteract. This relationship did not impede the Spanish from utilizing the QÊ¼eqchiÊ¼ to help vanquish and lessen the Manche ChÊ¼ol. 

From the center of the sixteenth century the Dominican Order had been entrusted with the serene transformation of the ChÊ¼ol of Verapaz and southern PetÃ©n, and their focus into new pilgrim towns. The Itza ended up frightful that the recently changed over Manche ChÊ¼ol would lead the Spanish to NojpetÃ©n. In 1628 the towns of the Manche ChÊ¼ol were set under the organization of the legislative head of Verapaz, with Dominican monk Francisco MorÃ¡n as their clerical head. MorÃ¡n favored a progressively powerful way to deal with the change of the Manche and moved Spanish officers into the locale to shield against assaults from the Itza toward the north. The new Spanish battalion in a zone that had not recently observed a substantial Spanish military nearness incited the Manche to revolt, which was trailed by deserting of the indigenous settlements. The Itza, stressed over the southern ways to deal with their region, may have affected a Manche resistance that occurred in Lent 1633. 

Towards the finish of the seventeenth century Spanish needs changed, and the disappointment of the serene endeavors of the Dominicans to change over the ChÊ¼ol joined with the expanding British nearness in the Caribbean drove the frontier specialists to end the Dominican imposing business model and enable the Franciscans and different requests to enter the locale; military choices were likewise seen all the more positively. Somewhere in the range of 1685 and 1689, the QÊ¼eqchiÊ¼ of CobÃ¡n and CahabÃ³n were compelled to help the Spanish in their furnished campaigns against the Manche ChÊ¼ol and in persuasively migrating them to Verapaz. These activities eradicated the southern PetÃ©n and prompted the breakdown of the exchange courses connecting provincial Guatemala with the autonomous Maya of PetÃ©n. From 1692 to 1694, Franciscan ministers Antonio Margil and Melchor LÃ³pez were dynamic among the Manche and Lakandon ChÊ¼ol. They were in the end ousted by the ChÊ¼ol; upon their arrival to Santiago de Guatemala they proposed three intrusion courses into southern PetÃ©n and neighboring Chiapas. All through the seventeenth century, Spanish teachers experienced impressive hesitance among the Manche, until the Spanish at long last chose to move them to a territory where they could be all the more effectively controlled. At the season of contact there were maybe 10,000 Manche; these were crushed by war and sickness, with the survivors migrated to Rabinal in the cutting edge branch of Baja Verapaz. After 1700 the Manche ChÊ¼ol stopped to have any influence in the historical backdrop of PetÃ©n. 

The Mopan populace has been evaluated at somewhere in the range of 10,000 and 20,000 individuals at the season of contact. In 1692 the Council of the Indies requested that the Manche ChÊ¼ol and the Mopan be managed unequivocally. The populace endured the impacts of war and infection, and the couple of survivors were moved into Spanish "reducciones" in southeastern PetÃ©n, before being moved to pilgrim settlements in different pieces of PetÃ©n. In 1695 the provincial specialists chose to follow up on an arrangement to interface the territory of Guatemala with YucatÃ¡n, and warriors directed by Jacinto de Barrios Leal, leader of the Royal Audiencia of Guatemala, vanquished a few ChÊ¼ol people group. The most vital of these was SakbÊ¼ajlan on the LacantÃºn River in eastern Chiapas, presently in Mexico, which was renamed as Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon, in April 1695. This was one piece of a three-pronged assault against the autonomous occupants of PetÃ©n and neighboring Chiapas; a second gathering cooperated with Barrios Leal having walked from Huehuetenango. The third gathering, under Juan DÃ­az de Velasco, walked from Verapaz against the Itza. Barrios Leal was joined by Franciscan minister Antonio Margil who filled in as a counselor just as his own questioner and cleric to his troops. The Spanish assembled a fortress and garrisoned it with 30 Spanish officers. Mercederian minister Diego de Rivas was based at Dolores del Lakandon, and he and his individual Mercederians purified through water a few hundred Lakandon ChÊ¼ols in the next months and set up contacts with neighboring ChÊ¼ol people group. 

Opposition against the Spanish proceeded, and threatening ChÊ¼ol murdered a few recently sanctified through water Christian Indians. Toward the beginning of March 1696 such was the accomplishment of the monks that chief Jacobo de Alzayaga and the Mercederians chose to attempt to achieve Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡. They traveled eastwards towards the PasiÃ³n River with 150 intensely furnished troopers in addition to local aides, going in five substantial kayaks. They got similar to the savannah toward the southeast of the lake before turning back for obscure reasons. Antonio Margil stayed in Dolores del Lakandon until 1697. The ChÊ¼ol of the Lacandon Jungle were resettled in Huehuetenango in the mid eighteenth century. 

NojpetÃ©n tumbled to a Spanish ambush on 13 March 1697, over 150 years after the triumph of the remainder of the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula and over 160 years after the success of the Guatemalan Highlands. The extensive deferral in vanquishing the PetÃ©n locale was because of a mix of its topographical remoteness and inhospitality and the savage notoriety of its Maya occupants. Amid this time the Itza utilized the Yalain as an eastern cradle against Spanish methodology from Belize. The long roundabout contact between the Itza and the Spanish trespassers enabled the Itza to build up a comprehension of Spanish procedure and strategies that was sharpened over the time of very nearly two centuries that the Itza were encompassed by European-ruled domains. This understanding recognized the triumph of PetÃ©n from the sixteenth century victories of the Aztecs, Maya and Incas. Conversely, the Spanish had an exceptionally poor comprehension of the Itza and their neighbors and saw them as oblivious savages whose kingdom was shielded by Satan from the Christianising endeavors of the Spanish Empire and the Roman Catholic Church. From the time that HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s crossed PetÃ©n in the mid sixteenth century, the Spanish erroneously trusted the lord of the Itza (the "Aj Kan Ek"') was the overlord of the whole focal PetÃ©n area. 

Following CortÃ©s' visit, no Spanish endeavored to visit the warlike Itza occupants of NojpetÃ©n for just about a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan monks set out from MÃ©rida in YucatÃ¡n set for endeavor the serene change of the still agnostic Itza in focal PetÃ©n. BartolomÃ© de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were joined by some Christianised Maya. AndrÃ©s Carrillo de PernÃ­a, a "Criollo" who was the "alcalde" of Bacalar (a pioneer official), joined the gathering at Bacalar and escorted them upriver to the extent Tipuj, coming back to Bacalar once he was sure of the monks accepting a decent welcome there. Following a difficult half year venture the explorers were generally welcomed by the current Kan EkÊ¼. They remained at NojpetÃ©n for some days trying to proselytize the Itza, however the Aj Kan EkÊ¼ would not disavow his Maya religion, in spite of the fact that he demonstrated enthusiasm for the majority held by the Catholic teachers. Kan EkÊ¼ educated them that as indicated by antiquated Itza prescience it was not yet time for them to change over. In the time since CortÃ©s had visited NojpetÃ©n, the Itza had made a statue of the revered pony. Juan de Orbita was shocked when he saw the icon and he quickly crushed it into pieces. Fuensalida had the capacity to spare the lives of the guests from the chafed locals by methods for an especially articulate lesson that brought about them being excused. Endeavors to change over the Itza fizzled, and the ministers left NojpetÃ©n on well disposed terms with Kan EkÊ¼. 

The monks returned in 1619, touching base in October and remaining for eighteen days. Again Kan EkÊ¼ invited them in a well disposed way, yet this time the Maya organization were threatening and envious of the evangelists' impact upon the lord. They influenced Kan Ek's significant other to persuade him to remove the unwelcome guests. The preachers' lodgings were encompassed by outfitted warriors, and the ministers and their going with hirelings were escorted to a holding up kayak and trained to leave and stay away for the indefinite future. Juan de Orbita endeavored to oppose and was rendered oblivious by an Itza warrior. The preachers were removed without nourishment or water yet endure the adventure back to MÃ©rida. 

Prior to the mid seventeenth century, the western PetÃ©n had been intensely populated by ChÊ¼ol and ChÊ¼oltiÊ¼ Maya and was a vital exchange course for the Itza. By the mid-seventeenth century, these populaces had been crushed by war, malady and the authorized development of the occupants into frontier settlements, refuting the monetary significance of the locale for the Itza. In the meantime the Kejache were getting to be vital delegates between the Itza and YucatÃ¡n. The Putun Acalan subgroup of the Kejache had recently exchanged legitimately with the Itza yet had been migrated by the Spanish. The remaining Kejache, crushed by malady and subject to the exceptional considerations of Spanish ministers, were never again ready to supply the Itza legitimately and progressed toward becoming brokers. 

In March 1622, legislative leader of YucatÃ¡n Diego de Cardenas requested skipper Francisco de Mirones Lezcano to dispatch an attack upon the Itza; he set out from YucatÃ¡n with 20 Spanish fighters and 80 Mayas from YucatÃ¡n. His campaign was later joined by Franciscan minister Diego Delgado. The undertaking initially stayed outdoors at IxPimienta; in May they moved to Sakalum, southwest of Bacalar, where there was an extensive postponement while they sat tight for fortifications. In transit to NojpetÃ©n, Delgado trusted that the officers' treatment of the Maya was unreasonably coldblooded, and he left the endeavor to make his own specific manner to NojpetÃ©n with eighty Christianised Maya from Tipuj in Belize. Meanwhile the Itza had educated of the moving toward military endeavor and had turned out to be solidified against further Spanish minister endeavors. At the point when Mirones scholarly of Delgado's takeoff, he sent 13 fighters to convince him to return or proceed as his escort should he deny. The troopers made up for lost time with him just before Tipuj, however he was resolved to reach NojpetÃ©n. From Tipuj, Delgado sent a dispatcher to Kan EkÊ¼, requesting that consent travel to NojpetÃ©n; the Itza lord answered with a guarantee of safe section for the teacher and his partners. The gathering was at first gotten in harmony at the Itza capital, however when the Spanish officers let their watchman down, the Itza seized and bound the fresh debuts. The warriors were yielded to the Maya divine beings, with their souls cut from their chests and their heads speared on stakes around the town. After the penance of the Spanish officers, the Itza took Delgado, cut his heart out and eviscerated him; they showed his head on a stake with the others. The destiny of the pioneer of Delgado's Maya partners was no better. With no word from Delgado's escort, Mirones sent two Spanish officers with Bernardino Ek, a Maya scout, to get familiar with their destiny. When they touched base upon the shore of Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡, the Itza took them crosswise over to their island capital and detained them. They disappeared to a kayak by the lakeshore yet the two Spanish, hindered by their bonds, were before long recovered. Ek got away and came back to Mirones with the news. 

Before long thereafter, on 27 January 1624, an Itza war party driven by AjKÊ¼in PÊ¼ol found Mirones and his fighters napping and unarmed in the congregation at Sakalum and butchered them. Spanish fortifications driven by Juan Bernardo Casanova arrived past the point of no return; the Spanish fighters had been yielded, hanged and guillotined, with their cadavers consumed and pierced on stakes at the passageway to the town; Mirones and the Franciscan minister had been bound to the congregation posts and afterward relinquished with their souls cut out. Various neighborhood Maya people had likewise been hanged yet not executed, and the aggressors had consumed the town. 

Following these slaughters, Spanish armies were positioned in a few towns in southern YucatÃ¡n, and prizes were offered for the whereabouts of AjKÊ¼in PÊ¼ol. The Maya legislative head of Oxkutzcab, Fernando Kamal, set out with 150 Maya bowmen to follow the warleader down; they prevailing with regards to catching the Itza commander and his devotees, together with flatware from the plundered Sakalum church and things having a place with Mirones. The detainees were reclaimed to the Spanish skipper Antonio MÃ©ndez de Canzo, grilled under torment, attempted, and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. They were executed, and the heads were shown in the courts of towns all through the pioneer "Partido de la Sierra" in what is presently Mexico's YucatÃ¡n state. These occasions finished every Spanish endeavor to contact the Itza until 1695. During the 1640s inner struggle in Spain diverted the legislature from endeavors to overcome obscure terrains; the Spanish Crown came up short on the time, cash or enthusiasm for such pilgrim undertakings for the following four decades. 

In 1692 Basque aristocrat MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa y Arizmendi proposed to the Spanish lord the development of a street from MÃ©rida southwards to connect with the Guatemalan province, in the process "lessening" any free local populaces into pioneer "congregaciones"; this was a piece of a more prominent arrangement to enslave the Lakandon and Manche ChÊ¼ol of southern PetÃ©n and the upper ranges of the Usumacinta River. The first arrangement was for the area of YucatÃ¡n to construct the northern segment and for Guatemala to fabricate the southern bit, with both gathering some place in ChÊ¼ol domain; the arrangement was later changed to pass further east, through the kingdom of the Itza. 

In December 1695 the Spanish frontier experts in MÃ©rida got a conciliatory visit sent by the Aj Kan EkÊ¼. The political contact had been consulted by Spanish commander Francisco Hariza y Arruyo, "alcalde" of Bacalar-at-ChunjujubÊ¼. Hariza had sent a Christian Maya minister to NojpetÃ©n from Tipuj in April 1695, who touched base around a similar time that the Itza were planning to protect themselves against a Spanish gathering entering from Guatemala; in any case the emissary was gotten in harmony and despatched back to Hariza with guarantees of accommodation to Spain. In August Hariza headed out to MÃ©rida in the organization of a gathering of seven Tipuj locals offering accommodation to Spain. Four individuals from this gathering were not from Tipuj by any stretch of the imagination, however were Itza representatives sent in secret from Yalain to talk about conceivable quiet contacts with the provincial specialists. The pioneer of the Itza designation was AjChan, a nephew of the Itza ruler. At the point when minister AvendaÃ±o was in MÃ©rida in September 1695 between endeavors to reach NojpetÃ©n, he met with the Itzaâ Yalain assignment and had the capacity to give a record of them when he went through Yalain in the wake of visiting NojpetÃ©n in January 1696. AjChan and his partners came back to NojpetÃ©n in November yet did not remain well before leaving for MÃ©rida once more. 

In December, Kan EkÊ¼ despatched AjChan to arrange harmony with Spain, with three Itza colleagues. They were joined to MÃ©rida by few Mopans from the Tipuj locale. AjChan, through family ties and marriage, had a key job as a broker between the Itza, Yalain and Kowoj; he additionally had family ties with the semi-Christianised Maya at Tipuj, and his mom was from Chichen Itza in the northern YucatÃ¡n. His marriage to a Kowoj lady had been an endeavor, at last fruitless, to defuse Itzaâ Kowoj antagonistic vibe. Kan EkÊ¼ sent AjChan to MÃ©rida with a message of serene accommodation to the Spanish Empire trying to harden his very own situation as sole leader of the Itza, regardless of whether this implied relinquishing Itza freedom from Spain. The Itza lord's uncle and the Kowoj were generally restricted to any dealings with the Spanish and saw AjChan's government office as bad form. The Spanish were ignorant of the pressures between various Maya groups in focal PetÃ©n, which at this point had swelled into a condition of between Maya fighting. AjChan was absolved as MartÃ­n Francisco on 31 December 1695, with MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa, legislative head of YucatÃ¡n, going about as his back up parent. 

The entry of AjChan and his consequent submersion was an imperative strategic upset for UrsÃºa, who utilized the visit for his very own political progression, advancing the international safe haven as the quiet last accommodation of the Itza kingdom to the Spanish Crown. This formal accommodation of the Itza kingdom to Spain was a basic defining moment, since from a Spanish legitimate perspective the Itza were currently subjects and the illustrious disallowance on military victory could be avoided. AjChan left MÃ©rida with his allies and a Spanish escort amidst January 1696 and touched base back at Tipuj around the month's end. Following a couple of days at Tipuj he learnt of rough occasions unfurling around Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ including the fight at ChÊ¼ichÊ¼ and the resulting killing of two Franciscans. Dreading the reaction of his Spanish escort, he relinquished them and fled back to Yalain. 

The legislative head of YucatÃ¡n, MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa y Arizmendi, started to manufacture the street from Campeche south towards PetÃ©n. Toward the start of March 1695, UrsÃºa requested chief Alonso GarcÃ­a de Paredes to investigate this street; GarcÃ­a drove a gathering of 50 Spanish troopers, joined by local aides, muleteers and workers. GarcÃ­a had past understanding from military campaigns around SajkabÊ¼chen (close present day Xcabacab in southern Campeche express) The undertaking propelled some route south of SajkabÊ¼chen into Kejache domain, which started at Chunpich, about north of the advanced fringe among Mexico and Guatemala. He gathered together a few locals to be moved into pioneer settlements, however met with outfitted Kejache obstruction. An encounter followed at a Kejache town, bringing about the passings of eight Kejache warriors. Detainees taken amid the engagement educated GarcÃ­a that numerous autonomous Maya lived in the territory, both Kejache and others. GarcÃ­a chose to withdraw around the center of April, likely to escort caught Kejache back to SajkabÊ¼chen to be given something to do on GarcÃ­a's "encomienda". Commander GarcÃ­a detailed back to UrsÃºa on 21 April 1695. 

In March 1695, chief Juan DÃ­az de Velasco set out from CahabÃ³n in Alta Verapaz with 70 Spanish fighters, joined by a substantial number of Maya toxophilite from Verapaz, and local muleteers; four Dominican ministers driven by "Criollo" monk AgustÃ­n Cano went with the undertaking. Hypothetically the Spanish troopers were given exclusively as an escort to the Dominicans. The Guatemalan campaign, compelled of President Jacinto de Barrios Leal, were furtively endeavoring to achieve the Itzas before MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa could contact them from YucatÃ¡n; the presence of the undertaking was deliberately covered amid all correspondences among Guatemala and the legislative head of YucatÃ¡n. It shaped a piece of a three-pronged assault against the free occupants of PetÃ©n and neighboring Chiapas; the other two campaigns were propelled against the Lakandon. 

The campaign continued northwards through ChÊ¼ol domain and into Mopan region; there they stayed outdoors at Mopan town (present day San Luis). Because of their dread of their warlike Itza neighbors, both the ChÊ¼ol and the Mopans asserted not to know about any ways to Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡. The Spanish were held up at Mopan for a few days by supply issues and abandonments among their local transporters. The Dominicans exploited the postponement to convert the Mopans and Cano composed that he had changed over four "caciques" (local boss) there, in spite of the fact that Taxim Chan, lord of the Mopans, had fled with a considerable lot of the neighborhood occupants. Cano trusted that the Mopans were governed by the lord of the Itzas. 

The Spanish trusted that by squeezing ahead to Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ they would connect up with a concurrent undertaking headed by President Barrios himself, uninformed that Barrios had not achieved the locale. DÃ­az de Velasco conveyed an exploring gathering of 50 musketeers joined by local bowmen on 6 April. They before long discovered proof of late Itza camps in the zone, evaluated to be a month old. The scouts found a reasonable street traveling north to the Itza kingdom, and the military set off along it. The primary power stayed outdoors around ten associations (26Â miles or 42Â km) south of the lake, while a littler exploring party was sent off ahead; this comprised of two Spanish officers, two bowmen and two muleteers from Verapaz, with two ChÊ¼ol-talking local translators. The exploring party progressed to the savannah just toward the south of Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡, where they experienced around 30 Itza seekers equipped with lances, shields and quits, chasing hounds. The seekers drew their weapons and arranged to battle, yet the Mopan translator was told to clarify that the Spanish party were dealers who came in harmony, joined by ministers. The Spanish started to presume that the translator was plotting against them with the Itza seekers, and one of the Verapaz bowmen hauled him out from among the seekers. The experience declined into a fight, and the Itzas by and by drew weapons. The Spanish terminated their black powder rifles, lethally injuring two seekers, and a Verapaz Indian accused the Itzas of a cleaver. The seekers fled, leaving the exploring party possessing the nourishment and bolts at the chasing camp. 

Five days after this encounter, Antonio Machuca drove a gathering of 12 musketeers, 25 bowmen and 13 muleteers to endeavor to discover President Barrios, to scout a waterway course to the lake and to catch another mediator, the past one never again being trusted. The primary party landed on the savannah close to the lake. The next night one of the development party returned into camp with an Itza detainee, caught after a wild battle with the scouts. Cross examination of the detainee uncovered that he was from a high-positioning Itza genealogy, and that he had been conveyed to locate the Spanish party and to check whether they came as merchants or trespassers. The remainder of Machuca's exploring party before long come back to the primary camp, detailing that they had stayed outdoors four classes (roughly 10.4Â miles or 16.7Â km) from the lake, where they experienced another chasing gathering of around "twelve" Itzas. The Spanish endeavored to utilize their translator to converse with them yet the Itzas reacted with a volley of bolts. The Spanish musketeers endeavored to react with musketfire, yet found their black powder too wet to even consider firing legitimately. The Itza warriors endless supply of lances, tomahawks and blades, and the resulting hand-to-hand fight endured 60 minutes, amid which six of the Itzas were killed; the rest at long last withdrew. Because of their cushioned cotton shield, the Spanish party got no wounds from the conflict. The Spanish sought after the escaping Itzas and another savage clash resulted, enduring one more hour amid which the vast majority of the remaining Itzas were killed. Three Itzas got away, and their pioneer was rendered oblivious with cleaver hits to the head; he was taken prisoner and later made a full recuperation. Machuca's gathering achieved the lakeshore and could see NojpetÃ©n over the water, yet observed such an extensive power of Itzas that they withdrew south, back to the fundamental camp. 

An Itza record of this experience achieved the pilgrim experts in YucatÃ¡n through Tipuj. The Itza revealed that the Guatemalan party drew closer on horseback to inside sight of NojpetÃ©n, and around thirty inquisitive Itzas assembled to converse with the interlopers, whereupon they were assaulted by the Spanish, bringing about the passings of thirty Itzas, the catch of one but then increasingly injured. A Christian Maya emissary from Bacalar-at-ChunjujubÊ¼, YucatÃ¡n, was in NojpetÃ©n around this time, and revealed that the Itza accumulated 3,000â 4,000 warriors prepared to shock DÃ­az de Velasco's gathering. 

On 24 April, the principal detainee got away from the fundamental camp; that day that the harmed second detainee was taken in by Machuca and his men. Cross examination of the new detainee, who ended up being an Itza aristocrat, uncovered that the Itza kingdom was in a condition of high cognizant to repulse the Spanish. Monk Cano met with his kindred Dominicans to talk about what ought to be done, having had data from both Machuca and his detainee that the Itza were prepared for war. The Dominicans were profoundly condemning of the Spanish officers' preparation to start shooting at inadequately outfitted locals who offered no genuine danger to them, and suspected that President Barrios was not even close to the lake; moreover the Spanish were starting to capitulate to ailment, and the Verapaz Indian enlisted people were forsaking every day. DÃ­az concurred with the Dominicans; two muleteers had as of now passed on from affliction, and he perceived that the extent of his endeavor was not adequate for a full showdown with the Itza country. The campaign very quickly pulled back to CahabÃ³n. The new detainee, AjKÊ¼ixaw was later reclaimed to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, where the Dominicans addressed him in detail. In Guatemala AjKÊ¼ixaw learnt Spanish and came back to PetÃ©n in 1696 as a guide and translator for another endeavor, before turning on his captors. After the Spanish withdrew to Guatemala, bits of gossip ran overflowing among the Itza and Kowoj that they would come back to participate in discount butcher of the Maya populace; expansive tracts of region were surrendered accordingly, incorporating numerous towns in a zone extending from Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ eastwards to Tipuj and southwards to MopÃ¡n. 

At the point when skipper GarcÃ­a de Paredes surprisingly came back to Campeche toward the beginning of May 1695, representative MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa was at that point getting ready fortifications for his endeavor. With GarcÃ­a's entry, he was promptly allotted the additional troopers. On 11 May UrsÃºa requested GarcÃ­a to start a second undertaking southwards and was assigned 100 salaried Maya to go with him. These laborers were to be paid three pesos for every month and got a suspension of their commitments to supply "encomienda" work and tribute. GarcÃ­a paid for extra Spanish officers from his very own assets, as did JosÃ© FernÃ¡ndez de Estenos, a Campeche occupant who was to fill in as second-in-order. The last power numbered 115 Spanish fighters and 150 Maya musketeers, in addition to Maya workers and muleteers; the last count was in excess of 400 individuals, which was viewed as an impressive armed force in the devastated YucatÃ¡n region. UrsÃºa additionally requested two organizations of Maya musketeers from TekÊ¼ax and OxkÊ¼utzkabÊ¼ to join the campaign at BÊ¼olonchÊ¼en Kawich, some southeast of the city of Campeche. Bonifacio Us was chief of the TekÊ¼ax organization; Diego Uk was that of the OxkÊ¼utzkabÊ¼ organization. Marcos Pot was by and large "cacique chief" of these two Maya organizations; every one of the three officers were Maya. A Maya organization from SajkabÊ¼chen filled in as tip top musketeers accused of gathering together backwoods Maya into the "reducciones"; this organization was pardoned from overwhelming work obligations. Non-Maya troopers were a blend of Spanish, mestizos (blended race Spanish and local) and mulattos (blended race Spanish and dark). 

On 18 May UrsÃºa mentioned three evangelists to help the endeavor from the Franciscan common predominant, minister Antonio de Silva; by 30 May three monks were prepared to join the Spanish power, joined by a lay sibling who had not yet taken promises. Also, Silva sent another gathering of Franciscans driven by minister AndrÃ©s de AvendaÃ±o, who was joined by another monk and a lay sibling. This second gathering was just to stay with GarcÃ­a while advantageous for them to do as such, and were to proceed onwards freely to NojpetÃ©n to reach the Itzas, with the unsaid endorsement of UrsÃºa. Actually AvendaÃ±o and his gathering left MÃ©rida on 2 June, seven days before the gathering doled out to GarcÃ­a. On 23 June UrsÃºa got a message educating him of the control of SakbÊ¼ajlan (Dolores del Lakandon) by Guatemalan troops. At this point GarcÃ­a was at TzuktokÊ¼, close to the Kejache outskirt. In spite of the fact that UrsÃºa's indicated arrangement, as approved by the Spanish crown, was to assemble a street joining YucatÃ¡n with Guatemala, he presently understood that he was in a race to vanquish the Itza kingdom; President Barrios of Guatemala had come to SakbÊ¼ajlan and was coming back to Santiago to set up another undertaking, and Guatemalan warriors had just achieved the lakeshore of PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡. Any connecting street to Dolores del Lakandon would have gone through a scantily occupied area; rather the Yucatecan surveyor plotted a course due south straightforwardly to the lake where it could interface with the south street by means of CahabÃ³n in Verapaz. This course would leave Dolores del Lakandon and the Lakandon ChÊ¼ol detached toward the west. UrsÃºa issued new requests to GarcÃ­a dissimulating his longing to vanquish the Itza. His letter requested GarcÃ­a to interface up with President Barrios at Dolores del Lakandon, and gave him an exact course that would take him rather to the lake. A brief timeframe subsequent to accepting these requests, GarcÃ­a requested the development of a fortress at Chuntuki, somewhere in the range of 25 alliances (around 65Â miles or 105Â km) north of Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡. This would fill in as the principle army installation for the "Camino Real" ("Royal Road") venture; the supply base was at Kawich, under the order of Juan del Castillo y ArruÃ©. On 27 July UrsÃºa approved the making of three new state army organizations of 25 men each to strengthen GarcÃ­a. Two were Spanish organizations and one was a blended race organization comprising of mestizos and pardos. 

The SajkabÊ¼chen organization of local musketeers pushed ahead with the street developers from TzuktzokÊ¼ to the first Kejache town at Chunpich, which the Kejache had fled, abandoning a significant measure of nourishment. The organization's officers sent for fortifications from GarcÃ­a at TzuktokÊ¼ however before any could arrive somewhere in the range of 25 Kejache came back to Chunpich with crates to gather their deserted nourishment. The anxious SajkabÊ¼chen guards expected that the occupants were returning as a group and released their guns at them, with the two gatherings at that point withdrawing. The musketeer organization at that point touched base to strengthen their guards and dashed into fight against drawing closer Kejache bowmen. A few musketeers were harmed in the resulting engagement, and the Kejache withdrew along a woodland way without damage, ridiculing the intruders. The SajkabÊ¼chen organization pursued the way and discovered two increasingly left settlements with a lot of relinquished sustenance. They caught the nourishment and withdrew back along the way. 

Around 3 August GarcÃ­a pushed his whole armed force ahead to Chunpich, and by October Spanish officers had built up themselves close to the wellspring of the San Pedro River. By November TzuktokÊ¼ was garrisoned with 86 warriors and more at Chuntuki; in that month GarcÃ­a by and by came back to Campeche. By December 1695 UrsÃºa was experiencing strain to finish the victory of the Itza, and he endorsed the despatch of fortifications along the "Camino Real" to join the fundamental army. The fortifications included 150 Spanish and pardo officers and 100 Maya troopers, together with workers and muleteers. A development gathering of 150 blended Maya and non-Maya warriors got together with GarcÃ­a at Campeche and continued southwards along the "Camino Real" towards the San Pedro River. The remainder of the fortifications did not leave Campeche until March 1696. 

In May 1695 Antonio de Silva had named two gatherings of Franciscans to set out toward PetÃ©n; the principal aggregate was to get together with GarcÃ­a's military undertaking. The second gathering was to set out toward Lake PetÃ©n Itza freely. This second gathering was going by monk AndrÃ©s de AvendaÃ±o. AvendaÃ±o was joined by monk Antonio PÃ©rez de San RomÃ¡n, lay sibling Alonso de Vargas and six Maya Christians selected from MÃ©rida and towns on the way to Campeche. This last gathering left MÃ©rida on 2 June 1695 and advanced toward Juan del Castillo y ArruÃ©'s supply base at Kawich, set up to help GarcÃ­a's military campaign. On 24 June AvendaÃ±o's gathering left Kawich and set off crosswise over an inadequately occupied area. On 29 June they touched base at a deserted Maya sanctuary, which he alluded to by the name Nojku, signifying "Huge Temple". The Spanish had just gone through and had broken many "icons" however the ministers climbed the sanctuary and figured out how to discover around 50 extra formal models, which they decimated; they additionally set a cross inside. The other gathering of monks, on their approach to join GarcÃ­a, went through Nojku a couple of days after the fact and found that neighborhood Maya had officially set new contributions inside. AvendaÃ±o's gathering proceeded with southwards and discovered expanding indications of residence and touched base at the military camp of skipper JosÃ© FernÃ¡ndez de Estenos at the abandoned Maya town of NojtÊ¼ubÊ¼, which had been cleared by the Spanish under GarcÃ­a exactly sixteen years beforehand. 

AvendaÃ±o proceeded with south along the course of the new street, finding expanding proof of Spanish military action, with the gathering together of nearby occupants and striking of fields and plantations for arrangements by Spanish troops. The Franciscans overwhelmed GarcÃ­a at BÊ¼ukÊ¼te, about before TzuktokÊ¼. AvendaÃ±o's gathering touched base at TzuktokÊ¼, close to the Kejache fringe, by 10 July and left two weeks after the fact, around a similar time that GarcÃ­a landed there with his prisoners gathered together at BÊ¼ukÊ¼te for constrained work. Prior to leaving, the Franciscans dissented to GarcÃ­a and his officers about the poor treatment of the neighborhood occupants; the officers guaranteed better treatment of the Maya in future. On 3 August GarcÃ­a progressed to Chunpich however endeavored to induce AvendaÃ±o to remain behind to clergyman to the detainees from BÊ¼ukÊ¼te. AvendaÃ±o rather part his gathering and left stealthily with only four Christian Maya partners, looking for the Chunpich Kejache that had assaulted one of GarcÃ­a's development organizations and had now withdrawn into the backwoods. He was unfit to discover the Kejache yet managed to get data with respect to a way that drove southwards to the Itza kingdom. He met four depleted SajkabÊ¼chen musketeers who were conveying a letter routed to him from chief FernÃ¡ndez de Estenos. This letter clarified that further south there were different betrayed Maya towns with just spoiled maize deserted by their occupiers. AvendaÃ±o came back to TzuktokÊ¼ and rethought his arrangements; the Franciscans were shy of provisions, and the compellingly congregated Maya that they were accused of changing over were vanishing once again into the backwoods day by day. Furthermore, the Spanish officers disregarded the worries of the ministers and GarcÃ­a was snatching nearby Maya ladies and kids to be reclaimed to his "encomienda" for constrained work. The Franciscans set upon an alternate, eventually fruitless, plan; they would pursue the street back north to JopÊ¼elchÊ¼en close Campeche city and endeavor to achieve the Itza through Tipuj. This course was blocked when the mainstream pastorate kept the Franciscans from endeavoring it. Antonio de Silva requested AvendaÃ±o to come back to MÃ©rida, and he touched base there on 17 September 1695. The other gathering of Franciscans, driven by Juan de San Buenaventura ChÃ¡vez, kept after the roadbuilders into Kejache region, through IxBÊ¼am, BÊ¼atkabÊ¼ and Chuntuki (current Chuntunqui close Carmelita, PetÃ©n). 

Juan de San Buenaventura's little gathering of Franciscans had touched base in Chuntuki on 30 August 1695, and found that the military had opened the street southwards for another seventeen alliances (roughly 44.2Â miles or 71.1Â km), practically most of the way to Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡, however came back to Chuntuki because of the regular downpours. San Buenaventura was joined by monk Joseph de JesÃºs MarÃ­a, lay minister TomÃ¡s de Alcoser and lay sibling Lucas de San Francisco. With AvendaÃ±o's arrival to MÃ©rida, commonplace predominant Antonio de Silva despatched two extra monks to join San Buenaventura's gathering: Diego de EchevarrÃ­a and Diego de Salas. One of these was to change over the Kejache in TzuktokÊ¼, and the other was to do likewise at Chuntuki. Albeit at first hesitant to allow the gathering to proceed into Itza domain, by late October GarcÃ­a de Paredes had yielded and submitted to de Silva's directions for San Buenaventura and his unique partners to keep on nojpetÃ©n, despite the fact that it gives the idea this never occurred. On 24 October San Buenaventura kept in touch with the common predominant revealing that the warlike Kejache were presently assuaged and that they had disclosed to him that the Itza were prepared to get the Spanish in fellowship. On that day 62 Kejache men had deliberately come to Chuntuki from PakÊ¼ekÊ¼em, where another 300 Kejache lived. San Buenaventura sent lay sibling Lucas de San Francisco to persuade them to migrate to the Chuntuki mission. Lucas de San Francisco devastated the icons in PakÊ¼ekÊ¼em yet the occupants were not conveyed to the mission in view of stresses over sustaining the fresh debuts. Rather, toward the beginning of November 1695, monk TomÃ¡s de Alcoser and sibling Lucas de San Francisco were sent to build up a mission at PakÊ¼ekÊ¼em, where they were generally welcomed by the cacique and his agnostic cleric. PakÊ¼ekÊ¼em was adequately a long way from the new Spanish street that it was free from military impedance, and the ministers administered the structure of a congregation in what was the biggest mission town in Kejache domain. A second church was worked at BÊ¼atkabÊ¼ to take care of more than 100 KÊ¼ejache outcasts who had been assembled there under the stewardship of monk Diego de EchevarrÃ­a; a further church was built up at TzuktokÊ¼, directed by Diego de Salas. 

Franciscan AndrÃ©s de AvendaÃ±o left MÃ©rida on 13 December 1695, and landed in NojpetÃ©n around 14 January 1696; he pursued the new street beyond what many would consider possible then proceeded towards NojpetÃ©n with nearby Maya guides. He was joined by monks Antonio PÃ©rez de San RomÃ¡n, Joseph de JesÃºs MarÃ­a and Diego de EchevarrÃ­a, and by lay sibling Lucas de San Francisco; a portion of these he gathered on his adventure south along the "Camino Real". On 5 January they got up to speed with and passed the principle unforeseen of the military at BÊ¼atkabÊ¼, proceeding to Chuntuki. From Chuntuki they pursued an Indian trail that drove them past the wellspring of the San Pedro River and crosswise over soak karst slopes to a watering gap by certain remnants, which was recorded as Tanxulukmul by AvendaÃ±o. From Tanxulukmul they pursued the little ActÃ© River to a ChakÊ¼an Itza town called Saklemakal. They touched base at the western end of Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ to an eager welcome by the nearby Itza. 

Obscure to the Franciscans, the northern ChakÊ¼an Itza area of the Itza kingdom was aligned with the Kowoj and was at war with the Itza ruler. The ChakÊ¼an Itzas stole away the vast majority of the endowments that the Spanish party had brought for the Itza lord, with an end goal to prevent neighborly relations creating. The next day, the current Aj Kan EkÊ¼ traversed the lake with eighty kayaks to welcome the guests at the ChakÊ¼an Itza port town of Nich, on the west shore of Lake PetÃ©n Itza. The Franciscans came back to NojpetÃ©n with Kan EkÊ¼ and sanctified through water more than 300 Itza kids over the accompanying four days. AvendaÃ±o endeavored to persuade Kan EkÊ¼ to change over to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish crown, without progress. The Franciscan monk attempted to persuade the Itza lord that the KÊ¼atun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year Maya calendrical cycle starting in 1696 or 1697, was the correct time for the Itza to at long last grasp Christianity and to acknowledge the ruler of Spain as overlord. The lord of the Itza, similar to his ancestor, refered to Itza prediction and said the time was not yet right. He requested that the Spanish return in four months, at which time the Itza would change over and swear fealty to the King of Spain. 

On 19 January AjKowoj, the ruler of the Kowoj, landed at NojpetÃ©n and talked with AvendaÃ±o, contending against the acknowledgment of Christianity and Spanish principle. The talks between AvendaÃ±o, Kan EkÊ¼ and AjKowoj uncovered profound divisions among the Itza â and the obvious unfairness of the Itza lord in offering his kingdom to the Spanish undermined Kan Ek's control over his very own kin. Kan EkÊ¼ scholarly of a plot by the Kowoj and their ChakÊ¼an Itza partners to trap and murder the Franciscans, and the Itza ruler exhorted them to come back to MÃ©rida by means of Tipuj. The Itza ruler's endeavors to spare his Spanish visitors viably finished his capacity to lead; starting there on against Spanish opinion administered Itza reactions to the Spanish. The Franciscans were guided to Yalain where they were generally welcomed however while they were there the Yalain heard gossipy tidbits about fight and a Spanish development towards Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡. The Franciscans were demonstrated a way that prompted Tipuj however their Yalain manages before long surrendered them. The Spanish monks ended up lost and endured extraordinary hardships, including the demise of one of AvendaÃ±o's partners, however following a month meandering in the timberland found their way back to Chuntuki and from that point advanced back to MÃ©rida. 

Kan EkÊ¼ had sent emissaries to MÃ©rida in December 1695 to educate MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa that the Itza would calmly submit to Spanish standard. By mid-January chief GarcÃ­a de Paredes had progressed from BÊ¼atkabÊ¼ to the development part of the "Camino Real" at Chuntuki. At this point he just had 90 warriors in addition to workers and doormen, with a considerable lot of his troopers betraying as the power progressed towards Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡; they were additionally deferred by the need of structure a paddle fueled longboat (or "piragua") to cross the San Pedro River. Not long after AvendaÃ±o's flight eastbound from NojpetÃ©n, a gathering of 60 Maya warriors entered Chuntuki in full warpaint and bearing weapons; they professed to have been sent by AvendaÃ±o to gather religious formal attire and another monk. This was not the situation, and they were very likely an exploring party sent by the Kowoj and their ChakÊ¼an Itza partners to perceive what advance the Spanish armed force was making along the street. They talked with GarcÃ­a and afterward quickly left without taking any of the things that they had as far as anyone knows been sent to gather. GarcÃ­a despatched two Kejache scouts to the lakeshore to find AvendaÃ±o's whereabouts; in the meantime AvendaÃ±o's Kejache guides were coming back to Chuntuki from NojpetÃ©n with updates on AvendaÃ±o's flight. The Itzas at the lake gave over an open letter composed by AvendaÃ±o before his takeoff from NojpetÃ©n as a token of companionship between the Itza and the Spanish. Monk Juan de San Buenaventura was enthused by the letter and wished to head out on to NojpetÃ©n himself. 

GarcÃ­a sent chief Pedro de Zubiaur, his senior officer, on towards the lake. He touched base at Lake PetÃ©n Itza with 60 musketeers, minister San Buenaventura and another Franciscan and partnered Yucatec Maya warriors. They were likewise joined by around 40 Maya doormen. On 2 February the endeavor was drawn nearer by two Itza warriors who let them know of an ongoing fight between a Guatemalan undertaking and the Itza; these two Itzas guided the gathering to an adjacent Itza settlement, and the letter from AvendaÃ±o was appeared to skipper Zubiaur, persuading him that he could progress securely. The port town of ChÊ¼ichÊ¼ was surrendered however countless drew nearer, made a decision to be upwards of 300 by the Spanish skipper, bearing maybe 2,000 Itza warriors. The warriors started to blend uninhibitedly with the Spanish party and started to stack the Spanish supplies into the kayaks with a guarantee of transporting the campaign crosswise over to NojpetÃ©n, with one trooper in each kayak. The Franciscans promptly boarded the kayaks, with two officers as an escort. A fight at that point broke out; twelve a greater amount of the Spanish party were constrained into kayaks, and two watchmen were pounded the life out of. One of the caught Spanish warriors was quickly beheaded. Now the Spanish warriors opened flame with their black powder rifles, and the Itza withdrew over the lake with their detainees. 

The Spanish party withdrew from the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were encompassed by around 2,000 Itza warriors who endeavored to incapacitate them; the Itzas figured out how to catch another Spaniard and quickly struck off his head. Now around 10,000 Itza toxophilite showed up from kayaks disguised among the lakeside mangroves, and Zubiaur requested his men to flame a volley that slaughtered somewhere in the range of 30 and 40 Itzas. Understanding that they were miserably dwarfed, the Spanish withdrew towards Chuntuki, surrendering their caught partners to their destiny. A Christian Maya musketeer and six different Indians fled toward the beginning of the fight and took news to GarcÃ­a that the whole undertaking had been butchered; Zubiaur and the overcomers of his campaign walked once more into the base camp at Chuntuki two days after the fact. UrsÃºa later announced that the Spanish detainees were reclaimed to NojpetÃ©n where they were altogether murdered; this was additionally affirmed by AjChan sometime in the not too distant future. The bones of the dead were said to have been found by the Spanish after the last attack on NojpetÃ©n in 1697; AjKÊ¼in Kan EkÊ¼, the Itza devout cleric, later revealed that he had bound San Buenaventura and his buddy into cross shapes and cut out their souls. 

This unforeseen development persuaded MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa that Kan EkÊ¼ would not surrender calmly, and he started to arrange a full scale strike on NojpetÃ©n. The enrollment of recently approved fortifications was presently dire, yet was upset when 70 of 100 officers mutinied and never achieved GarcÃ­a's camp. Work out and about was intensified and about a month after the fight at ChÊ¼ichÊ¼ the Spanish touched base at the lakeshore, presently bolstered by mounted guns. Again an extensive number of kayaks assembled, and the anxious Spanish troopers opened flame with guns and guns; no setbacks were accounted for among the Itza, who withdrew and raised a white banner from a sheltered separation. 

The Guatemalan specialists were uninformed of progressing contacts between the frontier experts in YucatÃ¡n and the Itza. In the second 50% of 1695 President Barrios started arranging another undertaking against the Itza from Verapaz, following brutal analysis of Juan DÃ­az de Velasco's retreat from close Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ in April of that year. Barrios kicked the bucket in November, and "oidor" JosÃ© de Escals wound up acting leader of the Guatemalan pilgrim organization. He designated "oidor" BartolomÃ© de AmÃ©squeta to lead the following undertaking against the Itza. AmÃ©squeta walked his men through heavy downpour from CahabÃ³n to MopÃ¡n, touching base on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were as yet unconscious of the conflicts between GarcÃ­a's powers and the Itza. AmÃ©squeta's campaign was experiencing deficiencies of local work and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were wiped out, and his development slowed down as the power rested up at MopÃ¡n. Skipper DÃ­az de Velasco volunteered to lead a gathering of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was joined by Dominican monks CristÃ³bal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was likewise joined by AjKÊ¼ixaw, the Itza aristocrat who had been taken prisoner on DÃ­az's past campaign, who filled in as a confided in guide, scout and interpreter. They set out from MopÃ¡n on 7 March and left some wiped out fighters with certain provisions following five days, they at that point made up for lost time with a development gathering of roadbuilders and their military escort at RÃ­o Chakal. The two powers consolidated, giving DÃ­az a power of 49 warriors and 34 watchmen and bowmen from Verapaz. When they touched base at IxBÊ¼ol, close to the shore of Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡, AjKÊ¼ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to NojpetÃ©n. 

Back in MopÃ¡n, AmÃ©squeta had gotten extra supplies and chosen to make up for lost time with his development party. He left MopÃ¡n on 10 March 1696 with monk AgustÃ­n Cano and around 10 fighters. He touched base at Chakal seven days after the fact yet there was still no word from DÃ­az or AjKÊ¼ixaw. On 20 March AmÃ©squeta left Chakal with 36 men and four days' provisions to discover DÃ­az's gathering, whom he expected would be adjacent. Following two days going in extreme warmth they got together with some Verapaz doormen that DÃ­az had deserted. They pursued DÃ­az's trail to the shore of Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ close to the Itza capital. As they explored along the south shore they were shadowed by around 30 Itza kayaks, and more Itzas drawn closer via land yet kept a sheltered separation. There were ample signs that DÃ­az's gathering had passed that way, and AmÃ©squeta expected that they had crossed to NojpetÃ©n. He composed a letter to DÃ­az, which was passed to an Itza passerby who showed he would convey it. Different Itzas now moved toward the gathering, including an aristocrat who traded endowments with AmÃ©squeta. Amid different endeavors at correspondence to check DÃ­az's whereabouts the Itza ended up disturbed and reacted furiously, albeit nobody in the Spanish party could comprehend the Itza language. The Itzas showed that the Spanish ought to continue to the lakeshore along a tight way and leave in the little kayaks that were positioned adjacent. One of AmÃ©squeta's officers perceived an Indian among the Itzas as a Mopan who had filled in as a fighter in DÃ­az's first undertaking and imagined that the Mopan was attempting to let him know not to confide in the Itzas. 

AmÃ©squeta was incredibly suspicious of the little kayaks being provided, realizing that the Itza had 30-man kayaks; he was likewise mindful that deceiving foes into little kayaks was a favored strategy among the marsh Maya to separate and murder Spanish gatecrashers. He presumed that AjKÊ¼ixaw had sold out them and this was correctly what had happened to DÃ­az and his men. As sunset drew closer, low on proportions, in a helpless area and with no indication of DÃ­az and his men, AmÃ©squeta withdrew from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a little slope adjacent. In the early hours of the morning he requested a retreat by evening glow, utilizing only a couple of lights. They touched base back at Chakal on 25 March and from that point withdrew to San Pedro MÃ¡rtir on 9 April, assailed by exacerbating conditions, a tropical storm, affliction and gossipy tidbits about foes. The battered campaign set up a base camp nine groups (around 23.4Â miles or 37.7Â km) north of Mopan. 

Composing after the fall of NojpetÃ©n, monk Cano depicted a definitive destiny of DÃ­az de Velasco and his sidekicks; he professed to have gotten the data from meetings with the troopers from YucatÃ¡n who had raged the Itza capital and from ChÊ¼ol witnesses, despite the fact that there were no ChÊ¼ol at NojpetÃ©n. DÃ­az's gathering touched base at the lakeshore and were told by neighborhood Itza that Franciscan ministers were at NojpetÃ©n. They were vigilant at first and requested confirmation, whereupon an Itza delivery person presented to them a rosary as a token. Looking over the lake they saw men dressed as ministers calling to them to go over, these were Itza wearing the propensities for the two Franciscans who had as of late been executed at the island. DÃ­az and his associates at that point loaded up the Itza kayaks, leaving thirty Maya doormen with their donkeys and supplies. 

Once on the lake the Itza toppled a portion of the kayaks and slaughtered a portion of DÃ­az's men; others were injured and hauled aground to be executed. DÃ­az, the Dominicans and two other men were in a vast kayak that was not toppled and were taken to NojpetÃ©n where a wild battle followed as DÃ­az endeavored to protect himself with his sword, murdering a few Itzas. The two other men were promptly slaughtered while the monks were pulsated and attached to X-molded crosses before having their hearts removed. Over the lake, the Itza assaulted the watchmen guarding the endeavor supplies and murdered every one of them. The Itza murdered a sum of 87 undertaking individuals, including 50 troopers, two Dominicans and around 35 Maya partners. The remaining parts of the little gathering that were executed on NojpetÃ©n were later recovered by the Spanish after the fall of the city and were reclaimed to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala for entombment. 

Over the next weeks investigates were sent to attempt to reach nearby Mopan and ChÊ¼ol people group, including Chok Ajaw, AjMay, IxBÊ¼ol and Manche without progress â a large portion of the locals had fled, leaving the timberland betrayed. At San Pedro MÃ¡rtir he got updates on AjChan's consulate to MÃ©rida in December 1695 and the formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish specialist. Unfit to accommodate the news with the loss of his men at Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡, and with horrifying conditions in San Pedro MÃ¡rtir, AmÃ©squeta surrendered the incomplete fortification. Minister Cano prescribed to the new Guatemalan president that the ChÊ¼ol be moved to Verapaz where they could be appropriately regulated. Because of the fizzled endeavor, Cano's suggestion was acknowledged, the stronghold was destroyed and any Maya that could be caught over a wide swathe of southern PetÃ©n was persuasively migrated to BelÃ©n close Rabinal in Verapaz. This movement was merciless and heartless and was censured by a few high-positioning pilgrim authorities, including "oidor" JosÃ© de Escals and even by AmÃ©squeta. 

The Itzas' proceeded with obstruction had turned into a noteworthy shame for the Spanish pilgrim specialists, and warriors were despatched from Campeche to take NojpetÃ©n for the last time. The last ambush was made conceivable by the steady opening of the street from MÃ©rida to PetÃ©n; by December 1696 this street had achieved the lake shore in spite of the fact that it was incomplete and still practically blocked in spots. At this point the profound divisions between the political pioneers of the Itza were with the end goal that a brought together guard of the Itza kingdom had turned out to be unimaginable. 

In late December 1696 the ChakÊ¼an Itza assaulted the huge Kejache mission town of PakÊ¼ekÊ¼em; they stole practically every one of the occupants and consumed the congregation. The crippled Spanish army at Chuntuki covered their weapons and ammo and withdrew five classes (around 13Â miles or 21Â km) back towards Campeche. From late December 1696 to the center of January 1697 UrsÃºa sent gatherings of fighters and laborers along the street towards the lake; the primary gathering was directed by Pedro de Zubiaur and had guidelines to start constructing a "galeota", a substantial paddle fueled warship. This gathering was trailed by fortifications bringing supplies, including light and overwhelming weapons, black powder and sustenance. On 23 January UrsÃºa left Campeche with more troopers and muleteers, bringing the all out number of officers touching base as fortifications to 130. The Spanish braced their situations at ChÊ¼ichÊ¼ and conveyed substantial big guns for its safeguard. 

MartÃ­n de UrzÃºa y Arizmendi touched base on the western shore of lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ with his officers on 26 February 1697, and once there constructed the intensely furnished "galeota" assault vessel, which was gathered at ChÊ¼ichÊ¼ over a space of 12 days toward the beginning of March. The "galeota" had a bottom of 30 cubits or ; it had 12 paddles on each side and a rudder with an iron screw. The "galeota" conveyed 114 men and no less than five ordnance pieces, including a "pieza" (light gun) and four "pedreros" (mortars). The "piragua" longboat used to cross the San Pedro River was likewise transported to the lake to be utilized in the assault on the Itza capital; this vessel had 6 paddles and a rudder. 

From 28 February onwards the Spanish undertaking was more than once drawn nearer by threatening Itzas, who now and then shot bolts toward the interlopers yet incurred no losses. In the meantime, little gatherings of inquisitive Itzas blended uninhibitedly with the Spanish and got knickknacks from them, for example, belts, pieces of jewelry and hoops. 

On 10 March, Itza and Yalain emissaries landed at ChÊ¼ichÊ¼ to consult with UrsÃºa. First came AjChan who had just met him in MÃ©rida; he was trailed by Chamach Xulu, the leader of the Yalain. Kan EkÊ¼ then sent a kayak with a white banner raised bearing emissaries, including the Itza consecrated cleric, who offered tranquil surrender. UrsÃºa got the consulate in harmony and welcomed Kan EkÊ¼ to visit his place to stay three days after the fact. On the selected day Kan EkÊ¼ neglected to touch base; rather Maya warriors massed both along the shore and in kayaks upon the lake. 

UrsÃºa chose that any further endeavors at tranquil fuse of the Itza into the Spanish Empire were silly, and a waterbourne strike was propelled upon Kan Ek's capital on the morning of 13 March. The settlement at ChÊ¼ichÊ¼ was left shielded by 25 Spanish fighters, three Maya musketeers and a few big guns pieces. UrsÃºa boarded the "galeota" with 108 warriors, two common ministers, five individual workers, the sanctified through water Itza emissary AjChan and his brother by marriage and an Itza detainee from NojpetÃ©n. The assault pontoon was paddled east from ChÊ¼ichÊ¼ towards the Itza capital; most of the way over the lake it experienced a huge armada of kayaks spread in a circular segment over the way to deal with NojpetÃ©n, covering about starting with one shore then onto the next â UrsÃºa essentially gave the request to push through them. Countless had assembled along the shore of NojpetÃ©n and on the tops of the city. As the "galeota" drew nearer, more kayaks put out from the shore and the Spanish were encompassed. When they had encompassed the "galeota", Itza bowmen started to shoot at the trespassers. UrsÃºa offered requests to his men not to flame but rather bolts injured a few warriors; one of the injured troopers released his black powder gun and by then the officers lost control of their men. The guarding Itza before long fled from the shriveling Spanish gunfire. 

The city fell after a brief yet wicked fight in which numerous Itza warriors kicked the bucket; the Spanish endured just minor losses. The Spanish siege caused overwhelming death toll on the island; the enduring Itza relinquished their capital and swam crosswise over to the terrain with many biting the dust in the water. After the fight the enduring safeguards softened away into the backwoods, leaving the Spanish to involve a relinquished Maya town. MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa planted his standard upon the most elevated purpose of the island and renamed NojpetÃ©n as "Nuestra SeÃ±ora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza" ("Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza"). The Itza respectability fled, scattering to Maya settlements all through PetÃ©n; accordingly the Spanish scoured the area with inquiry parties. Kan EkÊ¼ was before long caught with assistance from the Yalain Maya ruler Chamach Xulu; The Kowoj lord (Aj Kowoj) was additionally before long caught, together with other Maya nobles and their families. With the thrashing of the Itza, the last free and unconquered local kingdom in the Americas tumbled to the European colonizers. 

MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa had little enthusiasm for controlling the recently vanquished region and assigned its control to military officers who he did almost no to help, either militarily or monetarily. With NojpetÃ©n securely in the hands of the Spanish, UrsÃºa came back to MÃ©rida, leaving Kan EkÊ¼ and other high-positioning individuals from his family as detainees of the Spanish battalion at Nuestra SeÃ±ora de los Remedios y San Pablo, confined among the antagonistic Itza and Kowoj who still overwhelmed the territory. The battalion was fortified in 1699 by a military campaign from Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, joined by blended race "ladino" regular citizens who came to establish their very own town around the military camp. The pioneers carried infection with them, which murdered numerous troopers and homesteaders and cleared through the indigenous populace. The Guatemalans remained only three months before coming back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, taking the hostage Itza ruler with them, together with his child and two of his cousins. The cousins kicked the bucket on the long adventure to Santiago; Ajaw Kan EkÊ¼ and his child spent the remainder of their lives under house capture in the pilgrim capital. 

At the point when the Spanish vanquished the PetÃ©n lakes in 1697, the Yalain were at first agreeable and aided the catch of the lord of the Itza. Right now Yalain was managed by Chamach Xulu. The Yalain authority energized Christian transformation as a methods for keeping up harmony with the involving Spanish powers. As time went on, Yalain participation with the Spanish seems to have diminished. Not long after the triumph, the Yalain fled their settlements to abstain from searching Spanish gatherings that were snatching Maya ladies for "administration" at their sleeping quarters. Right now, such was the threatening vibe that was felt towards the possessing powers that the occupants of the Yalain settlements wanted to consume their fields and break all their earthenware instead of leave anything for the Spanish. The Yalain capital is recorded as having been scorched in 1698. 

In the late seventeenth century, the little populace of ChÊ¼ol Maya in southern PetÃ©n and Belize was persuasively evacuated to Alta Verapaz, where the general population were ingested into the QÊ¼eqchiÊ¼ populace. After the triumph, the provincial organization of PetÃ©n was partitioned between the clerical experts in YucatÃ¡n and mainstream organization as a major aspect of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. There was never a solid Spanish nearness in the zone, which stayed remote, in spite of the fact that the Spanish manufactured a stronghold jail, the Castillo de Arismendi; it was done in 1700. 

The separation from Nuestra SeÃ±ora de los Remedios y San Pablo (once in the past NojpetÃ©n) to MÃ©rida, joined with the troublesome territory and the threatening vibe of the locals prompted the street from YucatÃ¡n falling into a condition of dilapidation. In 1701 UrsÃºa y Arezmendi understood that the street was in such a poor express, that the Spanish battalion couldn't be provided from YucatÃ¡n. He kept in touch with the King of Spain, mentioning that PetÃ©n be exchanged from the purview of YucatÃ¡n to the "Audiencia Real" of Guatemala. In 1703 UrsÃºa's request was in truth, with the condition that the clerical specialist over PetÃ©n would go to the Dominican Order. 

Somewhere in the range of 1703 and 1753, "reducciones" were set up at San JosÃ© and San AndrÃ©s on Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡, Santa Ana only south of the lake, and at San Luis, Santo Toribio and Dolores in the south (not to be mistaken for Dolores del Lakandon). Every one of these mission towns had its very own pastor who offered an explanation to the "vicario general" with the Spanish battalion at Nuestra SeÃ±ora de los Remedios y San Pablo. In the principal many years of the eighteenth century, houses of worship were worked in five provincial towns: Dolores, Remedios, San AndrÃ©s, San JosÃ© and Santo Toribio. The congregation in Dolores was worked in 1708; the development was likely administered by Juan Antonio Ruiz y Bustamante. In 1699 there were nine clerics in PetÃ©n however from that point there was normally a lack of ministry in pilgrim PetÃ©n. Notwithstanding the protests of the Dominicans who had been working in southern PetÃ©n, the Franciscans kept on giving ministry from YucatÃ¡n, and it was the Franciscans who directed the profound welfare of PetÃ©n amid the frontier time frame. 

AjTut was one of the rulers of the northern ChakÊ¼an Itza territory of the vanquished Itza kingdom; minister AvendaÃ±o had met him amid his endeavor to NojpetÃ©n. After the success he moved from the north shore of Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ to Mompana, an area lying between Lake Yaxha and the Classic time frame vestiges of Tikal. For certain years after the victory he built up the Mompana area as an asylum from the Spanish and occupied with internecine war against the enduring Kowoj toward the south. 

At the season of the fall of NojpetÃ©n, there are assessed to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡, including countless from different regions. It is evaluated that 88% of them kicked the bucket amid the initial ten years of provincial principle inferable from a mix of infection and war. In spite of the fact that infection was in charge of most of passings, Spanish campaigns and internecine fighting between indigenous gatherings likewise had their influence. 

Catholic ministers from YucatÃ¡n established a few mission towns around Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ in 1702â 1703. The main towns to be moved into pilgrim "reducciones" were Ixtutz, which turned into the new town of San JosÃ©, and neighboring San AndrÃ©s, both on the north shore of Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡. They were first oppressed by one of UrsÃºa's officers, Cristobal de Sologaistoa, before being passed into the consideration of the Dominican ministers for the Christian change of the occupants. Enduring Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new frontier towns by a blend of influence and power. Kowoj and Itza pioneers in these mission towns defied their Spanish overlords in 1704 and nearly retook NojpetÃ©n, yet albeit very much arranged, the resistance was immediately squashed. Its pioneers were executed, and the majority of the mission towns were deserted; by 1708 just around 6,000 Maya stayed in focal PetÃ©n. The decreases flopped in huge part in light of the fact that the evangelists accused of changing over the occupants couldn't talk the Itza language. 

MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa utilized his success of the Itza as a venturing stone to accomplishing the pined for post of Governor-General of the Philippines, which he took up in 1709. European-presented infections crushed the local populace of PetÃ©n, with the impacts of illness intensified by the mental effect of annihilation. The populace around Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ numbered somewhere in the range of 20,000 and 40,000 out of 1697. By 1714, a registration recorded a little more than 3,000 people in Spanish PetÃ©n, including non-Indians. This number would not have incorporated the supposed "wild" Maya living in the woodland a long way from Spanish organization and control. By 1700 the new provincial capital of PetÃ©n was fundamentally possessed by homesteaders, officers and convicts. Amid the second 50% of the eighteenth century, grown-up male Indians were intensely exhausted, frequently being constrained into obligation peonage. Western PetÃ©n and neighboring Chiapas remained scantily populated, and the Maya occupants evaded contact with the Spanish. 

San JosÃ©, on the northwest shore of lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡, is the home of the last enduring speakers of the Itza language. The surname Kowoj still endures, however the Kowoj and Itza have completely combined and never again exist as discrete ethnicities. In present day times there is a past filled with struggle between San JosÃ© (the previous Itza town of ChakokÊ¼ot) and neighboring San AndrÃ©s (the previous Kowoj-unified town of ChakÊ¼an), and this shared antagonistic vibe most likely speaks to antiquated threatening vibe between the Itza and the Kowoj. 

HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s portrayed his campaign to Honduras in the fifth letter of his "", in which he subtleties his intersection of what is presently Guatemala's PetÃ©n Department. Bernal DÃ­az del Castillo went with CortÃ©s on the endeavor to Honduras. He composed a long record of the victory of Mexico and neighboring districts, the "Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva EspaÃ±a" ("True History of the Conquest of New Spain"). His record was done around 1568, exactly 40 years after the crusades it portrays; it incorporates his very own depiction of the campaign. In 1688 pioneer student of history Diego LÃ³pez de Cogolludo point by point the campaigns of the Spanish preachers BartolomÃ© de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita in 1618 and 1619 in his "Los trÃ©s siglos de la dominaciÃ³n espaÃ±ola en YucatÃ¡n o ocean historia de esta provincia" ("The three centuries of Spanish control in YucatÃ¡n, or the historical backdrop of this area"); he put together it with respect to Fuensalida's report, which is currently lost. 

Franciscan minister AndrÃ©s AvendaÃ±o y Loyola recorded his very own record of his late seventeenth century voyages to NojpetÃ©n, written in 1696 and entitled "RelaciÃ³n de las entradas que hize a la conversiÃ³n de los gentiles Ytzaex" ("Account of the undertakings that I made to change over the Itza barbarians"). At the point when the Spanish at long last vanquished PetÃ©n in 1697 they created an immense amount of documentation. Juan de Villagutierre Soto-Mayor was a Spanish provincial authority who originally held the post of relator of the Royal Chancery of Vallodalid and later as that of the Council of the Indies. All things considered he approached the extensive measure of provincial reports put away in the General Archive of the Indies. From these he delivered his "Historia de la Conquista de la Provincia de el Itza, reduccion, y progressos de la de el Lacandon, y otras naciones de indios barbaros, de la mediacion de el Reyno de Guatimala, a las provincias del Yucatan en la AmÃ©rica Septentrional" ("History of the Conquest of the Province of the Itza, decrease, and advances in that of the Lakandon, and different countries of primitive indians, and the intercession of the Kingdom of Guatemala, and the areas of Yucatan in Northern America"). This was first distributed in Madrid in 1701 and definite the historical backdrop of PetÃ©n from 1525 through to 1699. 

UrsÃºa alluded toward the western port town of ChÊ¼ichÊ¼ as "Nich". The cutting edge name for a point on the south side of the cove is Punta NijtÃºn, which is most likely gotten from the frontier Yucatec "nix tun", which means stone incline. Archeologists completed unearthings at the lake shore at Punta NijtÃºn and found a stone incline there, which was most likely worked by UrsÃºa's troops to dispatch his "galeota".
