Houtteman was marked by the Detroit Tigers late in 1944 and started to rehearse with the Tigers in spring preparing before the 1945 season alongside individual Detroit sandlot player Billy Pierce. He burned through the majority of the 1945 season playing for Detroit's top small time offshoot, the Buffalo Bisons. Yet, wounds tormented the Tigers' pitching staff, and the 17-year-old Houtteman was called up by the parent club and started his real alliance vocation. 

Because of Tiger pitching wounds, and with many top players still in the military late in World War II (Houtteman was unreasonably youthful for the draft), he made his real class debut on April 29. At 17Â years old, he was the most youthful player in the American League in the 1945 season before being optioned back to Buffalo, where on June 20 he tossed seven no-hit innings, confronting just 22 hitters all the while, however lost the amusement 2â 0 in additional innings.

He was consigned to the warm up area for a period, and saw little activity. Be that as it may, after Hal Newhouser, Fred Hutchinson and Dizzy Trout were utilized in two days, Tiger supervisor Steve O'Neill chose to begin Houtteman against the Washington Senators for just the second beginning of his vocation. He hurled a five-hit shutout and Tiger general chief Billy Evans stated, "In 40Â years I've never observed a superior pitching work by a first-year pitcher. We presently realize that Houtteman is extremely a major leaguer". He pursued this with another five-hit triumph against the Boston Red Sox, at that point contributed a three-hit shutout September against the St. Louis Browns. He completed the season at 7â 2 with a 3.42 ERA, seven complete diversions and two shutouts. His execution in 1947 grabbed the eye of New York Yankees star and future Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio, who said of Houtteman and Bob Lemon, "They have more stuff and more pitching sense than some other youthful colleagues I've seen come up in a drawn-out period of time". 

The 1948 Detroit Tigers season started with Houtteman in the beginning turn. Things began off inadequately, be that as it may, as Houtteman lost his initial eight choices. Two of the initial five misfortunes, however, were by one run, and he had little run help. The 0â 8 begin and absence of run bolster prompted his being classified "Hard Luck Houtteman" in the media. His first triumph that year came against the Senators, in which he likewise drove in the triumphant run. In the wake of winning his next begin, he vanquished the Philadelphia Athletics permitting just five hits, and maintained a strategic distance from another misfortune. However, he at that point lost eight additional amusements and completed the season at 2â 16. His colleagues and the media ascribed this to misfortune instead of terrible pitching, and still viewed him as a prime prospect. Newhouser stated, "The child has had only misfortune since the season opened", while Fred Hutchinson stated, "He shouldn't have lost more than three or four diversions had he gotten an even break". Be that as it may, his 4.66 ERA was just 0.06 higher than the significant class normal. 

As 1949 spring preparing started, Houtteman was about slaughtered. In Lakeland, Florida on March 10, while driving home from Florida Southern College, he collided with an organic product truck breaking his skull. Initially recorded in basic condition (a cleric remained by to control the last ceremonies in extremis), he recuperated quickly and had the capacity to converse with his colleagues two days after the mishap, letting them know, "I'll have the capacity to pitch sooner than you". Inside about fourteen days, the Tigers were hopeful that Houtteman would almost certainly play again by June. Because of the wounds to Houtteman and Yankee star catcher Yogi Berra because of auto collisions, Cleveland Indians playing administrator Lou Boudreau restricted his players from driving, constraining the prospective title holders to ride contracted transports to display recreations.

As the 1950 Detroit Tigers season began, Houtteman was on a high note, pitching all of spring preparing without permitting a walk. He won his tenth round of the period on June 28, 1950, and turned into the principal pitcher to hit the 10-win mark close by Bob Lemon. After the amusement, he told an Associated Press columnist that he was just about persuaded that Lady Luck had chosen to offer him a reprieve in the wake of kicking him around for as long as a few years. Houtteman stated, "I've been having a quite decent year and it beyond any doubt feels great after a portion of the things that have transpired". Seven days into July, Houtteman scored his eleventh triumph, and just lost five amusements, in a 6â 1 success against the St. Louis Browns. Only a couple of days after the fact, Houtteman was named to the All-Star list close by individual Tigers including Ted Gray, George Kell and Hoot Evers.

Prior to the beginning of the 1951 season, Houtteman was drafted into the United States Army. He had initially been grouped 4F, or restoratively ineligible for the draft, due to a secondary school knee damage, and he felt that he was drafted simply because he was an unmistakable competitor. He served in the overwhelming weapons division of the Army, where the thunder of the serious canons sent torments throbbing through Houtteman's head and gave him extreme migraines, which specialists accepted was a waiting impact of the skull crack three years sooner. Accordingly, the Army renamed Houtteman as not completely fit the bill for battle obligation. This prompted a medicinal release on September 15, 1951. Talking about his time in the Army, Houtteman stated, "I invested the vast majority of my energy in the Army medical clinic. I played a little ball at Camp Pickett", Virginia. 

When he came back to the Tigers for spring preparing in 1952, Tigers' director Red Rolfe noted, "Artie could be our best pitcher. He's the droop breaking type, a person who can toss a shutout on occasion". After a poor season without Houtteman in 1951, Rolfe anticipated, "We'll be back in the principal division this season since Art Houtteman is back. Houtteman makes us somewhere around twelve recreations superior to [last year's Tigers' team]". Houtteman worked out in Detroit with pitcher Ted Gray over the winter before the 1952 season. Before the season began, Houtteman stated, "Everything relies upon how I get off. I'm on edge to get into the season. My arm doesn't feel any not quite the same as it did in '50. I trust I can show improvement over my last year".

In an April 26 matchup against the Cleveland Indians, with two outs in the base of the ninth, Houtteman was one out far from a no-hitter when he tossed a fastball that "should sink" however did not, which Harry hit for a solitary. Houtteman stated, "This was the main pitch I shook Ginsberg off the entire diversion", and for quite a long time a short time later, catcher Joe Ginsberg over and again said to Houtteman, "On the off chance that you'd tuned in to me, I'd have you in the Hall of Fame". Detroit won by a score of 13â 0. In the wake of losing his tenth amusement on June 22, administrator Red Rolfe moved Houtteman out of the beginning turn and into the warm up area.

This denoted the finish of his vocation as a Tiger. 

On June 15, 1953, Houtteman was exchanged by the Tigers, alongside Owen Friend, Joe Ginsberg and Bill Wight, to the Cleveland Indians for Ray Boone, Al Aber, Steve Gromek and Dick Weik.

He stated, "The fans are down on me and I'd do everyone significantly progressively great by being exchanged". He was not content with the Tigers and said there were times when it appeared he "couldn't hold on to strip off his uniform after a diversion". Because of Indians' pitching mentor Mel Harder completing a "total" upgrade, Houtteman was moved into the beginning pivot, to supplant Bob Feller. Houtteman completed the season in Cleveland with a 7â 7 record, six complete amusements, one shutout, 109 innings pitched, and a 3.80 ERA. 

Toward the beginning of the 1954 Cleveland Indians season, Houtteman's second girl, Hollis Ann, was conceived on February 22. His pitching kept on improving under Mel Harder, who "got me to stop testing and to look for my common conveyance". The Indians utilized him when they could, particularly in additional inning issues.

As per sportswriter Hal Lebovitz, this was a consequence of the beginning five for the Indians, including spot starter Feller, pitching great amid spring preparing. Houtteman was again raised in exchange bits of gossip, alongside Mike Garcia, since the Indians were stacked with pitching ability. At the point when director Al LÃ³pez was supplanted by Kerby Farrell, Houtteman did, actually, land in Farrell's doghouse. Farrell got him out front of his partners after a poor exhibition in spring preparing. Houtteman contributed just four innings three amusements for the Indians in 1957. 

Houtteman was put on the exchange alliance before the 1957 season, however he drew no genuine offers since Cleveland appeared to be frantic to exchange him. On May 20, subsequent to playing three recreations for the Indians, Houtteman was sold to the Baltimore Orioles for an undisclosed sum. Hal Lebovitz called Houtteman "a pitcher of significant guarantee however who by one way or another still can't seem to take advantage of it", in spite of the way that he was in his twelfth and last real class season.
