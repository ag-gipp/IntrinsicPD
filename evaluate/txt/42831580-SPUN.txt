To ensure the Danubian fringe among Romania and Bulgaria, the flotilla set up a shielded base in the Belene Canal. At the point when the Romanians entered the war on 27 August 1916, the screens were again at Rustschuk, having been joined by "Temes" after her fixes were finished. The screens were quickly assaulted by three extemporized torpedo vessels working out of the Romanian stream port of Giurgiu. The torpedoes that were terminated missed the screens, however hit a lighter stacked with fuel. The first Monitor Division, including "Temes", was entrusted with escorting supply dispatches back to the Belene safe haven.

The Danube Flotilla at that point secured Austro-Hungarian troops pulling back towards Budapest, battling French and unpredictable Serbian powers as they pulled back, and touched base on 6 November. 

After the Armistice of Villa Giusti marked by the Austro-Hungarians on 3 November 1918, "Bosna" was worked by the naval force of the Hungarian People's Republic between 6 November and 13 December. She was then maintained by mariners of the recently made Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) in 1918â 19.

Throughout the following three days, the two screens laid mines in the Danube close to the Romanian outskirt. 

On 11 April, the two screens were compelled to pull back from Dubovac towards Belgrade, amid which they went under rehashed assaults by Junkers Ju 87 "Stuka" plunge planes. "Vardar" and her individual screen were whole, and tied down at the conjunction of the Danube and Sava close Belgrade about 20:00, where they were joined by the screen . The three chiefs presented, and chose to abandon their vessels because of the high water levels in the waterways and low scaffolds, which implied there was inadequate leeway for the screens to explore unreservedly. The teams of the screens were transshipped to two tugboats, yet when one of the tugboats was going under a railroad connect, charges on the extension incidentally detonated and the scaffold fell onto the tugboat. Of the 110 officers and men on board the vessel, 95 were murdered.
