Quick to fill in as a military pilot, Barr at first attempted to enroll in the Royal Air Force, however pulled back his application when informed that it was impossible he would fly whenever sooner rather than later, and that he could anticipate just regulatory obligations in the meantime. 

Coming back to Australia on the RMS "Strathaird", Barr joined the Royal Australian Air Force as an air cadet on 4Â March 1940. In the wake of experiencing guidance on Tiger Moths at No.Â 3 Elementary Flying Training School, Essendon, and on Hawker Demons and Avro Ansons at No.Â 1 Service Flying Training School, Point Cook, he was authorized as a pilot officer on 24Â September. He picked up a notoriety for being something of a dissident amid preparing, and turned out to be everlastingly known as "Nicky", for "Old Nick", or the Devil. In his mission to pick up task as a military pilot, he had purposely pointed inadequately amid besieging practice, a stratagem additionally embraced by somewhere around two of his kindred understudies. By November 1940, he had been presented on No.Â 23 (City of Brisbane) Squadron, flying CAC Wirraways on watch off the Queensland coast. The air ship was, as indicated by Barr, "our cutting edge contender back then, yet it didn't take too long to even consider realizing that the limit of the Wirraway, contrasted and the kinds of planes that we were going to experience, failed to impress anyone".

Bobby Gibbes progressed toward becoming No.Â 3 Squadron's boss in February 1942, and made Barr his senior flight administrator. Elevated to flight lieutenant on 1Â April, Barr was raised to acting squadron pioneer and selected to direction the unit in May, scarcely a half year after he initiated activities, following Gibbes' hospitalization with a broken lower leg.
