Ali Shadman is one of only a handful couple of Kurdish individuals staying in Baghdad. His family are battling monetarily and resort to siphoning petroleum from their vehicle to run their back-up generator when the power framework falls flat. At the point when the generator separates one night, Ali starts to ask why he is fixing it against a background of gunfire, rather than considering in harmony. One more night, he reports the area's news however discloses there is nothing to discuss other than the typical blasts, savagery, and passing. Anmar Refat, a Syriac Christian, endeavors to stay philosophical and trusts that equipped packs won't assault the school. His family, be that as it may, are increasingly anxious about any adjacent gunfire, as their Christian convictions increment the risk to their lives if anybody somehow happened to get some answers concerning them. Anmar has a sweetheart, whom he can contact just by means of his cell phone, yet he has not gotten notification from her in a few days, abandoning him stressed over whether she has discovered another beau, or has been harmed in the brutality. Hayder Khalid, a Shia Muslim, wants to turn into a well known artist lyricist. He every now and again downloads music recordings of English-language popular music so he can learn mainstream English tunes and move moves. Mohammad Raed, a Sunni Muslim, is the class comedian at school, who favors playing sports and wasting time with his companions to considering. Uninformed of his conduct at school, his mom trusts he is dedicated, independent and develop, and trusts he will graduate and go to college. 

Part of the way through the school year, Ali's family moves to the more tranquil Kurdish district in Northern Iraq yet in the wake of living there for a while, Ali says that he is pining to go home and misses the activity and commotion of Baghdad. Mohammad, feeling desolate, "receives" a flying creature with a broken wing and a mouse he finds in the house. This presents to him some solace, yet his mom later requests that he dispose of the mouse as she doesn't need "vermin" in the house. Mohammad's family cheer when Saddam Hussein is condemned, and feel that his later execution was advocated, as to do generally would have made the Iraqi individuals look feeble. Then again, Anmar's family is irritated with his execution, as they feel that the general population who came into power were no superior to anything Hussein was. Hyder's mom says that numerous Iraqi individuals were confident about the landing of American powers, and that it isn't right to censure America for the majority of the issues in Iraq. She noticed that the gore still can't seem to stop as the Sunni keeps on murdering the Shiite, and the other way around. As the film proceeds, Hyder's family loses its salary and they begin to pitch their furnishings to gain additional cash. 

Toward the year's end, the young men must pass seven end of the year tests to graduate. Anmar, Hyder and Ali each come up short two subjects, and are given the choice to retake the tests. Anmar passes the retakes and tries to examine English writing in school, and his family choose to move to the more secure area of Arbul since he has graduated. Hyder likewise retakes his tests and passes, however his family can never again bear to pay for the college expenses. Ali decides not to retake the tests, and his family leave Iraq.

"The Boys from Baghdad High" was co-delivered and co-coordinated by Ivan O'Mahoney and Laura Winter. Prior to taking a shot at the movie, O'Mahoney had been a United Nations peacekeeper in Bosnia and a lawyer in the Netherlands, and had coordinated the 2006 narrative "How to Plan a Revolution", which profiled two youthful activists who endeavored to expel the Azerbaijani government from power by organizing an "Orange" unrest. He had additionally worked for the BBC, Channel 4, CNN, and PBS in Ethiopia, Iraq, Sudan and Colombia. Winter had recently worked for CNN, "an hour", "CBS Evening News", CBS Radio, "The Christian Science Monitor" and the New York "Day by day News" in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Jordan and Iraq. "The Boys from Baghdad High" was the first occasion when she was credited as an executive. 

O'Mahoney and Winter started chipping away at the film in 2006. Winter had watched a film called "The Women's Story", around two Iraqi ladies who had traveled around the nation and recorded what they saw. They needed to make a narrative about "the general population never observed on the nightly news, [instead of] presidents, executives, commanders and aggressors ... professing to know something of Iraq's future". Winter clarified that "every one of these documentaries leaving Iraq were accomplished for or by grown-ups. Iraqi youngsters had not been in excess of an UN measurement about the dead, grabbed or harmed", so they chose to focus on what they saw as the "genuine wellspring of Iraq's future" â adolescents. "I needed to recount to the account of Iraq in an unexpected way. As writers, we do anecdotes about children and young people, however we don't get notification from them. In the event that you go to the UN reports, they are only a number and that is it." O'Mahoney was somewhat more hesitant; he had as of late worked in Iraq yet did not wish to return because of the common war and the decaying state of the nation. When it was chosen to utilize a school as a scenery to the story, which could likewise be utilized to give a sequential account, O'Mahoney and Winter acknowledged it would be unreasonably risky for the understudies to be seen with either a Western or Iraqi camera group since it would attract an excess of regard for them, thus they chose that the understudies would film the narrative themselves. 

Makers picked young men who were understudies of Tariq receptacle Ziad High School. The school was clutching the thought of a unified Iraq, even as the nation was ending up progressively racially and religiously isolated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter realized that the Baghdad locale Karrada was blended and incorporated with high quantities of Shiites and Christians. She asked her previous driver and interpreter, who had gone to the school, in the event that he would contact the main. At first the school was suspicious of their goals, yet chose to confide in the judgment of Winter's interpreter. Central Ra'ad Jawad chose eight young men to participate in the narrative since he realized they could be cautious about making the narrative, would not get exhausted, and would stay focused on recording their lives for a year. The makers needed their cast to incorporate young ladies, and had discovered a school and families willing to partake in the narrative, however the then-Minister of Education would not give them a chance to participate. Jawad went to London to meet the makers and he was prepared to work the camcorders that the young men were to utilize. The cameras and tapes were sent into Iraq through the BBC News division, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi partner makers prepared the young men how to utilize the cameras. Two months into taping, four of the young men dropped out of the task, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter never met the young men while the narrative was being delivered in light of the fact that it was such a high-chance task. 

The makers were constant in guaranteeing the young men's security. O'Mahoney clarified: "They were under exceptionally severe security rules when they were recording. They were advised not to go about as news cameramen. They were not permitted to film in the road. They could just film at school or at home, in secure conditions." Winter included, "they are not paid news cameramen, and that was not the purpose of the film. Would they typically be running down the road toward a firefight to film it? No. Would they keep running toward a shelling, realizing that there could be an auxiliary blast or a gathering of troopers, who could begin, at any second, discharging uncontrollably into the group, to film a bit of video? No. That is not genuine for any Iraqi non military personnel." Nevertheless, Hayder at times recorded outside around evening time, and disclosed to the camera that he must be watchful in light of the fact that individuals are victimized in the event that they are seen conveying even a cell phone. On New Year's Eve, he and his companion celebrate with a campfire in his companion's back yard, however subsequent to discussing whether a clamor they hear is firecrackers or gunfire, Hayder surges home. Another kid is headed to class one morning, and achieve a unique powers roadside checkpoint en route. He clarifies, "on the off chance that they see me with a camera they will take me to jail; they'll believe I'm a fear monger who needs to bomb them." 

Over 300 hours of film was recorded by the understudies and the two Iraqi partner makers. It was deciphered, made an interpretation of and altered into an hour and a half film. Getting the tapes out of Iraq demonstrated troublesome for Winter and O'Mahoney, who stayed in the UK. They needed to depend on columnists from numerous news offices, particularly those in the BBC News' Baghdad Bureau high-chance group, to pirate the tapes out of Iraq. At the point when curfews were upheld, weeks go before the makers got new film since it was unthinkable for anyone to leave their homes or the nation. 

The execution of Saddam Hussein, which Anwar had recorded from the web through and through, was rejected from the narrative. "We had a major discussion about whether that ought to go into the film", O'Connor clarified. Water proceeded, "it was a unique little something where to see it, it just gets you. Be that as it may, we needed to ask ourselves, does it help our story? No." Footage that was almost altered out incorporated a scene where Anwar needed to siphon oil out of the family vehicle for the house's generator. Anwar disclosed to the camera that he expected to do it in light of the fact that their family was so poor. "That is intense", remarked Water, "since that is a disrespect to his family." 

"The Boys from Baghdad High" got its reality premiÃ¨re at the 2007 Sheffield Doc/Fest, a yearly film celebration for narrative creations held in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. In the US it was screened on 29 April 2008 at the Tribeca Film Festival, and 1 August 2008 at the Traverse City Film Festival. The first run through Winter and O'Mahoney met one of the film's subjects was at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, about a year after the shooting had finished. Ali and his family had moved to the US since finishing the narrative, thus he had the capacity to go to the screening. Winter and Ali met a second time at the Traverse City Film Festival. The makers had endeavored to get the young men visas to enter the UK for a screening in London, however they were denied section by the British Government.

The narrative was spilled online by the BBC utilizing its BBC iPlayer administration to UK inhabitants for seven days after the underlying communicate. A Region 2 DVD of the narrative can be acquired, in spite of the fact that it must be obtained straightforwardly from the BBC and isn't accessible in stores. 

Audits for "The Boys from Baghdad High" were commonly ideal. "The Huffington Post" said that giving the camcorders to the understudies was a fantastic thought in light of the fact that the portrayal of their school-life versus the expanding peril was caught "with impartial equity [so] that the film can catch the interiority of its subjects more intensely than a straight-forward examination of savagery would". Thomas Sutcliffe of "The Independent" stated, "its storyline was represented not by a tick-rundown of stock account quandaries and privileged insights however the pitiless vulnerabilities that occupation and insurrection have conveyed to Baghdad." "Time Out New York" gave the film five out of five stars, and PopMatters evaluated it 8 out of 10. "The Washington Post"s Paul Farhi stated, "HBO has cut a specialty as the TV home of probably the most convincing projects about the Iraq war ... "Baghdad High" does no damage to HBO's thriving war cred[ibility]." "Assortment", "The Christian Science Monitor", "LA Weekly", and the "Los Angeles Times" likewise lauded the film. At the Question-and-Answer session following a screening at the Tribeca Film Festival, one crowd part, a newcomer to the United States Marine Corps, told Ali, who had additionally visited, "I at long last recognize what life resembles behind those dividers and what you folks resemble, and it's been outrageously phenomenal." 

There were objections, notwithstanding, that the narrative did not sufficiently delineate of the political parts of the Iraqi War. Farhi stated, "The hour and a half narrative doesn't say much regarding the bigger issues confronting Iraq, yet it captures some little and enthralling human stories... They happen to live in what one kid portrays as 'the most perilous city on Earth.' You don't see a lot of Iraq's viciousness in "Baghdad High", yet you definitely feel its gravity and their fear." The "Boston Herald"s Mark Perigard said that he felt the narrative was "an individual story, not a political one". In "The New York Times", Mike Hale remarked, "While the young men talk as often as possible about viciousness and misery, they seldom examine legislative issues or ethnic contrasts (except for Anmar, the Christian) and they never legitimately address the American nearness. We do hear some parental feelings, which are shockingly nonpartisan. One mother says: 'We shouldn't censure the Americans for everything. There is some kind of problem with us as well'." Jennifer Marin, a culture feature writer from the "Los Angeles Times", composed at About.com, that while it was creative, useful and a respectable test, the recording is "undistinguished and unpleasant on the grounds that the hands holding the cameras weren't gifted and the eyes encircling the shots were not those of specialists or sharp eyewitnesses." She felt that, except for Mohammad, the young men needed allure, and that the movie neglected to catch the show of living in a battle area, because of the absence of an executive making major decisions. Perigard stated, "After the time you've contributed [as a viewer], it's not about fulfilling enough. For every one of the inquiries this interesting film raises, it should be written in sand." 

Numerous analysts noticed the similitudes between the Iraqi young men and those from Western societies. Dwindle Scarlet, the creative executive at the Tribeca Film Festival, stated, "What's captivating about the film that came about is the manner by which recognizable and standard these children are â they're not by any stretch of the imagination all that unique in relation to your very own young people or the messes with you went to class with. The children of Baghdad High additionally open us up to an altogether different feeling of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on the evening news for a long time." "The Huffington Post" stated, "beforehand it had been incredible that understudies in Baghdad may encounter a similar fleeting and narcissistic awfulness as we are in the United States." Farhi and Nicholls saw that the Iraqi understudies do indistinguishable things from American secondary school understudies, for example, tuning in to rap music, endeavoring to think about without diversions, playing sports, getting to be worried over their last tests of the year and acting senseless with their companions. Perigard remarked, "in spite of the social contrasts, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will appear to be in a split second natural to any individual who has invested energy around an adolescent kid. They like to wrestle one another, adoration Western music, think beyond practical boundaries and experience difficulty locking in school." 

The "New York" magazine said that the film's reason of four secondary school companions recording their senior year "sounds like a feathery unscripted TV drama"; Bill Weber of "Inclination Magazine" stated, "putting the preliminaries of MTV unscripted TV drama divas in context, the white collar class group of four will be relatable to this BBC/HBO creation's crowd in their simple grasp of Western child stuff ... Executives Ivan O'Mahoney and Laura Winter balance [portray] an ordinary feeling of the teenagers' wartime uneasiness with the more typical adolescent alleviation." Similarly, "The Huffington Post" raised examinations with MTV unscripted TV dramas, however was satisfied to see that the Iraqi young men did not play to the cameras since they had not been presented to projects, for example, "" or "The Paper". That adolescent help was remarked on by many; "The Washington Post" featured Mohammad's appropriation of an unwelcome mouse in the house. Sound portrayed a scene where Mohammad and Ali act like prisoner and captor. "All of a sudden Ali is holding a substantial blade. 'He's being underhanded!' Mohammad says. Ali holds the blade close Mohammad and says, excessively dispassionately: 'Allah! This is the principal prisoner. I'm going to butcher him along these lines.' Mohammad instructs him to quit playing around. Ali yields. 'O.K. He just got a presidential acquittal. He can live'." Reuters additionally remarked on this, and more talk among Ali and Mohammad. "Ali is indicated making an imagine prisoner video with Mohammad, and afterward prodding his companion for his rotten feet. 'On the off chance that Chemical Ali truly needed to decimate the north he ought to have terminated a rocket with Mohammad's socks in it'." 

The delineation of the distinct contrasts among Iraq and the Western world additionally gotten remarks. Farhi portrayed the school as having "all the appeal of a surrendered jail", and proceeded with, "visiting a companion who carries on a couple of hundred yards away includes running a potential gauntlet of hijackers and expert riflemen; getting the chance to class on time implies exploring military checkpoints. Prior to a major test, educators search their understudies for explosives," while Perigard stated, "during the evening, their neighborhoods are filled with gunfire and blasts". In the New York "Day by day News", Patrick Huguenin expressed, "American teenagers wouldn't perceive different scenes demonstrating how life slips into an intensely managed arrangement of checkpoints and curfews." Hale stated, "The way the young men can tell without looking whether it's an Apache or a Chinook helicopter overhead, the manner in which the window ornaments are constantly drawn, the dimension of physical contact and fondness among the men ... would be strange to American sensibilities." 

"The Boys from Baghdad High" was generally welcomed from its underlying screening. It was assigned for a Youth Jury Award at the 2007 Sheffield Doc/Fest, shortlisted for an Amnesty International 2008 UK Media Award in the classification for Television Documentary and Docudramas, and the European Independent Film Festival named it the Best News and Current Affairs film. It was named for the Readers' Award in the "Radio Times", and in May 2008 it won the Premiere Prize at the Sandford St. Martin Trust Awards, which recognizes perfection in religious telecom. The Trust's executive and previous BBC Head of Religious Broadcasting Colin Morris said of the narrative, "We saw the manner in which confidence breaks into mainstream life in the turmoil of present-day Iraq. Originating from various ethnic and religious foundations the young men demonstrated that notwithstanding the war their every day distractions were much equivalent to those of adolescent young men the world over â lady friends, guardians, sport, design, tests, music. Would their fellowship endure? At last the program defied British watchers with the inquiry: 'What in God's name would we say we are doing there? The film got an overwhelming applause from the gathering of people at the Traverse City Film Festival, and at the Tribeca Film Festival it was short-recorded for the 2008 World Documentary Feature Competition, contending with eleven other true to life films for Best Documentary Film and Best New Documentary Filmmaker.
