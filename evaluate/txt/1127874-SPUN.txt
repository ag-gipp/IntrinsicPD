She continued chronicle in 2000 at Sing Studios in Australia, where she shot her job for the 2002 film "Ruler of the Damned" amid the day and recorded melodies around evening time. Through her chronicle contract with Blackground, the artist worked basically with the record name's in-house team of scholars and makers, including Bud'da, J. Name, Rapture, and Eric Seats, just as long-term colleague Timbaland. 

"Aaliyah" is a R&B and neo soul record whose music draws from funk, hip bounce, elective shake, and electronica, among different styles. The makers consolidated synthesizer tunes, divided beats, mutilated guitar, and whimsically controlled vocals and melody structures. Quite a bit of "Aaliyah" managed the complexities of sentimental love and distinctive stages in a relationship. The majority of the tunes were composed by lyricist Static Major, who shared a dear companionship and solid affinity with Aaliyah. She saw the collection as an impression of herself as both a youthful grown-up and a developed vocalist.

After her passing, offers of the collection soar and pushed it to number one on the "Announcement" 200. "Aaliyah" was discharged amid a time of pinnacle movement in contemporary R&B and, since its underlying gathering, has been refered to by faultfinders as a standout amongst the best R&B records of now is the right time. 

Aaliyah discharged her second collection "One out of a Million" in 1996, and moved on from secondary school the next year. She increased further introduction with hit tunes from film soundtracks, including her 1998 single "Would you say you are That Somebody?". After it turned into the greatest hit of her profession by then, Aaliyah needed to keep a lower profile and stay away from overexposure. A subsequent record was made arrangements for February 1999, however she deferred its account to build up an acting vocation, which prompted a featuring job in the 2000 film "Romeo Must Die". The film uplifted her profile fundamentally, while the soundtrack's single "Attempt Again" turned into her first number-one tune on the pop graphs. Her mark Blackground Records utilized the film and its soundtrack to set up a dissemination manage Virgin Records America, which would convey Blackground's resulting discharges all inclusive, including her self-titled third collection. 

Aaliyah started recording the collection in 1998. She recorded a couple of melodies, incorporating two with long-lasting teammate Timbaland, before dealing with "Romeo Must Die". In 1999, while chipping away at the record in New York City, Aaliyah called and asked Trent Reznor, one of her melodic symbols, to deliver a tune, however they couldn't facilitate their calendars. She expected to complete the collection before the finish of 2000 and continued its account while taping in Australia for "Ruler of the Damned" (2002), as she shot her part for the film amid the day and recorded melodies around evening time. She said in a meeting for "Announcement", "there were evenings when I went poorly the studioâI was excessively worn out. On the ends of the week, I constantly made it." Jomo Hankerson, Blackground president and Aaliyah's cousin, said that he needed to "reward the makers", who did not have any desire to "go most of the way around the globe!" He included that they eventually had "a delightful timeÂ ... making hot music". 

The majority of the collection's tunes were recorded at either Sony Studios in New York City or Sing Studios in Melbourne, including "Free Rap", which was done at the two studios.

Aaliyah worked with Blackground Records' in-house group of artists, musicians, and makers, including tenderfoot makers Bud'da, J. Name, Rapture, and Eric Seats. Music supervisor Jimmy Henchman, a companion of Aaliyah's director Barry Hankerson, helped organize the record's generation and orchestrated the makers and authors to work with the vocalist. 

A large portion of the collection's verses were composed by Static, from the R&B band Playa. While the band was developing separated, he was welcomed by Blackground to be a lead essayist for the collection subsequent to expressing "Are You That Somebody?" and "Attempt Again". Static was a piece of Aaliyah's nearby gathering of companions, which included Missy Elliott and Timbaland, and imparted a captivation to her. He observed Aaliyah to be perfect for his songwriting style, while she trusted that he could precisely depict her emotions. A quietly sexual lyricist, he expressed "Raise some static" for her in 1999, yet Blackground felt she was not prepared for the melody. Barry Hankerson said of his songwriting, "We generally were defensive over each lyricÂ ... Be that as it may, he did things where you never felt affronted. You just felt like you caught somebody thinkingÂ ... he was cleverÂ ... Aaliyah relied upon him [and] he relied upon her." Elliott said that he was "a piece of that extension of Aaliyah growing up melodiously". While she examined the verses with Static, the artist counseled Bud'da about the sound and melodic course of the collection. She was keen on finding out about the UK carport scene at the time. 

In March 2001, Aaliyah wrapped up the collection in the wake of having taped her part in "Ruler of the Damned" for four months, which eventually deferred the collection's discharge. In Australia, she likewise completed a photograph shoot for "Aaliyah" with picture takers Jeff Dunas, Jonathan Mannion, David LaChapelle, and Albert Watson. The artist dealt with five pythons at the shoot and built up a liking for snakes, discovering them "hazardous, however very lovely" and delegate of her on the collection. She returned to the snake subject in her music video for "We Need a Resolution" in April and told MTV, "They live in isolation, [and] there are times throughout my life [when] I simply need to be without anyone else's input. There are times I can't make sense of myself. I feel they are exceptionally unpredictable animals, [but] in the meantime, they're provocative, as well. That is the reason they speak to "Aaliyah" entirely well." She portrayed the record as "a great impression of [myself] and the individual [I am] today", saying in a meeting for "Stream" magazine, "I am a youthful grown-up now, and I think this collection demonstrates my development vocally." "Aaliyah" was aced by Bernie Grundman at his studio in Los Angeles. 

A R&B and neo soul collection, "Aaliyah" highlights midtempo funk tunes, hip bounce finished uptempo tracks, and moderate sticks that drew on more established soul impacts. Alongside contemporary urban sounds, its music fuses Middle-Eastern impacts, quieted elective shake, andâespecially on Timbaland's tunes for the collectionâLatin timbres. "Never No More" blends both more seasoned soul and present day hip bounce sounds with string courses of action by maker Bud'da, while "Read Between the Lines" is a musical, advanced samba with Latin percussion. "Aaliyah"s generation highlights synthesizer tunes, vintage syndrums, contorted guitar, staccato courses of action, and layered, capriciously controlled vocals. John Mulvey of "NME" discovered its sound unobtrusive and lacking "grandiloquence and drama", while the magazine's Alex Needham compared its "powerful", high recurrence generation to name reggae and the dim, open move music of Dr. Dre and Massive Attack. In Stephen Thomas Erlewine's assessment, the collection was particular from the more seasoned soul leanings of Macy Gray and Jill Scott, as its music sounds unusual yet current, "turning out a skillet social exhibit of sounds, styles, and feelings". 

"Aaliyah"s beats were delivered in a way that made them sound divided, displaying techno and electro surfaces. Tracks, for example, "Free Rap", "Additional Smooth", and "Consider the possibility that" highlight offbeat melody structures exploring different avenues regarding goals. "I Can Be" and "Imagine a scenario where" fuse 2-step and shake components, despite the fact that the last tune draws especially from Detroit techno and modern shake. On the club-affected "In excess of a Woman", Aaliyah sang over cruel sounding synthesizer and guitar sounds, while "Free Rap" highlights submerged commotions, serene electronica in the style of the Neptunes, and agreeably delicate vocals proclaiming "it ain't simply cadence and blues". Ernest Hardy of "Moving Stone" contrasted the collection's experimentation with the sounds on OutKast's "Stankonia" (2000), Sade's "Darlings Rock" (2000), and Missy Elliott's "Miss E... So Addictive" (2001). As indicated by "Inclination Magazine"s Sal Cinquemani, "similar to Elliott's type bowing "So Addictive", "Aaliyah" gives a missing connection between hip-jump and electronica." 

The verses on "Aaliyah" investigate the complexities of sentimental love and stages in a relationship, for example, anguish, trivial captivation, and issues close to the finish of a relationship. Inconspicuous, happy diversion and clever audio effects, for example, amusing vocal control mix the topics of tragedy and sensuality. As indicated by Citysearch's Justin Hartung, the record "changes the disarray of youthful adulthood into thrilling opportunity", while "Billboard"s Rashaun Hall said every melody had a remarkable passionate character that go with the music's sonic assortment. Sway Waliszewski of "Connected" watched female strengthening themed tunes that demonstrate a "solid dignity" by Aaliyah, who "doesn't endure unfaithful miscreants ('You Got Nerve'), mind diversions ('I Refuse'), self-awed hunks ('Extra Smooth'), tattle and jealousy ('Loose Rap'), or physical maltreatment ('Never No More')". The key-moving, drum and bass-affected "Additional Smooth" addresses an energetic romance and is motivated by a discussion among Aaliyah and Static about how men endeavor to act smooth, while "Free Rap" is titled after the slang expression of a similar name and rejects sentimental admirers who go through trite pick lines. "Those Were the Days" impartially rejects a male darling, while "Consider the possibility that" irately compromises an unfaithful sweetheart and by expansion comparable men. On "I Care 4 U", the storyteller endeavors to support a companion who is shattered, yet ends up upset by lonely emotions she has for him. 

Aaliyah's vocals are in a controlled soprano style all through the collection. "Vibe" magazine's Hyun Kim contended that its melodies attract center to her singing more than her past records, "conveying it to the bleeding edge instead of concealing it behind the layered creation". "Raise some static" was sung with short of breath vocals by Aaliyah, who educates her darling on the most proficient method to satisfy her explicitly and likens her suggestive high to a medication high. Anthems, for example, "I Care 4 U", "Never No More", and "I Refuse" are sung all the more emotively, communicating despairing characteristics and hurt. On "I Can Be", Aaliyah sings from the point of view of a two-faced man's courtesan who needs to be his preeminent sweetheart. Alex Macpherson from "The Guardian" composed that "Aaliyah's clear, desensitized conveyance" on the tune "makes being the other lady appear to be a candidly masochistic type of self-medicine". Biographer Christopher John Farley said she "sincerely nitty gritty a melody" not at all like on her past collections and that "her delicate voice currently appeared to be something basic, a generously wind blowing through the parts of a major tree." According to Joshua Clover, Aaliyah drives melodic notes "into weird corners of syncopation's tricky design" on the more "shape-challenging" tracks. He composed that "she makes the sonics recount to the story, making significance outside the verses, delight past the snares."

In spite of the fact that it was the most elevated deals seven day stretch of Aaliyah's profession, the collection at first sold slower than her past record, "One out of a Million".

"We Need a Resolution" had been discharged as the lead single on April 13, however did not get huge radio airplay and just achieved number fifty-nine on the "Board" Hot 100.
