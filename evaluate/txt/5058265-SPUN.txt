Experiencing childhood in eastern Sydney, Windle was prepared by Frank Guthrie from the age of 12. Windle's first significant swimming challenge was the 1960 Australian Championships. Matured 15, his second-place complete in the 1650Â yd free-form earned him a spot in the group for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Be that as it may, the Australian mentors just took him along to pick up involvement and he didn't contend. He won his first national title in 1961âthe 1650Â yd free-formâand guaranteed the 220â 440â 1650Â yd treble in 1962. Windle made his universal introduction at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, winning gold in the 4Â ÃÂ 220Â yd free-form and silver and bronze in the 1650 and 440Â yd free-form individually. In 1963, he won four individual national titles, adding the 880Â yd occasion to the fruitful resistance of his three titles. He won three individual titles in 1964 and continued to the Tokyo Olympics where he was killed in the warms of the 400Â m free-form in the wake of endeavoring to spare vitality for the last. Accordingly, Windle adopted a forceful strategy in the 1500Â m and set Olympic records in the warms and last to win gold. He included a bronze in the 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m free-form transfer. 

After the Olympics, Windle enlisted at Indiana University, where he prepared under Doc Counsilman. While in the United States, Windle changed over to run swimming. He contended in the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica, winning the 440Â yd free-form, 4Â ÃÂ 110Â yd and 4Â ÃÂ 220Â yd free-form transfers, all in world-record times. He contended in his second Olympics in Mexico City in 1968, hustling the 100Â m and 200Â m free-form and the relating transfers, having finished his progress to dashing. He won a bronze and silver in the particular transfers and resigned after the amusements. In retirement, he worked for Allis-Chalmers in the United States, before being exchanged to their Australian division. 

Conceived in Sydney on 7 November 1944, Windle experienced childhood in the eastern Sydney suburb of Waverley. Windle and his sister Norma figured out how to swim at adjacent Bronte Beach. His family later moved to Bexley North, and he swam for his school group at Marist College Kogarah. Windle was instructed by Frank Guthrie at the Enfield pool from the age of 12. After a fortnight of preparing, he entered the locale age aggregate titles and won a spot in the main three. From that point on, he started preparing three or four times each week, and his dad drove him to Enfield for morning preparing. By the age of 15, he was preparing each day. 

A defining moment for Windle was the 1960 Australian Championships; he came next in the 1650Â yd free-form behind John Konrads and was chosen for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. He dropped out of secondary school to go to a three-month preparing camp in Queensland with the Olympic swimming group. Windle did not swim in Rome; group authorities just needed him to gain from the daily schedule and air of Olympic swimming. On his arrival to Australia, he changed to the tutelage of Don Talbot, who likewise trained Konrads. 

Talbot nicknamed Windle "the greyhound" as a result of his slight and precise form. Because of Windle's little form, he took somewhere in the range of 45 and 47 strokes to finish a lap, yet individual separation swimmer Murray Rose required just 35 to 37 strokes. Talbot said that Windle was the most daintily assembled tip top swimmer that he had prepared, and had extraordinary inconvenience in attempting to build Windle's casing. Talbot spurred Windle and ingrained him with a more prominent dimension of self conviction. As far as it matters for him, Windle reacted by expanding his outstanding task at hand, and was viewed as Talbot's most tireless understudy. Windle prepared with an assurance that regularly observed him swim through other people who were in his preparation path. These impacts prompted objections by recreational swimmers that Windle was excessively forceful. He regularly did twice as much pre-season preparing as different swimmers in Talbot's squad. As indicated by Talbot, Windle's shortcoming was that he was just fit for swimming in two different ways, level out or in all respects gradually. Windle experienced difficulty in pacing himself to monitor vitality for later occasions. Talbot mourned to "never [being] sufficiently adroit to understand that he [Windle] didn't have the nuances of pace that would have added to his combat hardware as a swimmer". 

At the 1961 Australian Championships, Windle won the 1500Â m in a period of 17Â min 37.7Â s to guarantee his first Australian title at 16 years old. Be that as it may, his triumph was dominated when his bathers somewhat tumbled off amid the race. In the next year, Windle demonstrated his adaptability by winning the 220Â yd, 440Â yd and 1650Â yd free-form occasions, in the midst of 2Â min 2.9Â s, 4Â min 25.0Â s and 17Â min 53.3Â s separately. He additionally tied down the New South Wales group to triumph in the 4Â ÃÂ 220Â yd free-form transfer. Chosen for the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, he denoted his worldwide introduction with silver and bronze in the 1650Â yd and 440Â yd free-form separately. Murray Rose, who had come back from rivalry in the United States school framework, won the two occasions. Rose won the 1650Â yd occasion, completing in 17Â min 18.1Â s, with Windle 26.4Â s financially past due. In the 440Â yd occasion, Rose completed in a period of 4Â min 20.0Â s, 3.1Â s in front of the third-set Windle. Windle likewise won gold in the 4Â ÃÂ 220Â yd free-form hand-off, alongside Rose, Allan Wood and Anthony Strahan, setting a world record all the while. 

With Rose missing in the United States, Windle won the 220Â yd, 440Â yd, 880Â yd and 1650Â yd free-form at the 1963 Australian Championships, during 2Â min 2.8Â s, 4Â min 23.0Â s, 9Â min 10.5Â s and 17Â min 59.6Â s separately. His journey to clear the majority of the free-form occasions fizzled when David Dickson crushed him in a touch complete in the 110Â yd race. The pair were neck and neck yet Dickson made a decision about the completing touch on the divider better. Windle gathered two additional successes as a major aspect of the New South Wales group in the 4Â ÃÂ 220Â yd and the 4Â ÃÂ 110Â yd free-form transfers, tying down the two groups of four. 

Windle set world records in the 200Â m and 220Â yd free-form in 1963, posting times of 2Â min 0.3Â s and 2Â min 1.1Â s separately. He won three individual titles at the 1964 Australian Championships, the 200Â m, 400Â m and 1500Â m free-form in the midst of 2Â min 0.0Â s, 4Â min 17.6Â s and 17Â min 9.4Â s separately. As it was an Olympic year, the challenge was held over measurement separations, in conformance with Olympic norms. Windle was an individual from every one of the three New South Wales hand-off groups as they cleared the transfer occasions, winning the 400Â m and 800Â m free-form and 400Â m mixture transfers. 

Windle's exhibitions qualified him for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, where he was slated to swim four occasions: the 400Â m and 1500Â m free-form and the 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m and 4Â ÃÂ 200Â m free-form transfers. Windle's first occasion was the 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m free-form transfer, where he joined with Dickson, Peter Doak, and John Ryan to win Australia's warmth in a period of 3Â min 40.6Â s, which falled behind the United States' triumphant warmth time by 1.8Â s. Windle tied down the group as Australia originated from second at the midpoint to win their warmth. The Australians were the second quickest qualifier for the finals. Notwithstanding, the United States improved their time by a further 5.6Â s in the last, however Australia could just improve their opportunity to 3Â min 39.1Â s, abandoning them third the Americans and Germans. Australia were in second spot for the initial two legs, until Germany moved into the silver decoration position at the last change by 0.1Â s. A separation swimmer, Windle couldn't stay aware of his German anchorman partner, and Australia fell 1.9Â s behind the silver medalists before the finish of the race. 

In the 400Â m free-form warms, Windle and Talbot made a misjudgement; trying to moderate his vitality for the last they chose that Windle ought not go level out, and Windle was four seconds slower than he was at the Australian Championships. Windle was one of the top seeds for the race, and Talbot exhorted him to swim hard in the main portion of the race before backing off. Be that as it may, he swam too gradually and missed the last totally. In spite of the fact that he won his warmth by seven seconds in a period of 4Â min 21.6Â s, he was the ninth quickest by and large, so he missed the last by one position with a period deficiency of 0.5Â s. The slowest qualifier was Tsuyoshi Yamanaka, who had been kept from pulling back from the race by his mentors. Then again, the two other Australian agents who he vanquished at the national titles made the last, including Wood, who proceeded to win bronze. Talbot said that the strategic mistake was generally his obligation and that he took in a great deal from it. 

In the 1500Â m, Talbot chose that Windle would assault from the start and endeavor to hold tight in the last phases of the race. They additionally chipped away at Windle's system, relieving his propensity for dropping his elbow to a lower position when he was worn out. Windle broke the Olympic record in the warms with a period of 17Â min 15.9Â s to qualify quickest for the last by over six seconds. In the last, Windle rehashed the methodology of dashing from the begin, driving all through to bring down his very own Olympic record to 17Â min 1.7Â s and holding off American John Nelson by 1.3Â s. Windle's strategies disturbed the raceplan of the Americans; Nelson and world record holder Roy Saari had intended to pace each other all through the race, however wound up responding to Windle as opposed to swimming their own race. Subsequently, Saari completed in seventh spot, far outside his worldwide standard. 

Windle later joined with Wood, Ryan and Dickson in the 4Â ÃÂ 200Â m free-form hand-off last. Having rested their two individual medalistsâWood and Windleâin the warms, Australia attempted to fourth place and were the slowest qualifier for the last. In the decider, Australia were fourth when Windle made a plunge for the grapple leg, 3.7Â s behind the third-put Japan. Windle posted a period of 1Â min 58.7Â s, the 6th quickest split in the race and the quickest Australian leg by 3.0Â s. In spite of the fact that he made up 1.8Â s on the Japanese stay swimmer, it was insufficient and Australia completed fourth, 1.9Â s out of the awards. 

After the Olympics, Windle selected at Indiana Universityâwhose Indiana Hoosiers swimming group was trained by Doc Counsilmanâon an athletic grant. He did as such subsequent to getting guidance from Australian partner, Olympic gold medallist and Indiana understudy Kevin Berry. He considered business while going after the college, where he changed his concentration to shorter dash separations. Windle did not appreciate as much accomplishment at short-course swimming in the United States as he did in long-course swimming. He refered to the absence of delight for changing to shorter separations, joking "Why swim 30 laps for a gold, when you can get one for swimming two laps?" However, Windle making the most of his time in the United States, supporting of the extra accentuation on transfers and solidarity and the public activity that it involved. Windle additionally delighted in gaining from Counsilman, who was viewed as a specialist in mechanics, bringing about an improvement in his swimming strategy. 

Windle's exhibitions in the United States for Indiana earned him choice for the 1966 Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica. He won the 440Â yd free-form in a world record time of 4Â min 15.0Â s, however with his attention now on the shorter separations, just overseen fourth in the 1650Â yd free-form with a period of 17Â min 49.2Â s, 4% slower than his own best for the separation. He won golds in the 4Â ÃÂ 110Â yd free-form hand-off with Ryan, Dickson and Michael Wenden and the 4Â ÃÂ 220Â yd free-form with Wenden, Dickson and Peter Reynolds. The seasons of 3Â min 35.6Â s and 7Â min 59.5Â s, separately, were world records. 

In 1967, Windle resigned, however made a rebound to contend in the shorter separations in the wake of being convinced by Talbot. In 1968, Windle moored Indiana's 880Â yd free-form transfer to triumph at the National Collegiate Athletic Association Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, fixing what might be the first of six successive men's group titles for the college. He at that point contended in the Australian Championships without precedent for a long time. In spite of the fact that he didn't win any individual occasions, he was a piece of New South Wales' triumphant groups of four in the 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m and 4Â ÃÂ 200Â m free-form transfers. Windle was delegated the skipper of the men's Olympic swimming group, picking up choice for the 100Â m and 200Â m free-form occasions and the separate free-form transfers. He was not chosen for the 1500Â m free-form, finishing the barrier of his Olympic title before the group had achieved Mexico City. 

In the 100Â m free-form, Windle came next in his warmth in a period of 54.8Â s, making him the 6th quickest qualifier for the elimination rounds. He improved his opportunity to 54.6Â s in the elimination rounds, however this put him just eleventh and he missed the last by 0.5Â s. In the 200Â m free-form, Windle came next in his warmth behind Wenden and scratched into the last by 0.3Â s as the seventh quickest qualifier. He improved his time by 0.1Â s in the last to complete 6th in 2Â min 0.9Â s. Wenden won the two occasions. After the 200Â m last, Wenden lost cognizance because of weariness and sank submerged. Wenden was pulled from the water and spared after Windle saw the episode. 

In the 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m free-form, Windle joined with Wenden, Robert Cusack and Greg Rogers to win bronze behind the United States and the Soviet Union. Australia utilized a similar group and swimming request in both the warms and finals, with Windle doing the third leg. Australia came next in their warmth behind the United States and qualified third generally speaking, and the Soviet Union were the second quickest. It was a comparative story in the last; Australia were third at each change. Regardless of Wenden securing the Australians with the quickest split among every one of the 32 swimmers in the race, the Australians missed the silver award by simply 0.5Â s. In the 4Â ÃÂ 200Â m free-form hand-off, Windle won a silver alongside Wenden, Rogers and Graham White. The group of four won their warmth and qualified quickest, while the Americans qualified second with their second-decision group. In any case, utilizing their full-quality group in the last, the Americans won by 1.4Â s. Australia were 2.5Â s behind at the midpoint of the race, yet the Americans had the capacity to hang tight, notwithstanding the additions made by Windle and Wenden in the last two legs. 

Windle resigned after the Games, taking note of that "I have swum to that moment that I could scarcely lift myself out of the water. I have seen John Konrads to that point moreover. I would dependably give 110%. There is not a viable alternative for hard and fair work". Windle was normally viewed as the fittest and most diligent individual from the Australian swimming group. In retirement, Windle remained in the United States for a couple of more years, working for Allis-Chalmers, a rural hardware organization. He returned home in the wake of being exchanged to the Australian division of the association's tasks. Windle was drafted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1987 and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1990.
