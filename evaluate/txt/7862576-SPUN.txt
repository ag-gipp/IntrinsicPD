In mid-1917 the United States Shipping Board (USSB) seized and got title to all private shipbuilding ventures in advancement, including the still-inadequate "Oriente" and her sister transport "Orizaba". Plans for the two boats were changed for troop conveying obligations.

Before landing at Brest on 12Â August, she needed to move a few times to avoid conceivable submarine contacts. She landed at New York on 22Â August and was allowed a fourteen day fix period. 

On 4 September, "Siboney" cruised from New York on her fifth intersection and touched base at Saint-Nazaire nine days after the fact. On 15Â September, she set out various injured troops and left Saint-Nazaire that day, in any case, because of overwhelming submarine movement, swung at grapple for a few days before her escort cruised.

After her reacquisition, the Ward Line set SS "Siboney" in transoceanic administration on a New York to Havana, Tenerife, Bilbao, Santander, and Vigo course. On 9Â September 1920, the ship steered into the rocks in the harbor at Vigo. Starting endeavors to re-glide her were fruitless, however by late October, "Siboney" had been sufficiently fixed to make it to Shields. In spite of significant harm, "Siboney" was refitted and set in administration again and, by March 1921, the Ward Line was publicizing entry to Spain by means of Havana on board her. The Ward Line, be that as it may, deserted the New Yorkâ Cubaâ Spain administration later in 1921 because of an absence of travelers. 

By November 1921, "Siboney" was set in New Yorkâ Cubaâ Mexico administration, where business flourished, to a limited extent on account of Prohibition in the United States. Ward Line travels to Havana were one of the snappiest and most economical approaches to what one creator called "liquor advanced get-aways".

Misfortune proceeded for "Siboney" on 5Â January 1929, when she smashed and sank the Bauer Towing Company pull "Phillip Hoffman" off the Battery, murdering the pull's specialist. 

"Siboney" proceeded with her equivalent courses into the 1930s, and by 1933 normal keeps running for "Siboney" were from New York to Havana, Progreso, and Veracruz and back, excluding Progreso on the arrival. On one such return trip from Veracruz and Havana in April 1935, a traveler had $5,000 worth of precious stone and platinum adornments stolen while ready. By 1935, numerous advertising debacles for the Ward Line â the flame and sinking of off New Jersey in 1934 and the establishing of and the sinking of "Mohawk" in the months that pursued â caused the "Ward Line" name to be dropped for the "Cuba Mail Line" moniker. By 1939, "Siboney", still on the New Yorkâ Cubaâ Mexico course, brandished another paint plan of "dove dark" frame and dark channels with white markings to mirror this adjustment in name. In late 1940, be that as it may, the battling Cuba Mail Line sanctioned "Siboney" to American Export Lines which utilized her on Jersey Cityâ Lisbon administration.

In the wake of addressing inquiries from "K-25" yelled by means of amplifier, "Siboney" was permitted to continue her course. Habel documented a challenge with British authorities when "Siboney" docked at Bermuda. 

At the finish of her seventh and last voyage for American Export, "Siboney" was put under time sanction for obligation as an Army transport. After a hurried equipping, the redesignated USAT "Siboney" was given something to do transporting troops. Situated in New York, she influenced excursions to all over the Atlantic and into the Caribbean, and, before the finish of 1941, had called at Bermuda, San Juan, Trinidad, St. John's, Charleston, Newport News, CristÃ³bal, Jamaica, and Panama.

The ship was renamed USAHS "Charles A. Stafford" after Captain Charles A. Stafford of the U.S. Armed force Medical Corps, who was murdered amid the air assault on Broome, Western Australia, while partaking in the clearing of Java on 3Â March 1942. With her change total in September 1944, the "Stafford", outfitted with new boilers, a solitary stack instead of her unique two, and different upgrades, moved to her new homeport of Charleston. From that port the ship made month to month hurries to the United Kingdom and back until May 1945, intruding on the example once for an outing to Gibraltar and Marseilles.
