Wes Anderson previously drew closer Schwartzman and Portman about "Lodging Chevalier" in 2005. Schwartzman and Anderson had recently chipped away at "Rushmore" (1998), Anderson's religion second element, and had been living respectively in Schwartzman's Paris condo in the months paving the way to the shoot. Portman was drawn closer after the chief acquired her email address from Scott Rudin, official maker of 2004's "Closer" in which she featured. The performing artists showed up for nothing, and Anderson financed the rest of the generation himself. 

It was recorded at the HÃ´tel Raphael in Paris, on Avenue KlÃ©ber, two squares south-southwest of the Arc de Triomphe. The HÃ´tel Raphael had recently been utilized as a setting for the movies "Love in Paris" (1996) and "Spot VendÃ´me" (1998). It was shot by a team of 15 in Panavision and utilized props from Anderson's loft. Recording took more than two days, and altering (done on Anderson's PC) one more week. In spite of his utilization of a closet from esteemed style originator Marc Jacobs and a carefully assembled bag from Louis Vuitton, the executive depicted the creation as "like making an understudy film". 

Anderson at first proposed it to be an independent short film, yet presently before taping started, he understood that Schwartzman's character looked somewhat like one of the heroes of a component film he was composing at the time. That film would start generation a year later as "The Darjeeling Limited". "Chevalier" happens two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the component) joins his two more established siblings on a voyage in India in "Darjeeling". The exchange between the characters toward the finish of "Chevalier" is related by Schwartzman's character to his siblings at the end of the component film, as a passage from a short story he has formed. Portman's character has a concise appearance in the component. Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that supported "Darjeeling", was ignorant of the short until the component had been made and professed to have no money related enthusiasm for it. 

"Inn Chevalier" was screened as a feature of the program at the world premiÃ¨re of "The Darjeeling Limited" at the 64th Venice International Film Festival on September 2, 2007. The short had its very own premiÃ¨re at Apple Stores in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco and Santa Monica, California, on September 25. Anderson, Schwartzman and Portman showed up at the New York screening in SoHo, after which they held an inquiries and-answers session with the crowd.

On September 28, it went before the appearing of the element on the premiere night of the 2007 New York Film Festival.

The film was pulled back from iTunes in the wake of having been accessible for download for a month. It had been rejected by "USA Today" writer Susan Wloszczyna before its iTunes discharge as an "interest bouche" that was "bound to be a simple reference". It was downloaded almost multiple times amid its run, and got wide praise. Following its withdrawal from iTunes, the short was appropriated in theaters as the introduction to the full length film. In spite of the fact that "The New York Times" revealed in October 2007 that wholesaler Fox Searchlight Pictures expected to advance "Chevalier" as a contender for the Best Live Action Short Film of the Academy Awards, it was not among that year's assignments. It was incorporated as an additional element on the "Darjeeling" 2008 DVD discharge, and Anderson's screenplay for the short was distributed in the Winter 2007 issue of the scholarly magazine "". 

"Lodging Chevalier" was one of the year's most talked about short movies, and pulled in impressive commendation from film faultfinders, who contrasted it positively with "The Darjeeling Limited". Gary Susman of "Diversion Weekly" depicted it as "a perfect short story where we learn not much but rather precisely enough about these two characters", including that ""Chevalier" sees Anderson working in his standard gem box/dollhouse mode, yet the structure and length truly suit each other here." Armond White of "New York Press" made a decision about the short "moving and really contemporary", refering to its "lost-young lady impact". The film drew some consideration for Portman's all-encompassing naked scene, and for her character's wounded body. Portman communicated dissatisfaction at this undue center, saying "[i]t truly discouraged me that half of each survey ... was about the nakedness". The scene influenced the on-screen character to reexamine the insight of this part of her execution, and she in this way swore off naked appearances in film. 

While "The Darjeeling Limited" received commonly positive auditsâhaving achieved a 68% endorsement rating on the survey aggregator Rotten Tomatoesâa large number of the heroes of "Lodging Chevalier" would in general consolidate recognition of "Chevalier" with inconspicuous shots at "Darjeeling". Portman's execution was adulated by "TIME" analyst Richard Corliss, who proclaimed her to be "a comic on-screen character in crisp blossom" in the "dumbfounding vignette", and communicated his desire that her job in "Darjeeling" had been more noteworthy. The component, he felt, came up short on "the inclination and mind of the short film". Stephanie Zacharek of "Salon" agreed, expressing that "the untold story of "Lodging Chevalier" is multiple times all the more intriguing, and interminably more extravagant, than the one told out and out in ", and calling the short "exceptionally near impeccable". "The Guardian" reporter Danny Leigh differentiated the tepid gathering of the component among bloggers and commentators with the "certifiable fervency" that welcomed the "splendidly estimated account" of "Chevalier". He recommended that the imperatives of the short-film group fit Anderson, whose trademark vacant cleverness, peculiar set plans and decision of soundtrack slanted to deplete the watchers' understanding in a full length work. A. O. Scott of "The New York Times" hailed "Chevalier" as "a little diamond" in contrast with the "overstuffed bag" of the element, and composed that "It merits searching out, not just in light of the fact that it fleshes out piece of the narrative of the Whitman siblings yet additionally on the grounds that, all alone, it is a practically ideal refining of Mr. Anderson's vexing and charming gifts, puzzling, influencing and wry."
