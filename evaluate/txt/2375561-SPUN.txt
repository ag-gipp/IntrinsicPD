Furthermore, the end result for Neptune? He gets 'executed by ten million pounds of ooze from New York to New Jersey.' Same thing with the "animal in the sky," who stalls out up there in a gap in the ozone layer. Man the perfect sign successfully bites the dust, and what remains is his corrupted creature nature; the chintzy corona stuck on the primate's head is the image of that troubled fall".
