Right off the bat in his profession Paul guaranteed himself that he would dependably expound on the things he knew well. In her audit of "Ellis Paul Live" for the Folk and Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz stated, "His finely sharpened melodies recount stories loaded up with pictures that radiance like gems.

In a 2002 article, Thomas Conner analyzed a refrain from Paul's "Discussion with a Ghost" from "State Something". "Rather than gruffly saying, "I kept running into a past love interest in Central Park", Paul composes around it, dodging the buzzwords, painting the image, demonstrating us everythingâthe thought processes, the setting, the luckâaside from what we anticipate." 

When instructing songwriting classes, Paul regularly acquaints hopeful musicians with his "six-advance program to successful songwriting" which depends on the reason that lyricists should appear and not tell. Paul instructs this six-advance strategy to build up a character in a tune: 

The most imperative guidance he gives hopeful musicians is to compose what you know or what you've encountered. "Use reality as the springboard to whatever no doubt about it", Paul said. Paul likewise says that being an effective musician resembles being a columnist who expounds on what he sees and knows, the occasions individuals are living in and the things individuals are confronting today. "The writer watches out the window and expounds on what is truly occurring." "I ensure it's genuine. I would prefer not to fictionalize about things I haven't seen." Paul expresses that throughout the years he's found out the estimation of straightforwardness recorded as a hard copy. He's discovered that he can say more when he composes all the more basically and direct. "It's as though you can be mind boggling and perplexing by embracing a shorter, less confounded structure." "I'm not doing advanced science - I'm a storyteller", he said. "I plan to motivate individuals to think and believe and to exit with more than they came in with." 

At the point when requested to portray the distinction between composing melodies for kids and tune for grown-ups, Paul stated: "The contrast between composing a children's tune and a grown-up tune is that in the children's tunes you will in general utilize essential hues and the words are more brilliant and the beats are constantly playful. There's a subtlety to the grown-up tunes that is extraordinary. It's as yet the narrating, however its distinctive shades and points. You read between the lines more." 

Paul keeps playing near 200 dates yearly on the people circuit. His tunes have showed up on in excess of 50 gathering CDs, and he has shown up on the collections of specialists including Lori McKenna, David Wilcox and Mark Erelli. Whenever inquired as to whether he would prefer to play the 19,600-situate Fleet Theater or the 900-situate Somerville Theater â both in Boston, Paul answered, "I like to keep it close. That way individuals can see the whites of your eyes. I'd love to compose a hit melody and have it on the radio like "American Pie" or something, however I'm simply going to do what I do and take what I can and keep running with it, since it's a hard business to have even what I have. So I don't have la-la-land Springsteen-esque expectations. I simply need to compose extraordinary tunes." 

In a survey for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz stated, "Ellis Paul is a standout amongst the best vocalist/musicians of his age. Furthermore, for a significant number of us he is the essence of contemporary society musicâfew are as brilliant, as educated and as graceful as Paul.
