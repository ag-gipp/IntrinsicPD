"Prison Siege" is an activity pretending amusement set in a pseudo-medieval high dreamland, displayed in 3D with a third-individual virtual camera framework under the control of the player, in which the player characters explore the territory and ward off unfriendly animals. The player picks the sex and redoes the presence of the principle character of the story before the beginning of the amusement and ordinarily controls them.

The gathering shields themselves and assaults adversaries utilizing skirmish and ran weapons, and nature and battle enchantment. The player does not choose a character class for the characters, not at all like other pretending computer games; rather, utilizing weapons or enchantment of a specific kind builds the character's aptitude with them after some time. At whatever point a player increases enough experience focuses from murdering foes and achieves another dimension in that weapon type, they increase some measure of focuses in their quality, aptitude, or insight measurements, which thusly identify with the measure of wellbeing focuses and mana that they have, and harm that they do with weapons. 

Characters can prepare weapons, shield, rings, and special necklaces, which give assault or guard focuses, or offer rewards to some other measurement. There are likewise usable things, for example, elixirs to reestablish a character's wellbeing or mana. Weapons, reinforcement, and different things are found by executing adversaries, breaking holders, or by buy from merchants. Each character has a stock, spoke to as a fixed network, with every thing delineated by a shape occupying environments on the framework. One character type, the donkey, can't utilize weapons or enchantment, however has an a lot bigger stock. 

"Prison Siege" has both a solitary player and multiplayer mode. The single-player mode comprises of a solitary story and world; players can either make another character when beginning the story or utilize one made in an earlier playthrough. The helpful multiplayer mode takes into account up to eight players to play through either the single-player storyline or in the multiplayer map, which includes a focal town center point with progressively troublesome foes as players move far from it. Multiplayer diversions can be set to various trouble levels, permitting settlement of higher-leveled characters. Extra maps can be made by players that can consider aggressive multiplayer. Multiplayer matches can be made and joined by means of neighborhood, direct IP addresses, and, preceding its conclusion in 2006, through the Microsoft Zone matchmaking administration. 

"Prison Siege" is set in the Kingdom of Ehb, a differed district on the mainland of Aranna containing deserts, marshes, timberlands, and mountains, made three centuries sooner at the disintegration of the Empire of Stars. Toward the start of the amusement, the player character's cultivating town is assaulted by a race of animals named the Krug. The primary character, a rancher with no given foundation who is named by the player, travels through the Krug powers to the town of Stonebridge. After breaking the attack of the town, and picking up their first friend, the player character is entrusted by the town's battalion chief Gyorn with traveling to the town of Glacern and cautioning the Ehb military powers, called the tenth Legion, of the invasion and crushing any powers they experience en route. Subsequent to venturing through sepulchers, mines, and mountains, the player character comes to Glacern, where they are educated that the Krug attack happened that day that the Grand Mage Merik vanished, and are accused of making a trip over the mountains to Fortress Kroth to help the army there. In the mountains they discover Merik, who advises them that the Krug intrusion is a piece of a bigger attack by the Seck, who annihilated the Empire of Stars before being detained underneath Castle Ehb, and who have gotten away and taken the chÃ¢teau.

The player battles through beasts and criminals in precious stone gives in, a woodland, a bog, and an underground Goblin fortification loaded up with mechanical war machines. Subsequent to recouping the Staff from the Goblins, the player character meets a division of the tenth Legion and is pointed towards Fortress Kroth, which has been overwhelm with undead. Subsequent to clearing the post and battling beasts and a mythical serpent in the Cliffs of Fire, they walk on Castle Ehb. The player characters at that point storm the mansion and battle through the Seck powers to protect King Konreid.

Gas Powered Games was established in May 1998 by Chris Taylor, at that point known for the 1997 continuous procedure diversion "All out Annihilation". Joined by a few of his collaborators from Cavedog Entertainment, Taylor needed to make an alternate sort of amusement than previously, and subsequent to attempting a few ideas the group chose to make an activity pretending diversion as their first title. Just as making the underlying idea, Taylor filled in as one of the planners for the diversion, joined by Jacob McMahon as the amusement's other lead originator and maker and Neal Hallford as the diversion's lead story and discourse essayist. Hallford was brought onto the undertaking after it had just begun; Taylor had contrived the begin and end of the amusement however left the mediating subtleties and foundation story to him. The amusement's music was made by Jeremy Soule, who had likewise taken a shot at "Absolute Annihilation". The advancement group included around thirty individuals amid improvement, with changes after some time, and achieved forty at the task's decision. The improvement of the amusement took more than four years, however it was at first wanted to take just two. 

"Prison Siege" was motivated by earlier pretending amusements, for example, "Baldur's Gate" and the "Ultima" arrangement, however basically by "Diablo", which Taylor appreciated for having an encounter that "focused on activity" that players could hop into without first looking into the ongoing interaction subtleties and settings. Taylor needed to extend that idea into a streamlined, vivid, and activity overwhelming pretending amusement that expelled regular components of the class that he discovered exhausting, disappointing, or moderate. Taylor additionally needed to make the ongoing interaction itself less difficult than contemporary pretending amusements, to speak to a more extensive gathering of people. Keeping that in mind, he asked Hallford to create an account that was additionally quick and streamlined; he had him compose a point by point backstory for the amusement, which would not be displayed to players but rather would illuminate and move the designers, leaving the in-diversion content controlled to keep players drew in with the activity. Hallford portrayed the way toward composing for the amusement as like other diversion ventures, other than a more noteworthy accentuation on curtness, however he has said that he was brought onto the undertaking a lot later than he typically is, which implied that he needed to make a story that filled in as a foundation to the set pieces that had just been created. The plot of the diversion was planned by Taylor to be subordinate to the ongoing interaction; keeping that in mind, he was unconcerned that his general story bend was considered, even by the advancement group, to be fairly a banality, as he felt that venturing to vanquish an "extreme shrewdness" was rousing to players. Taylor and Hallford examined creating a "Prison Siege" novel to investigate Hallford's story, however it never worked out as intended. 

Taylor needed to additionally enhance the "Diablo" pretending amusement equation by expelling the idea of picking a character class at all and discarding "Diablo"s long stacking occasions. The advancement group likewise attempted to make the amusement progressively streamlined by expelling the need to backtrack to recently visited towns to sell things, by adding inventories to friend characters and pack donkeys. At a certain point being developed, they intended to have a "partner" character who might get things dropped by foes to give the player a chance to abstain from doing as such themselves. The designers likewise changed a few components that were standard in pretending recreations that Taylor and different engineers discovered baffling, for example, giving players a chance to exchange things to merchants at a similar cost that they were purchased for rather than a precarious markdown, and "tasting" or just mostly utilizing mixtures rather than continually spending the entire thing. 

Gas Powered Games incorporated their diversion improvement device, called the Siege Editor, as an instrument for players to mod the amusement. Having seen the yield of players making mods for "All out Annihilation", Taylor needed to "take that to the outrageous" and give a full arrangement of devices to encourage a network of players improving and changing the amusement after discharge. He felt that the apparatuses, which could enable players to make new diversion universes, characters, and ongoing interaction, would help bolster an extensive, long haul network of players around the amusement. Gas Powered Games trusted that giving what Daily Radar called "a standout amongst the most thorough dimension toolsets we've at any point seen" would enable players to rapidly and effectively make little amusement locales, just as permit progressively genuine modders the capacity to create whole parallel recreations utilizing the "Cell Siege" diversion motor. They likewise trusted that this modding network would most likely improve and expand the multiplayer ongoing interaction past what they could discharge. Taylor credited his excitement for discharging their very own improvement instruments for modding to the two his delight in observing mods for "All out Annihilation" delivered a long time after its discharge just as the absence of negative results to John Carmack and id Software's verifiable inclination to discharge the whole source code to their recreations. Taylor later assessed that the organization spent around 20% of their financial plan on building up the modding instruments. 

After the principal year of advancement, Gas Powered Games found that they were not going to have the capacity to complete the diversion inside the arranged two years; not exclusively was the consistent world without stacking screens more diligently to make than they had suspected, at the same time, as per lead designer Bartosz Kijanka, they had been overambitious in picking what number of creative highlights they could put into the amusement's custom motor, for example, the wide range through which the virtual camera framework could zoom in and out. Different highlights upheld and later dropped included permitting up to ten characters without a moment's delayâand along these lines keeping up to ten zones of the single-player worldârather than the last limit of eight, and a climate framework that included breeze passing shots over course. As per Kijanka, the engineers likewise invested a ton of energy changing innovations mid-improvement, for example, constructing a custom activity proofreader before moving to an authorized one, and beginning with the OpenGL designs library just to change to Direct3D. Accordingly, the group was required to work 12â 14 hour days and ends of the week for a large portion of the advancement time so as to finish the diversion inside four years. In a 2011 meeting, Taylor expressed that by and large the last expense being developed time of the consistent world may have been excessively high, and furthermore that the group attempted to make excessively vast of a diversion for their financial plan; he trusted that an amusement with more like 35 hours of recess rather than 70 would have been a superior and increasingly cleaned experience given their imperatives. 

By 2000, Gas Powered Games had started to scan for a distributer for the amusement. Taylor asserts that different distributers were keen on the diversion, yet he was persuaded by Ed Fries to cooperate with the recently settled Microsoft PC distributing gathering. Despite the fact that Microsoft's distributing wing was set up to some extent to distribute amusements for the recently reported Xbox support, Gas Powered Games and Microsoft did not firmly think about conveying the diversion to the comfort. Taylor trusts this was because of the span of the diversion itself, just as the little market for pretending amusements on consoles at the time. "Prison Siege" was at first gotten ready for discharge in the second from last quarter of 2001, preceding being postponed to the next year, and Gas Powered Games invested the additional energy tuning and cleaning the amusement and growing the diversion's things and multiplayer highlights. "Prison Siege" was discharged for Microsoft Windows on April 5, 2002, by Microsoft, and for Mac OS X on May 2, 2003, by Destineer. 

"Prison Siege" was industrially fruitful, selling over 1.7 million duplicates. As per the NPD Group, preorders of the amusement in the month prior to its discharge made it the eighth-top of the line PC round of March 2002, and upon discharge in the next month it rose to second-smash hit, after "The Sims: Vacation". It tumbled to seventh and after that thirteenth spot the accompanying two months, and completed in fourteenth spot for the year by and large. By August 2006, it had sold 360,000 duplicates and earned $14.5 million in the United States alone. This drove "Edge" to proclaim it the nation's 44th-smash hit PC amusement between January 2000 and August 2006. By September 2002, "Prison Siege" had likewise gotten a "Gold" confirmation from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), showing offers of something like 100,000 units crosswise over Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 

The amusement was profoundly appraised by faultfinders upon discharge; it is recorded by survey aggregator Metacritic as the third-most elevated evaluated PC pretending round of 2002, behind "Neverwinter Nights" and "", and the twenty-first-most noteworthy PC diversion in general for the year. The illustrations were exceptionally commended; Dan Adams of IGN called it "absurdly beautiful to watch", while analysts for GameSpot and "GamePro" applauded the conditions as being nitty gritty and fluctuated. Robert Coffey of "PC Gaming World" and Greg Vederman of "PC Gamer" comparatively commended the nitty gritty situations, while Andy McNamara and Kristian Brogger of "Diversion Informer" and GameSpy's Peter Suciu got out the consistent world without stacking screens as particularly deserving of note. Suciu further adulated how the freestyle, consistent guide was utilized to make territories that were not molded like rectangular districts with a winding way topping off the space, as was average with other pretending rounds of the time. The IGN and "GamePro" commentators recognized the audio effects as astounding and for making the environment of the amusement, while the IGN and GameSpot analysts likewise applauded the "surrounding instrumental score". 

The ongoing interaction was likewise praised; the "GamePro" survey guaranteed that ""Dungeon Siege"s interactivity is maybe its greatest and most straightforward improvement over past titles in the class." Several commentators contrasted it positively with "Diablo II" (2000), at that point a standout amongst the most well known PC activity pretending diversions, with Adams of IGN asserting that it was fundamentally the same as "Diablo II" with certain progressions and enhancements, and Coffey of "PC Gaming World" expressing that the main thing shielding it from being legitimately appraised as better was that the move to an increasingly strategic interactivity made it excessively unique of an amusement to straightforwardly look at. "PC Gamer"s Vederman, "PC Gaming World"s Coffey, and the GameSpot analyst commended the interactivity as being streamlined and available; they preferred the strategic idea of controlling a gathering of explorers who improved by how they were utilized instead of legitimately controlling their activities and measurements. IGN's Adams, in any case, said that the interactivity could get dull, Vederman of "PC Gamer" felt that the ongoing interaction battle decisions were to some degree constrained, and GameSpy's Suciu detested the linearity of the single-player diversion. Adams further included that a significant number of the strategic decisions in the diversion were irrelevant, as all fights immediately lapsed into fights, and that the freestyle arrangement of leveling was basically equivalent to four character classes as seeking after numerous tracks was incapable. 

The multiplayer content got blended audits: Adams adulated the measure of extra substance, while Suciu and the GameSpot commentator noticed that the multiplayer interactivity could without much of a stretch become lopsided between various players. The single-player plot was commonly expelled as irrelevant: the "GamePro" commentator named it "skeletal" and the "Amusement Informer" analysts "dull", and the GameSpot analyst called it "flat and forgettable" and inferred that players who needed a "more profound pretending diversion" would be baffled. By and large, Vederman of "PC Gamer" called "Cell Siege" "a standout amongst the best, most pleasant rounds of the year" and "GamePro"s commentator guaranteed it "mistreats its opposition with practically easy beauty", while Adams of IGN inferred that it was engaging however had "undiscovered potential". 

After it was exhibited at E3 2000, "Cell Siege" continued to win the Best RPG grant from Game Revolution and Most Immersive Role-playing Game honor from GameSpot. After discharge, it was assigned for the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences' 2003 Annual Interactive Achievement Awards in the Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year and Innovation in Computer Gaming classes, however it didn't win either, losing to "Neverwinter Nights" and "Combat zone 1942", separately. The diversion was additionally a chosen one for "PC Gamer US"s "2002 Best Roleplaying Game" grant, yet lost again to "Neverwinter Nights". It won the Best PC Game Graphics grant from IGN. 

Gas Powered Games' arrival of the Siege Editor sparked the ascent of a modding network around the amusement; even before discharge a few modding bunches declared goals to utilize the motor to make vast scale mods changing diversions from the "Ultima" arrangement of pretending recreations. After the amusement's discharge, various mods were made, including a few "absolute change" mods that made entirely new recreations and stories, for example, "The Lands of Hyperborea" and "Essential". Gas Powered Games discharged one mod of their own in July 2002 titled "Yesterhaven", made by six originators more than about a month and a half, which gave a short multiplayer storyline to low-level characters wherein they protected a town from three topical maladies of beasts. It was followed up by "Legends of Aranna", a full extension pack created by Mad Doc Software and discharged on November 11, 2003 for Windows and Mac OS X by Microsoft. The development pack included minimal new ongoing interaction other than new territories, animals, and things, however highlighted a totally isolated story from the first diversion. In "Legends", the player controls another anonymous rancher; after the Staff of Stars is stolen by an animal called the Shadowjumper, they set off to recover it. In the wake of battling their way through beasts in frigid slopes, wildernesses, and islands, the player lands at the magical Great Clock, a monster ancient rarity which controls Aranna's seasons. There they rout the Shadowjumper and recover the Staff of Stars. It got commonly more negative audits than the first, with commentators adulating the measure of substance yet condemning the absence of changes to the base ongoing interaction. 

A few different amusements have been discharged in the "Cell Siege" arrangement, starting with "Prison Siege II" (2005). That amusement got its own extension pack, "" (2006), and was trailed by a spinoff PlayStation Portable diversion titled "" (2006) and a third primary title, "Cell Siege III" (2011). A motion picture coordinated by Uwe Boll and roused by the first amusement, "In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale", was discharged in theaters in 2007; it has been portrayed as being "approximately based" on the diversion, and was a business and basic disappointment. It was trailed by the home video continuations "" (2011) and "" (2014).
