In 1939, Grove had a particular amusement while pitching against the Tulsa Oilers. Playing in a night diversion with practically no light because of tempests, Grove did not permit a hit amid his time on the hill, yet earned the misfortune since he strolled three men in succession, which enabled a raced to score. As the 1940 season started, Grove turned into a piece of the White Sox program and started his Major League vocation. 

Amid spring preparing in 1940, Hall of Fame pitcher Ted Lyons said that Grove would have an incredible vocation, expressing, "They'll never drive that sinker exceptionally far." Grove was an official piece of the 40-man program as the 1940 season started (groups began as opposed to finished the season with 40 men right now), however had not shown up following a month on the list. The White Sox intended to utilize three new kid on the block pitchers, including Grove, amid the last seven day stretch of May, as they had three doubleheaders that week. Forest made his Major League debut on May 28, 1940. He contributed two additional amusements for the White Sox that season before being sent back to Oklahoma City.

Entanglements emerged presently as a sore created on the back of his knee, provoking another activity in December to address the issue. 

As the 1943 season started, the White Sox held solid questions about Grove's status as a pitcher. They were so far fetched of his recuperation from knee medical procedure that Grove was marked to a $1 contract until he could demonstrate that his playing capacity was back keeping pace with the capacities of the other White Sox pitchers. After Grove substantiated himself in spring preparing, supervisor Jimmy Dykes gave him his first significant trial of the period against the New York Yankees in alleviation of Eddie Smith. He won in additional innings, and was set in the beginning pivot. In 1943, Grove needed to manage issues identified with World War II and the specific administration.

Forest exploited his place in Chicago's beginning revolution by winning nine back to back choices to begin his season and by not losing a diversion until a challenge against the Yankees, which he lost as the aftereffect of a shy away. At the time, Grove turned into the second individual from the White Sox to win nine back to back choices to begin a season. The primary pitcher to win nine straight diversions for the group was Lefty Williams in 1917, and the just a single to do it since Grove was LaMarr Hoyt in 1982. On July 8, 1943, Grove almost ended up one of only a handful couple of pitchers in baseball history to pitch a no-hitter. In an amusement against the Yankees, he was one out far from pitching a no-hitter when Joe Gordon came fixing to make something happen.

By mid-season, Grove had seven successes, six misfortunes, five complete diversions, and a 3.40 ERA. In view of these insights, he was chosen to the American League All-Star group, his solitary vocation appearance. Five American League pitchers contributed the All-Star Game on July 11, in spite of the fact that Grove was one of the four on the program who did not; in this manner, his solitary All-Star appearance was without a doubt just an appearance. Amid the second 50% of the period, Grove performed well at Comiskey Park, yet battled out and about, at one point losing five straight recreations regardless of good run help from the White Sox. Forest completed the season with 14 wins, 15 misfortunes, an ERA of 3.72, two shutouts, and a vocation best of almost 235 innings pitched. 

There was a feeling of conclusion for Grove before the start of the 1945 season, as he was granted $310 ($ today) in harms for the car crash in 1941. He waited for another agreement in the off-season, lastly marked with the White Sox two or three weeks before the start of the period subsequent to turning into the final holdout.

He completed the season with 217 pitched innings, a lifelong best four shutouts, a 14â 12 record, and a 3.44 ERA. 

The 1946 season saw Grove persevere as a steady piece of the White Sox pitching pivot. He contributed 33 diversions amid the season, second to nearer Earl Caldwell, and began in 26, second to Ed Lopat's 29. His best trip of the period happened on August 3 against the Washington Senators. Forest pitched a total amusement and tossed to the base 27 hitters, permitting three hits and a walk, which were all invalidated by twofold plays. He completed the season with a larger number of misfortunes than wins since he was anxious to succeed and was making a decent attempt, and on account of this the instructing staff intended to make Grove into "as great a pitcher more often than not as he is a portion of the time". Toward the finish of the 1946 season, Grove had eight successes and 13 misfortunes, a 3.02 ERA, 10 complete recreations, and a group driving 10 wild pitches. 

Amid the off-season, while arrangements were in progress for the 1947 season, Grove was the subject of exchange discourses. Most prominently, White Sox chief Ted Lyons and Cleveland Indians president Bill Veeck examined exchanging him for Indians pitcher Steve Gromek, however the arrangement was nixed when they couldn't go to an understanding. As the season started, Grove remained some portion of the turn, which was driven by Lopat and included Joe Haynes and Frank Papish. While Grove began off the season well, he battled through the center of the year, going from May 18 to August 2 without winning an amusement. Thus, he was sidelined, and completed the season with 19 begins in 25 pitching appearances. Out of the blue, Grove completed a full season with an ERA above 4.00.

Lytton's retail establishment in Chicago. 

In the 1948 season, the White Sox confronted troublesome choices with respect to their pitching staff and beginning turn. Amidst Caldwell's flight and Papish's nonappearance for a large portion of the preseason, Grove remained a starter heading into the season, having pitched sufficiently amid spring preparing. In his last presentation matchup of the period against Johnny Schmitz, Grove pitched the full nine innings and the White Sox vanquished the Chicago Cubs 1â 0, making Grove the main White Sox pitcher to toss a total amusement amid the preseason.

In any case, Grove in the long run lost his beginning employment, and before the finish of the period, he had two successes, 10 misfortunes, a 6.16 ERA, and had begun 11 recreations out of 32 absolute pitching appearances. 

As the 1949 season started, Grove was again the subject of exchange gossipy tidbits. The Detroit Tigers consented to exchange an outfielder, apparently Don Lund or Jimmy Outlaw, in return for Grove, despite the fact that the Tigers precluded the presence from claiming such an arrangement, expressing "We need pitching, yet I don't figure Grove would support us." Grove pitched one amusement amid the season on April 27, 1949, permitting four keeps running in 66% of an inning. In his one appearance against the Indians, he hit Lou Boudreau with a pitch, which provoked worry until X-beams uncovered Boudreau's left elbow was just wounded. 

Right away a short time later, Grove was downgraded to the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League, having pitched his last significant association amusement. Amid his debut season at Sacramento, he was a piece of a pitching group of four that included Ken Holcombe, Bob Gillespie, and Frank Dasso, and was pronounced by "Brandishing News" sportswriter John B. Old as "the best any Coast League club at any point had." Over the course of the following three seasons, Grove kept on pitching for the Solons.

His agreement with the Solons guaranteed him a player in the price tag in the event that he was sold to the majors. At the point when this did not happen, he considered stopping baseball and dedicating himself full-time to his uncle's trucking business. Be that as it may, Grove kept on playing, and contributed 159 innings 1951, arranging a 8â 9 record. There was discussion of his resigning in the off-season; notwithstanding, Grove wound up having influence of the 1952 season, making his season debut on June 10 and playing for the remainder of the period.

After his retirement from baseball, Grove kept on working with his uncle. His heritage lived on in his nephew, Wayne Grove. While playing for the Bellwood Lions of the Chicago Little League, Wayne pitched a no-hitter and struck out 15, and barely missed an ideal diversion when a sprinter jumped on base with two outs in the base of the ninth inning. Regardless of an unremarkable Major League profession, Grove earned a couple of votes in favor of enlistment into the Hall of Fame, accepting five votes in the 1958 balloting (1.9% of the required votes required) and seven in the 1960 balloting (2.6% of the required votes required).
