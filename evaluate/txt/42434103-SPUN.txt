The Boat Race 2003 

The 149th Boat Race occurred on 6 April 2003. Held yearly, the Boat Race is a next to each other paddling race between groups from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along a tidal stretch of the River Thames in south-west London. The lead changed twice amid the race, which Oxford won by one foot (30Â cm), the littlest edge of triumph ever of occasion. The nearby race has been depicted as "epic", while numerous Olympic gold-medallist Steve Redgrave recommended that the race was the "best we will find in our lifetimes". 

Umpired by the Boat Race veteran Boris Rankov, the 2003 race was the first to be planned on a Sunday. Because of an impact between the Cambridge pontoon and a dispatch, an individual from the Cambridge group was supplanted only two days before the race. This was the primary Boat Race to include two arrangements of siblings on restricting sides. In the hold race Goldie beat Isis and Oxford won the Women's race. 

The Boat Race is a one next to the other paddling rivalry between the University of Oxford (once in a while alluded to as the "Dim Blues") and the University of Cambridge (here and there alluded to as the "Light Blues"). First held in 1829, the race happens on the Championship Course, among Putney and Mortlake on the River Thames in south-west London. The competition is a noteworthy purpose of respect between the two colleges; it is pursued all through the United Kingdom and communicate around the world. Oxford went into the 2003 race as authoritative bosses, having won the earlier year's race by 75% of a length, however Cambridge drove generally speaking with 77 triumphs to Oxford's 70 (barring the "dead warmth to Oxford by five feet" of 1877). The race was supported by Aberdeen Asset Management for the fourth continuous year, and was the first to be booked on a Sunday, so as to keep away from a conflict with the live transmission of the Grand National. Despite the fact that the 1984 race was hung on a Sunday, it had been deferred from the Saturday following a crash between the Cambridge pontoon and a canal boat. 

The main Women's Boat Race occurred in 1927, yet did not turn into a yearly apparatus until the 1960s. Up until 2014, the challenge was directed as a major aspect of the Henley Boat Races, however as of the 2015 race, it is hung on the River Thames, on a similar day as the men's fundamental and save races. The save race, challenged between Oxford's Isis vessel and Cambridge's Goldie pontoon, has been held since 1965. It for the most part happens on the Tideway, before the primary Boat Race. 

The umpire for the race was previous Oxford rower Boris Rankov, who had spoken to the Dark Blues a record multiple times somewhere in the range of 1978 and 1983. Cambridge were trained by Robin Williams (for the ninth time) while Oxford's mentor was Sean Bowden, helped by coxing counselor Dan Topolski. 

Wayne Pommen, the principal decision Cambridge bow, was harmed two days before the race, cracking his wrist following a full-speed impact with the harbourmaster's dispatch amid a training begin. Matthias Kleinz was hit on the head yet did not require medicinal consideration. Cambridge number seven James Livingston stated: "For two or three seconds I thought I was going to pass on. We were going level out and out of the blue I heard Jim's voice. I've never heard such a great amount of dread in anyone's voice previously." Pommen was meticulous: "A couple of us were feeling very fortunate last nightÂ ... in the meantime, it was exceptionally baffling and disappointingÂ ... however, there was no point sulking in the corner." Three paddles were crushed and two riggers bowed; the pontoon was sent to Weybridge to be fixed. Pommen was supplanted by Ben Smith, sibling of the Oxford stroke Matthew. Not since the 1979 race had such a late switch in the line-up of a team been made. Alongside James and David Livingston, this was the first run through in the historical backdrop of the Boat Race that two sets of siblings would race against each other. 

The authority say something occurred on 1 April at the London Eye. The Cambridge group had leeway of per part, speaking to the biggest uniqueness between the teams since the 1990 occasion and the lightest Dark Blue group since the 1975 race. Oxford were considered "dark horses" for the race. The Cambridge group had a normal age of 23, while Oxford's team arrived at the midpoint of 21. The Oxford team highlighted seven Britons, an Australian and a Canadian, while the Cambridge group comprised of four Britons, two Americans, two Germans and an Australian. Cambridge's Tim Wooge, the 30-year-old stroke paddling in his third Boat Race, was the primary German leader of Cambridge University Boat Club, and the heaviest man in the race. His Dark Blue partner Matthew Smith was paddling in his fourth Boat Race. Robin Bourne-Taylor, Basil Dixon and Matt Smith had paddled for Oxford in the 2002 race, while, in James Livingston, Cambridge saw only one Blue come back from the earlier year's occasion. 

Cambridge won the coin hurl and the Light Blue pontoon club president, Tim Wooge, was clear: "Cambridge pick Surrey". Cambridge chose to begin from the southern bank (the "Surrey side") of the Thames, giving the northern side of the stream (the "Middlesex side") to Oxford. At race time, conditions were cloudy and windy. Oxford took an early lead with a somewhat higher stroke rate than Cambridge as both coxes were cautioned by the umpire to evade a conflict. By the Mile Post, the Dark Blues were a large portion of a-second ahead. Five minutes into the race, Oxford, with 33% of a length lead, were cautioned again by the umpire and moved far from the dashing line, and following a progression of paddle conflicts, enabled Cambridge to lead the pack, shooting Hammersmith Bridge a second ahead. Oxford kept on keeping in contact with Cambridge along the long center twist of the course, towards the Chiswick Steps, and retook the lead on the way to deal with Barnes Bridge as the course bended back to support them. With a three-quarter length lead at Barnes, Oxford started to debilitate and Cambridge recuperated to 33% of a length. With each stroke, the Cambridge vessel picked up on Oxford, outrating them in a "run complete", yet the Dark Blues passed the completing post ahead, the tightest winning edge ever of race. 

Oxford completed with a period of 18Â minutes 6Â seconds. Rankov did not at first report the outcome, rather he "spread his arms wide and shrugged his shoulders". The outcome was affirmed to Rankov by completing judge Ben Kent, with the triumphant edge being around 0.05Â seconds, and reported to the groups by Rankov under Chiswick Bridge: "One foot to Oxford". James Livingston composed of himself toward the completion: "eyes broaden and swell with sickening dread. Our devastation is complete." 

It was the first run through a group had won the race with a shortfall of more than one stone (6.4Â kg) per man. It was Oxford's third triumph in the past four years and brought the general outcome to 77â 71 to support Cambridge. Toward the get done with, following custom, the Oxford team tossed their cox, Acer Nethercott, into the water in festivity. 

In the hold race, Cambridge's Goldie beat Oxford's Isis by nine lengths in a period of 18Â minutes 4Â seconds, two seconds snappier than the Blue pontoon, recording their fourth back to back triumph and their 6th in seven years. Prior, Oxford won the 58th ladies' race in a period of 6Â minutes 35Â seconds, three-and-a-half lengths in front of their Light Blue adversaries. It was their second back to back win and took the general outcome to 38â 20 to support Cambridge. 

The Oxford University Boat Club president and stroke Matthew Smith said "It feels fabulous and I figure it will require a significant stretch of time to top this inclination". He proceeded to state: "We have an amazing cluster of folks in this squadÂ ... however, I have such regard for CambridgeÂ ... with a lighter group we've turned round the greatest weight shortage ever." Nethercott commented "I truly thought we had lost. In about a couple of moments I went from the absolute bottom in my life to supreme, unbridled happiness." The Cambridge rower James Livingston said "It was the most exceedingly bad edge to lose by. I simply wish I could quit losing these epic races" while the Cambridge mentor Williams portrayed the annihilation as a "hit to the heart". Wooge was disillusioned: "I dismantle my cap off to Oxford, that was an astounding race." Rankov later uncovered "It's the hardest I've at any point needed to work in an umpiring circumstance." 

The five-time Olympic gold medallist Steve Redgrave, who displayed the trophy to the successful president, Matthew Smith, remarked on the race: "Recollect that race and stick on to the memory, since it will be the best we will find in any of our lifetimes." An expected 400 million individuals overall viewed the occasion on TV, with over 5Â million watchers viewing on BBC One in the United Kingdom. The race is retold in the book "Blood Over Water", composed by contradicting siblings James and David Livingston. 

Martin Cross, writing in "The Guardian", said the race gave "an exciting completion and reestablished enthusiasm from general society", Christopher Dodd in "The Independent" called the race "spectacular, a titanic battle of will", while Rachel Quarrell of "The Daily Telegraph" pronounced Oxford's triumph as "epic" and recommended that "there will never be a superior Boat Race." Simon Barnes of "The Times" portrayed the completion: "At the end goal, the bobble of the Oxford bow was crawls in front, after a second, it was creeps behind. On the off chance that the line had accompanied the finishing instead of the start of the last Cambridge stroke, the outcome would have gone the other way." Author and writer Christopher Dodd, sending in "Paddling News" condensed the race as "inconceivable" and a "titanic battle of wills".
