US Bicentennial coinage 

The United States Bicentennial coinage was a lot of circling dedicatory coins, comprising of a quarter, half dollar and dollar struck by the United States Mint in 1975 and 1976. Notwithstanding when struck, each coin bears the twofold date 1776â 1976 on the ordinary front-sides for the Washington quarter, Kennedy half dollar and Eisenhower dollar. No coins dated 1975 of any of the three divisions were printed. 

Given past maltreatment in the framework, the Mint pushed against the issuance of dedicatory coins beginning during the 1950s. Starting in 1971, individuals from Congress acquainted bills with approve coins to respect the United States Bicentennial, which would happen in 1976. The Mint, through its executive, Mary Brooks, at first contradicted such recommendations, yet later upheld them, and Congress passed enactment requiring the transitory overhaul of the invert of the quarter, half dollar and dollar. 

An across the country rivalry brought about plans of a Colonial drummer for the quarter, Independence Hall for the half dollar and the Liberty Bell superimposed against the moon for the dollar. Each of the three coins stay normal today because of the amount struck. Course pieces were in copper nickel; Congress likewise commanded 45,000,000 section silver pieces be struck for gatherers. The Mint sold over portion of the part-silver coins before liquefying the rest of pulling back them from deal in 1986. 

Memorial coins had been struck for various occasions and commemorations by the United States Mint since 1892. Associations would get Congress to approve a coin and would be permitted to purchase up the issue, pitching it to people in general including some built-in costs. The last issue among these commemoratives, half dollars respecting Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver were struck over various years, and were ended in 1954. Initially valued at $3.50, they were over and over limited; many couldn't be sold at a higher cost than expected and entered course. The advertiser of these issues, S.J. Phillips, misused the conveyance and lost $140,000. The negative exposure caused the Department of the Treasury, of which the Mint is a section, to restrict consequent memorial coin recommendations, and until the 1970s, Congress passed none. 

In 1966, Congress built up the American Revolutionary Bicentennial Commission (ARBC) to plan and facilitate exercises associated with the 1976 bicentennial of American Independence ("the Bicentennial"). In February 1970, the ARBC set up a Coins and Medals Advisory Committee. The board's underlying report, in July 1970, required the creation of a memorial half dollar for the Bicentennial. In December 1970, the advisory group called for unique plans for all categories of US coinage for the Bicentennial; the ARBC embraced this position the next month. The Treasury, be that as it may, contradicted the change, following its longstanding position against memorial coins. A few recommendations for Bicentennial coins were presented in Congress in 1971 and 1972, yet did not pass. 

Mint Director Mary Brooks had gone to the Advisory Committee gatherings. At one gathering, she bolstered having a 1776â 1976 twofold date on circling coins to stamp the commemoration in 1976, albeit obliging two dates on the front would include creation troubles. Be that as it may, in a paper talk with she named changing the six circling coins (penny through dollar) "a fiasco". She felt if any Bicentennial coin was issued, it ought to be non-circling, maybe a half penny or a gold piece. Creeks trusted that such a coin would not upset the Mint in the generation of coins for dissemination. Amid 1972, in any case, she withdrew from that position, and before the year's over had induced Treasury Secretary George Shultz to help a Bicentennial coin bill. 

In January 1973, Texas Representative Richard C. White presented enactment for memorial dollars and half dollars. Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield likewise advanced a bill, requiring a $25 gold piece. On March 2, 1973, the Treasury declared its help for Bicentennial coin enactment for configuration changes to the inverts of the circling dollars and half dollars, and sent proposed enactment to Congress three days after the fact. Hearings before a subcommittee in the House of Representatives were hung on May 2, 1973. Creeks affirmed, supporting the constrained overhaul in the bill, however contradicting a progressively broad coin update. Independently from the Bicentennial issue, she requested specialist to strike US coins at the West Point Bullion Depository, where space was accessible to introduce more seasoned coinage presses. Rivulets deplored the Hatfield proposition, expressing that the coin would need to be .667 unadulterated or less to abstain from accumulating. 

Because of the hearings, a few extra bills were presented, and extra hearings were held before a Senate subcommittee on June 6. Creeks affirmed once more, and reacting to analysis that just the two least prevalent sections were to be changed, shown her help for a Bicentennial quarter too. On June 13, a bill, S. 1141 which accommodated a flowing Bicentennial quarter, half dollar and dollar, gave authorization for mint pieces to be struck at West Point and considered 40% silver clad renditions of the new currencies for gatherers was accounted for positively by the Senate Banking Committee. It passed the Senate on July 13. Be that as it may, corrections approving US residents to possess gold, and to execute the Hatfield proposition were joined to the bill. A comparative bill passed the House of Representatives on September 12, varying from the Senate bill in coming up short on any arrangement identifying with gold, and in not approving silver forms of the new coins. 

Individuals from the two houses met in a meeting board of trustees on September 19 out of a session portrayed by spectators as "genuinely hot and overwhelming". The subsequent bill had no gold arrangements, yet approved changes to the switches of the quarter, half dollar and dollar for the Bicentennial. The front-sides of the three coins would not change, however would bear the twofold date 1776â 1976. By the terms of the resolution, all coins stamped to be issued after July 4, 1975 and before January 1, 1977 would bear the Bicentennial dates and structures. Congress guided the Mint to strike 45,000,000 silver clad coins (that is, 15,000,000 sets), and the Mint got the mentioned specialist to strike coins at West Point. Dissemination quarters, half dollars and dollars would keep on being of copper nickel clung to an interior layer of copper, that is, copper nickel clad. The altered bill passed the two places of Congress on October 4, 1973, and the bill was marked into law by President Richard Nixon on October 18. Hatfield's measure, alongside comparable enactment from different representatives, was reintroduced in 1975, however kicked the bucket in board of trustees, as did enactment looking for a Bicentennial two-penny piece and a bill looking for a coin respecting Abigail Adams and Susan B. Anthony. The additional creation at West Point was vital to beating a deficiency of pennies in 1974, and allowed the Mint more noteworthy adaptability as it equipped to strike the Bicentennial pieces. 

On October 23, 1973, the Department of the Treasury declared a challenge for the three invert plans. Any US resident could submit one illustration, or photo of a mortar show in distance across. Entries were to incorporate the legend "". Treasury Secretary Shultz, instructed by a board with respect to judges, would choose which configuration would be utilized for which sectionâthe engraving would be changed to and for the higher groups. Also, the inverts were to shoulder the name of the nation and the adage "", as required by law. 

At Director Brooks' solicitation, the National Sculpture Society chose the five judges for the challenge. The judges were society President Robert Weinman (child of Adolph Weinman, who had planned the Mercury dime and Walking Liberty half dollar), Connecticut stone worker Adlai S. Hardin, previous Mint Chief Engraver Gilroy Roberts, Julius Lauth of the Medallic Art Company, and Elvira Clain-Stefanelli, guardian in the Division of Numismatics, Smithsonian Institution. 

The due date was initially December 14, 1973, however was reached out to January 9, 1974 as a result of the vitality emergency and Christmas mail delays. Streams ventured out more than to promote the challenge. By the due date, the Mint had gotten 15,000 request and 884Â entries. Individuals from the board and any individual utilized by the US government as a stone carver were ineligible to enter. The prize for every one of the three victors was $5,000. The judging was initially expected to occur at West Point; with the deferral, it occurred rather at the Philadelphia Mint. 

From the sections, the judges chosen twelve semifinalist plans; the stone carver presenting each got a prize of $750. The contenders were to put their work on mortar models, if that had not as of now been done, and were offered help with making the models. 

The twelve outstanding plans were discharged by the Treasury for open remark in mid 1974. Two of the proposed coins highlighted cruising ships, two included Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the Declaration of Independence was marked, and three portrayed the moon or lunar shuttle. Another delineated the Liberty Bell superimposed on a nuclear image. As indicated by numismatist Michael Marotta in his 2001 article on the Bicentennial coins, "the numismatic network's response to the passages was unsurprising: everybody whined by composing letters to the editorial manager". 

From the twelve, the judges chosen six finalists for audit by the National Bicentennial Coin Design Competition Committee, comprising of Brooks, Representative Wright Patman, Senator John Sparkman, Commission of Fine Arts Secretary Charles H. Atherton and Eric P. Newman, executive of the ARBC's coins and decorations warning board of trustees. Subsequent to accepting the advisory group's proposals, Secretary Shultz chose the champs and on March 6, 1974, Brooks went on the "Today" show to report them. Jack L. Ahr's structure highlighting a pilgrim drummer, with a light of triumph encompassed by thirteen stars (speaking to the first states) was chosen for the quarter. Seth Huntington's picture of Independence Hall was chosen for the half dollar while Dennis R. Williams' superimposition of the Liberty Bell against the moon was effective for the dollar. Ahr possessed a business craftsmanship firm and Huntington was head craftsman for Brown and Bigelow, a Minneapolis distributing firm. Williams, at age 21 the most youthful individual to plan a US coin, was a craftsmanship understudy who had initially made his structure for a class task. No change would be made to the front-sides of the coins, with the exception of the twofold dating. 

Ahr was blamed for duplicating his drummer from a 1973 stamp by the stamp's originator, William A. Smith; he denied it. As indicated by numismatic student of history Walter Breen, "both clearly get from Archibald Willard's 1876 painting "Soul of '76"," a work of art which numismatic creator David L. Ganz proposes that both without a doubt saw at some point in their lives. Ahr, nonetheless, expressed that his child had been the model for the drummer. Rivulets, in a letter to Smith, expressed that the plan for the quarter was "adequately unique" to inspire the National Sculpture Society. Weinman later belittled the triumphant structures: 

I truly don't think what we got was an extraordinary deal. Nothing we chose was a genuine champ that I'd battle to the demise for. As far as what we needed to work with, however, I figure we did as well as could be expected. 

On April 24, 1974, the three winning planners were conveyed to Washington, D.C. After a voyage through the White House and gatherings with the congressional boards of trustees which considered the coin charges, they went to the Treasury Building and got their $5,000 checks from the new Treasury Secretary, William E. Simon, who playfully inquired as to whether they needed to put their honors in reserve funds securities. 

Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro rolled out minor improvements to each of the three switch plans. Gasparro improved the quarter configuration, adjusted the drum for realness, changed the lettering and altered the demeanor on the drummer's face. He rolled out slight improvements to Independence Hall on the half dollar and changed the lettering on the dollar to encourage the metal stream amid stepping and requested that the planner fix the base edge of the Liberty Bell. Ahr later expressed that he would have enjoyed more opportunity to conclude his structure, wishing to illuminate the highlights of the drummer's face. The initials of the planner were added to the structure by the Mint. Every one of the three concurred that Gasparro's progressions improved their structures. 

On August 12, 1974, the three creators were at the Philadelphia Mint, where they formally worked the presses to strike the primary coins bearing their structures. These models were shown under furnished watchman at the American Numismatic Association tradition in Florida the following day. They vary from all other Bicentennial coins in that they were struck in silver confirmation without mint imprint; other silver verification coins bear a "S" mint imprint as struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (as the San Francisco Mint was then known). Coins struck at Denver bear a "D" on the front-side; pieces coming up short on a mint imprint were struck at Philadelphia. Sets of these models were displayed to President Gerald Ford, Counselor to the President Anne Armstrong and Director John Warner of the American Revolutionary Bicentennial Administration (the successor to the ARBC). All other first strikes were softened, with duplicates not in any case kept for the National Numismatic Collection. 

The Mint trusted that on the off chance that it was required to strike 1975 quarters, half dollars and dollars, insufficient could be struck before it needed to start the Bicentennial issues to keep the 1975 pieces from turning into authority's things. This gambled coin deficiencies when the Mint was looking to assemble an overflow of quarters. Mint authorities came back to Congress to look for changing enactment. President Ford marked a bill on December 26, 1974 that rolled out a few noncontroversial improvements to law, including arrangements to enable the Mint to continue striking 1974-dated pieces until it started striking the Bicentennial coins. By terms of the correcting enactment, the dedicatory coins couldn't be issued until after July 4, 1975. 

On November 15, 1974, the Mint started taking requests for the silver clad pieces, at a cost of $15 for evidence sets and $9 for uncirculated, with a due date for requests of January 31, 1975. Uncirculated coins resemble those recently discharged into dissemination; evidence coins have a mirror wrap up. Purchasers were at first restricted to five sets for each individual. On January 19, 1975, Brooks declared that the silver evidence set cost was sliced to $12, and as far as possible was postponed. Purchasers who had paid the more expensive rate were sent discounts with a money order. Creeks expressed that the value decrease was a direct result of generation efficiencies, the advantage of which she wished to go along to people in general. Numismatic feature writer Ed Reiter noted, however, that the decrease came in the midst of challenges from the numismatic network that the cost was excessively high. Coin vendor Herby Skelton recommended in 1977 that the underlying high cost for the sets pursued by the decrease, together with the extensive mintage of silver sets made the open suspicious and added to slacking deals. On August 20, 1975, the cost for the uncirculated silver sets was diminished to $7 when mass buys of at least 50 were made. A bank in Taiwan requested 250,000Â sets at this cost. 

The primary Bicentennial coins to be delivered that were planned for the open were dollars, struck amid February 1975. The first for gatherers were struck at San Francisco on April 23, 1975. The San Francisco Assay Office struck the 45,000,000 silver coins first, delivering eleven million sets in uncirculated and four million in evidence, at that point started the base metal pieces. When striking started, the Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinguishably, an issue not seen with the silver pieces. The Mint adjusted the passes on; the most recognizable change is that the amended issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have smaller, more keen lettering on the invert. Every single silver piece (struck just at San Francisco) are Type I; each of the three mints struck both Type I and Type II copper nickel pieces. All dollars incorporated into 1975 proof sets are Type I; each one of those incorporated into 1976 proof sets are Type II. Bicentennial currencies for gatherers were not conveyed until after July 4, 1975. The Bicentennial pieces, in base metal, were incorporated into 1975 proof sets and mint sets together with 1975-dated pennies, nickels and dimes. 

The new coins initially entered course on July 7, 1975, when the half dollar was discharged related to functions in Minneapolis, Huntington's main residence. The quarter followed in September and the dollar in October, each additionally with functions to stamp the issuance. The pieces were struck in numbers surpassing those required for course; a Mint representative expressed, "The hypothesis in striking them was to have enough accessible so however many Americans as could reasonably be expected would have a chance to have a coinage celebration of the Bicentennial year. They're momentos." 

In 1977, the Mint came back to the old invert plans for the quarter, half dollar and dollar. Deals by mid-1977 had dropped off extensively, to maybe 300 sets every week, with one Mint authority depicting the deals against the huge unsold amounts as "a small detail within a bigger landscape". By 1979, the Mint foreseen an inevitable sellout for the silver verification set, however conceded that with huge amounts unsold, there was no reasonable probability of selling all uncirculated silver sets. On September 17, 1979, looked with a spike in silver costs, Mint Director Stella B. Hackel declared that the sets were being expelled from deal. They were come back to deal in August 1980, at expanded costs of $20 in confirmation and $15 in uncirculated. In September 1981, the Mint, refering to a decrease in the cost of silver, scaled down the cost of the sets to $15 in verification and $12 in uncirculated. A point of confinement of 100 sets for each individual was determined to evidence deals, with none on uncirculated. An expansive number of sets were liquefied by the administration in 1982. Reagan organization Mint Director Donna Pope later expressed, 

"Offers of 1776â 1976 standard issue Bicentennial coins continued forever, apparently until the end of time." On December 31, 1986, the staying Bicentennial uncirculated silver sets were expelled from deal. At the time, it was declared that confirmation sets had effectively sold out when coins went off deal. Nonetheless, Marotta, writing in 2001, expressed that when deals stopped, 400,000 proof sets and 200,000 uncirculated sets stayed in stock. 

Because of the expansive amounts struck, Bicentennial coins stay cheap. A lot of three silver coins contains .5381 troy ounces of the valuable metal. In a 1996 factual investigation, T.V. Buttrey found that around 750,000,000 of the dissemination quarters, in excess of a third, had been stored and did not course. Coin seller Marcel Sassola recommended in 1977 of the silver sets, "There were simply too many sold, and I figure it will require a long investment before they have any genuine esteem. Possibly by the Tricentennial."
