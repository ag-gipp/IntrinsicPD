Yukon Quest 

The Yukon Quest 1,000-mile International Sled Dog Race, or essentially Yukon Quest, is a sled hound race run each February between Fairbanks, Alaska, and Whitehorse, Yukon. Due to the unforgiving winter conditions, troublesome trail, and the constrained help that contenders are permitted, it is considered the "most troublesome sled hound race on the planet", or even the "hardest race on the planet"â "significantly harder, more specific and less consideration looking for than the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race." The originator imagined it as "a race so rough that just idealists would take an interest." 

In the challenge, first keep running in 1984, a canine group pioneer (called a musher) and a group of 6 to 14Â dogs race for 10 to 20Â days. The course pursues the course of the memorable 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, mail conveyance, and transportation courses between Fairbanks, Dawson City, and Whitehorse. Mushers pack up to of hardware and arrangements for themselves and their mutts to get by between checkpoints. Every musher must depend on a solitary sled for the whole run, versus three in the Iditarod. 

Ten checkpoints and four canine drops, some more than separated, lie along the trail. Veterinarians are available at each to guarantee the wellbeing and welfare of the puppies, give counsel, and give veterinary consideration to dropped hounds; together with the race marshal or a race judge, they may expel a pooch or group from the race for therapeutic or different reasons. There are just nine checkpoints for rest, versus 22 in the Iditarod. Mushers are allowed to leave hounds at checkpoints and pooch drops, however not to supplant them. Sleds may not be supplanted (without punishment) and mushers can't acknowledge assistance from non-racers aside from at Dawson City, the midway imprint. 

The course keeps running on solidified streams, more than four mountain ranges, and through secluded northern towns. Racers spread or more. Temperatures generally drop as low as , and winds can reach at higher rises. Since it starts a month sooner than the Iditarod, the Quest is a colder race, and is kept running on shorter sunlight based days and through longer, darker evenings. Sonny Lindner won the debut race in 1984 from a field of 26Â teams. The quickest run occurred in 2010, when Hans Gatt completed after 26Â minutes. The 2012 challenge had the nearest one-two completion, as Hugh Neff beat Allen Moore by twenty-six seconds. 

In 2005, Lance Mackey turned into the principal Yukon Quest new kid on the block to win the race, an accomplishment that was rehashed by 2011's boss, Dallas Seavey. In 2007, Mackey turned into the first to win both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod, an accomplishment he rehashed the next year. The longest race time was in 1988, when Ty Halvorson took 20Â days, 8Â hours, and 29Â minutes to wrap up. In 2000, Aliy Zirkle turned into the main lady to win the race, in 10Â days, 22Â hours, and 57Â minutes. Yukon Quest International, which runs the Yukon Quest sled hound race, likewise runs two shorter races: the Junior Quest and the Yukon Quest 300 (beforehand the Yukon Quest 250). 

The thought for the Yukon Quest began in April 1983 amid a saloon discourse among four Alaskans: LeRoy Shank, Roger Williams, Ron Rosser, and William "Willy" Lipps. The four proposed a thousand-mile sled hound race from Fairbanks, Alaska to Whitehorse, Yukon, to praise the Klondike Gold Rush-period mail and transportation courses between the two. They despised the numerous checkpoints and phases of the Iditarod Sled Dog Race and imagined a continuance race in which racers would depend on themselves and survival would be as vital as speed. "We needed all the more a Bush encounter, a race that would put a little woodsmanship into it", Shank said at the race's 25th commemoration. 

This remained an unclear arrangement until August 1983, when the principal open hierarchical gatherings occurred. Raising money started, and the begin date for the race was hopefully pushed ahead from February 1985 to February 25, 1984. The passage charge for the principal race was $500, and Murray Clayton of Haines, Alaska turned into the primary individual to enter when he paid his expense in October 1983. In December 1983, the race was formally named the Yukon Quest. Two additional long periods of arranging pursued, and a team of volunteers was sorted out to staff the checkpoints and spot trail markers. On February 25, 1984, 26Â racers left Fairbanks for Whitehorse. Each group was constrained to a limit of 12 mutts, and racers needed to complete with no less than nine. They additionally needed to pull of nourishment per hound ( aggregate) to cover the long separations between checkpoints. 

Various issues happened in the principal race. The main mushers needed to break trail in light of the fact that the snowmobile proposed for the errand separated. Trail markers regularly were missing or lost, and no arrangements had been made for racers in Dawson City until coordinator Roger Williams flew there not long after the race started. After Dawson City, mushers had their mutts and sleds trucked to maintain a strategic distance from an area of snowless trail, at that point needed to manage open areas of the Yukon River close Whitehorse due to better than expected temperatures. The inevitable victor of the debut race, Sonny Lindner, was welcomed with little display on his landing. On the race's 25th commemoration, he reviewed, "I think it was 90Â percent (outdoors) trip and perhaps a smidgen of dashing." 

After the debut race, coordinators improved the checking of the trail for the primary challenge held in the Whitehorseâ Fairbanks course. Musher Bill Cotter stated, "The trail was nice to the point that it was hard to keep from going excessively quick." The race developed in ubiquity throughout the following couple of years. In 1988 and again in 1989, 47 mushers entered. In 1989, 31 finished the raceâthe most that have ever completed it. In 1990, Connie and Terri Frerichs turned into the first (thus far just) mother and little girl to contend in a similar Yukon Quest: Terri completed 21st, beating her mom (22nd) by 26Â minutes. The 1991 race saw eight groups pull back in the primary quarter as a result of an episode of a canine malady called the "Healy Virus". Thirty-five additional mutts were sickened before the spread of the infection was ended by colder climate part of the way through the race. In 1992, unseasonable warmth caused issues in the main portion of the race, and the second was influenced by harsh virus. The head veterinarian of that race, Jeannie Olson, was supplanted after she offered canine needle therapy to a few mushers. In spite of the fact that not then taboo by any standard, this abused equivalent treatment rules since she didn't offer the treatment to each musher. Toward the finish of that race, George Cook turned into the principal musher since 1984 to complete shy of Whitehorse when untamed water on the Yukon River kept him from proceeding. Since he didn't stop, race authorities gave him the Red Lantern Award. 

Following the 1992 race, discussion ejected when the Alaska governing body of Yukon Quest International educated the Yukon board that they were thinking about dropping the Yukon half of the Quest since Yukon authorities did not meet gathering pledges objectives. The Frozen North authorities additionally trusted it is simpler to deal with an Alaska-just race. An emergency was turned away when the Yukon top managerial staff consented to collect more cash and the opposite sides framed a joint top managerial staff. The 1993 race was kept running of course, yet Jeff Mann had a more exciting race than most. At the point when a moose assaulted his pooch group, he was compelled to murder it with a hatchet, at that point butcher it as indicated by Quest rules. Afterward, he was punished 90Â minutes for acquiring a journalist's head light. At long last, after the finish of the race, he was fined a large portion of his rewards when his canines tried positive for ibuprofen. 

In the 1994 race, Alaskan Bruce Cosgrove was denied section by Canadian traditions authorities in the pre-race check process, the main time a musher has been denied passage into either Canada or Alaska. Cosgrove began the race, however quit before the fringe. Following the race, discussion again ejected when Alaska Yukon Quest authorities reported they would singularly dispose of Whitehorse from the Yukon Quest and run a less expensive Fairbanks-to-Dawson City race. Individuals from the Yukon Quest association rebelled against this and casted a ballot to expel the board individuals who had proposed it. 

The 1995 race included 22 mushers, of whom 13 wrapped up. Spending issues made the primary prize drop by 25% to $15,000, adding to the low support. This issue was fixed for the 1996 race, with an in front of the rest of the competition prize of $25,000. The 1997 race was won by Rick Mackey, sibling of later Quest champ Lance Mackey; the two are the main sibling winning pair in Quest history. Following the 1997 race, money related inconveniences again emerged, this time on the Alaska side. Canadian coordinators verified global sponsorship for the 1998 race, and when they would not give this sponsorship cash a chance to be utilized to pay obligations amassed in Alaska, individuals from the Alaska board took steps to have a different challenge. At last, the Alaska board individuals were compelled to leave, and an arrangement was worked out between the opposite sides. 

The 1998 race was kept running on calendar and had 38 participants. The 1999 race was won by Alaska Native Ramy Brooks, who crushed veterinarian Mark May by 10Â minutes. In 2000, Aliy Zirkle turned into the primary lady to win the Yukon Quest in the wake of taking 10Â days, 22Â hours, and 57Â minutes to trek the . Likewise in 2000, Yukon Quest International included two races: the Quest 250 (today the Quest 300) and the Junior Quest (both depicted beneath). Rivals in each have proceeded to take an interest in the Yukon Quest. The first of these graduated mushers contended in the 2001 race, won by Tim Osmar. 

In 2002, the Yukon Quest was won by Hans Gatt, an Austrian-brought into the world inhabitant of British Columbia and the principal European to win. This was the first of three continuous successes, making him the initial three-time victor. In 2003, Gatt's second win was truncated by an absence of snow close Whitehorse. Unseasonable warmth constrained coordinators to truck mushers and their canine groups to Braeburn before proceeding with what turned into a challenge. The 2004 race saw 31Â mushers begin the race and 20 complete, a drop-out rate of 35%. Amid the primary 24Â years of the challenge, there were 513Â finishers. In spite of the fact that 90 additional mushers endeavored the race in the main 12Â years than in the following dozen runnings, there is little contrast in the rate that did not complete (35% in 1984â 1995; 33% in 1996â 2007). 

In 2005, first-time member Lance Mackey broke Hans Gatt's three-win streak. Mackey completed in 11Â days, 32Â seconds. The triumph was the first of four straight successes by Mackey, who holds the record for most back to back successes and is additionally the main four-time victor. Amid Mackey's second win, a furious tempest on Eagle Summit caused a whiteout that constrained seven mushers and puppy groups to be emptied by helicopter. Halfway due to the tempest, just 11 completed the 2006 raceâthe least ever. The finishers additionally persevered through a bizarre course: since snow was rare close Whitehorse, they turned around and completed in Dawson City in the wake of dashing the . In 2007, three canines were slaughtered in inconsequential episodes, however Mackey tied Gatt's record of three back to back successes. After one month, Mackey turned into the main individual to win both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod around the same time. Mackey's fourth win came amid the 2008 race, the principal Yukon Quest to finish in Whitehorse since 2003. 

In light of the late 2000s subsidence, the 2009 Yukon Quest tote was diminished to $151,000 from an arranged aggregate of $200,000. Therefore, the primary prize was diminished to $30,000 from the arranged $35,000. Halfway along these lines, Mackey pulled back before the race, making it simpler for a newcomer to win. In the nearest oneâ two completion, German Sebastian Schnuelle finished the race quicker than anybody previously, completing that year's trek in 9Â days, 23Â hours, and 20Â minutes. He was only four minutes in front of Hugh Neff. 

Following the 2009 race, authorities chose to propel the challenge's begin date by multi week to all the more likely oblige mushers additionally taking an interest in the Iditarod. The 2010 race began in Fairbanks on February 6, 2010, and the encouraging start date was kept for the 2011 challenge. Hans Gatt won the 2010 race with the quickest completion in Yukon Quest history: 26Â minutes. That race was set apart by great climate, and couple of mushers dropped out. In 2011, conditions came back to typical, as brutal tempests impacted the trail and mushers amid the second 50% of the race. Just 13 of the 25 contenders finished the race, tying the record for least finishers. In 2013, poor trail conditions over American Summit constrained the Dawson to Eagle area of the course to be rerouted over the Yukon River. 

The course of the race differs marginally from year to year in light of ice conditions on the Yukon River, snowfall, and different components. The length of the course has likewise changed, going from in the climate abbreviated 2003 race to in 1998. In even-numbered years, the race begins in Fairbanks and finishes in Whitehorse. In odd-numbered years, the begin and end goals switch. 

The course pursues the Yukon River for quite a bit of its course and goes more than four mountains: King Solomon's Dome, Eagle Summit, American Summit, and Rosebud Summit. Its length is proportional to the separation among England and Africa, and the separation between certain checkpoints is the expansiveness of Ireland. Racers suffer ice, snow, and extraordinary virus. Untamed life is basic on the trail, and members in some cases face difficulties from moose and wolves. Due to the cruel conditions, the Yukon Quest has been known as the "most troublesome sled hound race on the planet" and the "hardest race on the planet". 

In view of the outrageous trouble of the challenge, a few phases of readiness are required. The first is the sustenance drop, when mushers and race authorities position stores of nourishment and supplies at race checkpoints. This is vital on the grounds that mushers may just utilize their provisions along the course, mirroring the Gold Rush time, when hound trains would resupply at focuses along the trail. Multi week after the nourishment drop, all canines taking an interest in the race experience a fundamental veterinarian investigation to guarantee they are sound enough to race 1,000Â miles in subarctic conditions. The last phase of formal readiness is two days before the race, when mushers pick their beginning request from a cap. 

The customary beginning line is in Whitehorse on First Avenue, close to the previous White Pass and Yukon Route train station, which today houses the Canadian workplaces of Yukon Quest International. Soon after leaving the beginning line, racers pursue the solidified Yukon River north away. Intersection onto the Takhini River, mushers tail it north to the Klondike-time Overland Trail. Racers take the trail to Braeburn Lodge, the main checkpoint. 

This trail section is about long. The landscape comprises of little slopes and successive solidified streams and lakes. At the point when the race keeps running from Fairbanks to Whitehorse, the Braeburn checkpoint is the site of a required eight-hour stop to guarantee the strength of mushers' puppies before the last stage. In odd years, mushers must take a four-hour rest here or at Carmacks. The three moment begin time distinction is balanced here. In even years, mushers must take an eight (8) hour rest here before proceeding for the remainder of the race. 

In the main leg of this, mushers must make a trip from Bareburn to Carmacks which is . In odd years, mushers have the alternative of taking their four-hour rest here or at Bareburn. The three moment distinction begin time is likewise balanced if the musher takes their four-hour rest here. 

Leaving Braeburn, contenders cross the Klondike Highway and continue east for going to Coghlan Lake. From that point they turn north, at that point northwest, and travel along a chain of lakes that extends for about . They at that point enter an infamous stretch of intensely forested slopes nicknamed "Pinball Alley" for the manner in which the harsh landscape bobs sleds into trees, rocks, and different obstructions. Trees are so scarred from rehashed sled impacts that they have lost their bark on one side. In 1998, racer Brenda Mackey was shocked around such a great amount by the unpleasant trail that her sled ended up wedged between two trees, driving her to chop one down to proceed. 

After Pinball Alley, racers quickly mush along the Yukon River before climbing the riverbank to the Carmacks checkpoint. They at that point pursue a street for about and turn onto a firebreak trail. In the wake of leaving the trail, they traverse the Yukon River to McCabe Creek, the main puppy drop on the Whitehorseâ Fairbanks course. Leaving McCabe Creek, the race trail parallels a garage and the Klondike Highway for a few miles before swinging north to cross the Pelly Burn, a zone seared by a rapidly spreading fire in 1995. Since the flame annihilated a great part of the backwoods in the region, this segment of the trail has couple of hindrances and is viewed as quick. From the McCabe Creek site it is going to Pelly Crossing. 

The stretch between Pelly Crossing and Dawson City is the best separation between checkpoints of any sled hound rivalry on the planet. Between the two destinations are of open trail, checked just by a canine drop at Scroggie Creek, a surrendered gold-mining site initiated just amid the Yukon Quest. 

From Pelly Crossing, mushers travel west on the solidified Pelly River, or on a street that parallels the stream if ice conditions are poor. At Stepping Stone, in no time before the Pelly and Yukon waterways meet, they can rest at a cordiality stop before turning north. From Stepping Stone to Scroggie Creek the trail comprises of a mining street or "feline" street, named for the Caterpillar followed mining vehicles that utilization it. Before coordinators composed calendars with the mining hardware administrators, racers frequently needed to fight with overwhelming apparatus hindering the trail or transforming it into a sloppy way. The Scroggie Creek hound drop is at the conversion of the Stewart River and Scroggie Creek. 

After Scroggie Creek, the trail changes from a westerly course to straightforwardly north. Now, mushers enter the gold-mining region encompassing Dawson City. From the Stewart River contiguous Scroggie, the trail climbs, crossing the Yukon Territory's Black Hills. from Dawson City and from Scroggie Creek, it crosses the Indian River, and mushers start the move to King Solomon's Dome, the most astounding point () on the trail. The trail climbs more bit by bit in the Whitehorseâ Fairbanks course than the other way, where mushers need to persevere through a few curves. At the point when mushers begin in Whitehorse, they as of now have increased a few thousand feet from the rising into the Black Hills, including a move over Eureka Dome. The primary challenges come amid the plunge from King Solomon's Dome to Bonanza Creek, the epicenter of the Klondike Gold Rush. In the wake of achieving the rivulet, mushers string through a territory of mining waste and pursue the Klondike River to Dawson City, the midpoint of the race. They are required to rest for 36Â hours in Dawson City as a midway rest. 

The separation from Dawson City to Eagle, the principal checkpoint in Alaska for the Whitehorseâ Fairbanks course, is . Mushers must rest for four hours in Eagle. 

Racers leave Dawson City on the Yukon River and tail it for going to the Fortymile River cordiality stop. The waterway's name originates from its separation from Fort Reliance, a deserted exchanging post built up in 1874. From the cordiality stop, mushers travel southwest on the Fortymile River in what is one of the coldest segments of the race, as a result of virus air sinking to the base of the waterway valley. The trail on the stream crosses the Alaskaâ Canada outskirt, observable simply because of the fringe vista, a segment of land cleared of all foliage. In the blink of an eye past the outskirt, the stream turns northwest, and mushers leave its solidified surface when it meets the Taylor Highway, a street shut down to car traffic amid the winter. As the trail pursues the expressway for conditions are frequently dangerous, with high breezes and floating snow that can darken trail markers. In the wake of climbing the American Summit, the trail bit by bit plummets to Eagle, on the banks of the Yukon River. 

The course from Eagle to Central covers a separation of . In winter, Eagle is struck by high breezes and floating snow channeled through the town by close-by Eagle Bluff, which remains over the Yukon River. Since it is the main stop in the United States, contenders are welcomed at Eagle by a United States Department of Homeland Security official who checks international IDs and section records. 

In the wake of leaving Eagle, mushers travel northwest for on the Yukon River, aside from a couple of short portages. Amid this stretch, two cordiality stops are accessible. The first is from Eagle at Trout Creek. The following is Biederman's Cabin, the previous home of Charlie Biederman, one of the last individuals to convey mail by sled hound. (The last sled hound mail course was dropped in 1963, and Biederman's sled hangs in the National Postal Museum.) A puppy drop site is situated from Biederman's Cabin at Slaven's Cabin, a memorable site worked by the National Park Service. Some past Slaven's Cabin mushers touch base in Circle, so named in light of the fact that its authors trusted it was on the Arctic Circle. (Circle is in reality about south of that line.) 

From Circle, it is to the checkpoint in Central. Mushers pursue Birch Creek south until just before Circle Hot Springs. This territory, alongside the Fortymile stretch, is considered among the coldest on the trail, and mushers are encouraged to get ready for temperatures. Turning west, they travel through solidified bogs before achieving the Steese Roadhouse checkpoint in Central. In Central amid even years, mushers have the choice of taking their four-hour rest here or at Mile 101. In the event that they decide to, the three moment begin distinction will be subtracted from their rest time. 

From Central to the last (or first, in the Fairbanksâ Whitehorse course) checkpoint in Two Rivers is . In spite of the near closeness of the checkpoints and the area of a pooch drop between them, this is viewed as the most troublesome stretch of puppy sled trail on the planet. Now, mushers must ascend the two steepest and most troublesome mountains on the trail: Eagle Summit and Rosebud Summit. 

Subsequent to leaving Central, mushers head west, paralleling the Steese Highway, which interfaces Central and Circle with Fairbanks. The trail goes through solidified marshes, mining regions, and firebreaks for about . Mushers at that point experience the Steese Highway for a second time before intersection a few streams to start the climb of Eagle Summit. They in the end move over the tree line and are presented to the breeze as they proceed with upward. The climate on Eagle Summit is cruel as this is an assembly zone between the Yukon Flats toward the north and the low ground of the Tanana Valley toward the south. A differential in the climate inside the two valleys causes high breezes and precipitation when there is dampness in the environment. The last couple of hundred yards of the ascension comprises of a 30-degree incline regularly scoured to uncovered shake and tundra by the savage breeze. The intersection point itself is a symmetrical seat, with two pinnacles of comparable stature isolated by . The south side of Eagle Summit isn't as steep, and mushers for the most part have a simpler time achieving the checkpoint at Mile 101. While diving the lofty northern incline of Eagle Summit on the Fairbanksâ Whitehorse course, numerous mushers enclose their sled sprinters by chains to expand grating and moderate the dive. 

The Mile 101 checkpoint is a lodge at mile marker 101 (the separation from Fairbanks) on the Steese Highway. At Mile 101, mushers have the alternative of taking their four-hour rest amid even years. They can likewise take the rest at Central amid even years. Once more, the three moment begin contrast will be subtracted from the race if the musher wants to take their rest here. The lodge gives mushers the open door for a brief rest between Eagle Summit and Rosebud Summit. The rising of Rosebud Summit starts about south of the puppy drop. It comprises of a slow move of pursued by a lofty drop into the valley that contains the north fork of the Chena River. The drop likewise brings mushers once again into forested territory. The trail at that point parallels a street for about before entering the last checkpoint at Twin Bears Campground close to Two Rivers. 

Two Rivers is the last checkpoint in the Whitehorseâ Fairbanks course. Mushers are required to rest no less than eight hours in Two Rivers in odd years to guarantee the soundness of their pooches amid the last leg of the race. The territory in this stretch is among the most effortless on the trail, with delicately moving slopes and backwoods which continuously change into a urban scene as racers approach Fairbanks. The best test for racers in the Two Rivers zone is recognizing the Yukon Quest trail from other sled hound trails, a considerable lot of which have comparative markings. Mushers have every so often been tricked by these markings and taken wrong turns. 

Past Two Rivers, the trail achieves the Chena River northwest of Fairbanks. This is the last stretch, and mushers utilize the waterway to enter Fairbanks and achieve the end goal, which is on the stream itself amidst downtown Fairbanks. Notwithstanding the planning of the completion, a few thousand observers normally accumulate to watch the primary musher cross the end goal. 

The 1984 course was somewhat not the same as today's. It had only one non-checkpoint hound drop, at the Mile 101 area, and avoided American Summit, Pelly Junction, and Braeburn. Rather than going through Braeburn, mushers traversed Lake Laberge for among Whitehorse and Minto. The debut race additionally incorporated a checkpoint at Chena Hot Springs Resort close Fairbanks. This site was moved to close-by Angel Creek after mushers griped that the hot springs dissolved adjacent snow, making their canines become wetâan outrageous risk in sub-frigid temperatures. Two extra puppy drops were included for the 1994 race: Biederman's Cabin (since supplanted by Slaven's Cabin) and McCabe Creek. In 1995, the Whitehorse end of the trail was moved far from Lake Laberge to close to the Takhini River. Extra changes that year incorporated the rerouting of the trail around the southern and eastern sides of King Solomon's Dome south of Dawson City and the presentation of the Scroggie Creek hound drop site on the shore of the Stewart River. 

In 1996, the trail was rerouted through Pelly Crossing and a checkpoint was included there, and the Lake Laberge extend was supplanted by a course through Braeburn and along the Dawson-Whitehorse Overland Trail. In 1997, mushers were directed through the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project and to the Alaska town of North Pole before proceeding to Fairbanks. The North Pole circle was expelled before the 2009 race, and mushers were coordinated through Two Rivers. Beginning in the 2010 race, the Mile 101 area was overhauled from a canine drop to an undeniable checkpoint. In the previous a few races, the Two Rivers checkpoint has changed areas every year: from a hotel to a campground, and afterward to a rock pit in 2011. 

The Yukon Quest trail is in the subarctic atmosphere run. In Fairbanks, the normal February temperature is , yet isn't phenomenal, and temperatures have dropped to . A normal of snow falls in February, with normal snowpack profundity of . 

Outside the protected urban regions of Fairbanks, Whitehorse, and Dawson City, temperatures and snowfall are regularly increasingly extraordinary. Amid the 2008 race, contenders began in temperatures in Fairbanks and after that confronted breezes of on the trail, bringing about serious breeze chills. At higher heights, for example, the intersections of Rosebud and Eagle summits, whiteout tempests are normal. In the 2006 race, 12 groups were struck by an enormous tempest that in the long run caused the clearing of seven groups by helicopter. In 2009, mushers suffered ends up to , blowing snow, and below zero temperatures on Eagle Summit, where conditions had been far more atrocious in a tempest amid the 1988 race, when wind chill temperatures dipped under . 

The outrageous temperatures represent a genuine wellbeing danger. Frostbite is normal, as is hypothermia. In the 1988 Yukon Quest, Jeff King endured an altogether solidified hand in view of nerve harm from prior damage which left him unfit to feel the virus. Lord said his hand moved toward becoming "like something from a solidified body". In 1989, King and his group drove through a break in the Yukon River in temperatures. Solidified by the outrageous cold, King figured out how to achieve a lodge and defrost. Different racers have experienced changeless harm the cool: Lance Mackey endured frostbitten feet amid the 2008 Yukon Quest, and Hugh Neff lost the tips of a few toes in the 2004 race. 

Since the race's origin in 1984, 353 individuals from 11 nations have contended in the Yukon Quest, some multiple occasions. The race pulls in from 21 (in 1996) to 47 (in 1988 and 1989) mushers every year. Of the 776 passages from 1984 to 2007, 263 (34%) did not wrap up. The racers have originated from different callings: cab drivers, swimming educators, coal excavators, charge assessors, attorneys, hide trappers, writers, and a vehicle sales rep have all entered. 

Toward the finish of the challenge, racers are given honors for accomplishments performed on the trail. The premier is the title grant, given to the victor. Going with this is the Golden Harness Award, given to the champ's two lead sled hounds. The following honor is the Veterinarians Choice Award, which is casted a ballot on by race veterinarians and given to the musher who took the best consideration of his or her canines amid the race. Different honors incorporate the Challenge of the North Awardâgiven to the musher who "represents the soul of the Yukon Quest"â and the Sportsmanship Award, given to the most sportsmanlike contender, as picked by a vote of the mushers. 

The Rookie of the Year Award is given to the most noteworthy completing first-time contender. The Dawson Award, comprising of four ounces of gold, is given to the principal musher to achieve Dawson City (the midpoint) who additionally completes the challenge. The last honor is the Red Lantern, given to the last official finisher of the year's race. Two honors have been ceased: the Kiwanis Award, given to the principal musher to cross the Alaskaâ Yukon outskirt, and the Mayor's Award, given to the Yukon Quest champion by the Mayor of Fairbanks. 

The 2011 Yukon Quest champion is Alaskan Dallas Seavey, who completed the race in 10 days, 11 hours and 53 minutes. Seavey, who has run the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race a few times, won the Yukon Quest in his new kid on the block year and accordingly additionally was named newbie of the year. Haliburton, Ontario musher Hank DeBruin won the 2011 Red Lantern Award by completing the race in 13 days, 10 hours, and 54 minutes. Without precedent for Yukon Quest history, more than one musher got the sportsmanship grant. Following the 2011 race, Allen Moore, Brent Sass and Mike Ellis shared the respect. Ken Anderson, who achieved Dawson City third, was the just a single of the main three by then to complete, and in this manner got the Dawson Award. Wasilla musher Kelley Griffin got the Spirit of the North honor, and the Veterinarian's Choice honor was given to Mike Ellis and his significant other/handler Sue Ellis. 

Mutts in the Yukon Quest arrive in an assortment of sizes and breeds, however the most widely recognized are Alaskan and Siberian Huskies weighing between . The Alaskan Husky is definitely not a perceived breed, yet an amalgam of a few unique sorts reared for speed, stamina, and quality. Siberian Huskies are a breed perceived by the American Kennel Club and are portrayed by thick coats, solid ears, a fox-like tail, and medium size. Siberian Huskies are ordinarily bigger and slower than their Alaskan partners, making mushers epithet the breed "Slowberians", yet have all the more pulling force. The thing that matters was seen amid the 1998 Yukon Quest, when Bruce Lee's group of Alaskan Huskies contended with AndrÃ© Nadeau's group of Siberians. Lee's group was quicker than Nadeau's over short stretches, yet Lee needed to rest all the more frequently. Nadeau had a head begin of the last checkpoint, yet Lee had the capacity to surpass him. 

The Yukon Quest supports members' independence, and one of its destinations is "[to] empower and encourage learning and use of the most stretched out assortment of shrub abilities and practices that structure the establishment of Arctic survival."
