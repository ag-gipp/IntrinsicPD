Collins' record-production innings drew an expansive group and expanding media intrigue; onlookers at the Old Cliftonian coordinate being played adjacent were attracted away to watch the lesser school building cricket coordinate in which Collins was playing. Regardless of this accomplishment, Collins never played top of the line cricket.

The match was played on an outfield off Guthrie Road, Bristol, presently named "Collins Piece". The ground had both a poor surface and a surprising shape: it was exceptionally short (just long), with a divider just away framing the limit on one side, while the opposite side was a delicate incline falling ceaselessly towards the school sanatorium out there. The pitch involved the focal of the restricted field, with the limit just behind each arrangement of stumps. Hits to the long limit, down the slant, must be altogether run, yet the three short limits meant two runs.

So splendid was his play that even the group viewing an Old Cliftonian coordinate being played close-by lost its advantage and a substantial group watched Collins' extraordinary execution. Collins' innings nearly finished at 400 when a simple catch was dropped by the most youthful player on the field, 11-year-old Victor Fuller-Eberle, yet at around 5.30Â pm, in the wake of batting for around five hours, blissful praise broke out when he passed Andrew Stoddart's reality record score of 485. Toward the second's end day, he stayed unbeaten on 509 and the group on 680 for 8.

Before the finish of play, Collins had been dropped once more, on 556, to achieve 598, yet another wicket had fallen, and Collins was coming up short on accomplices. On Tuesday, 27 June, the school specialists expanded the hours accessible for play trying to complete the match. The groups developed and media intrigue heightened, as "The Times" again provided details regarding the match on Tuesday, and the interruption to class life was significant. Collins hit out, with his methodology being portrayed as "out and out careless". He was dropped twice more, on 605 and 619. After only 25 minutes' play, Collins lost his last accomplice, Thomas Redfern, gotten by Victor Fuller-Eberle at point for 13, with Collins' score on 628.

The scorebook hangs in the structure at Clifton right up 'til the present time. The scorers confronted a troublesome errand in precisely recording the innings. One of them, Edward Peglar, is said to have commented that Collins' score was "628, give or take twenty will we say". The other scorer for the match was J. W. Lobby, whose father in 1868 had batted with Edward Tylecote, who later played Test cricket for England and whose name is on a lyric kept with the Ashes urn. Tylecote had before set a world-record score of 404 not out in 1868, likewise at Clifton. Corridor later composed that "The bowling likely merited all the noble scorn with which Collins treated it, sending an extensive number of pulls full pitch over the fives courts into the swimming showers to the threat of the inhabitants." 

Collins wound up open property for quite a while after the match, everlastingly connected with his incredible score. "Today all men talk about him", kept in touch with one paper, "â¦ he has a notoriety for being incredible as the most publicized cleanser: he will be deified." After leaving school, he never needed to be helped to remember his renowned innings; all things considered, he has been recalled well past his very own lifetime. 

Inside two years, 31-year-old Australian Test cricketer Charles Eady verged on breaking the record, when he made 566 for Break-o'- Day against Wellington in Hobart in under eight hours spread more than three weeks in March 1902. This stayed, for over a century, the nearest challenge to Collins' record: his score was at last beaten in January 2016 by Pranav Dhanawade, a 15-year-old Indian kid who scored 1,009 not out from 327 balls for KC Gandhi School against Arya Gurukul School in Mumbai.
