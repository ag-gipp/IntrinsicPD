Industrialisation all through the pulled in real Indian research, producing and budgetary establishments, including Defense Research and Development Organization, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, the National Geophysical Research Institute and the Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology. Exceptional financial zones devoted to data innovation have supported organizations from India and around the globe to set up activities in Hyderabad. The development of pharmaceutical and biotechnology ventures during the 1990s prompted the zone's naming as India's "Genome Valley". With a yield of 74Â billion, Hyderabad is the fifth-biggest supporter of India's general total national output. 

As indicated by John Everett-Heath, the creator of "Oxford Concise Dictionary of World Place Names", "Hyderabad" signifies "Haydar's city" or "lion city", from "haydar" (lion) and "ÄbÄd" (city), and was named to respect the Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib, who was otherwise called Haydar due to his lion-like valor in fights. Andrew Petersen, a researcher of Islamic engineering, says the city was initially called "Baghnagar" (city of greenhouses). One well known hypothesis recommends that the originator of the city, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of the Golconda Sultanate, named it after Bhagmati, a nearby "nautch" (moving) young lady with whom he had experienced passionate feelings for. She changed over to Islam and received the title "Hyder Mahal". The city was named as "Hyderabad" in her respect. 

As per German explorer Heinrich von Poser, whose travelog of the Deccan was interpreted by Gita Dharampal-Frick of Heidelberg University, there were two names for the city: "On 3 December 1622, we achieved the city of Bagneger or Hederabat, the seat of the ruler Sultan Mehemet Culi Cuttub Shah and the capital of the kingdom". French voyager Jean de ThÃ©venot visited the Deccan district in 1666â 1667 alludes to the city in his book "Goes in India" as "Bagnagar and Aiderabad". 

Archeologists exhuming close to the city have uncovered Iron Age destinations that may date from 500Â BCE. The area containing current Hyderabad and its surroundings was known as "Golkonda" (Golla Konda-"shepherd's slope"), and was controlled by the Chalukya tradition from 624Â CE to 1075Â CE. Following the disintegration of the Chalukya domain into four sections in the eleventh century, Golkonda went under the control of the Kakatiya administration from 1158, whose seat of intensity was at Warangal, upper east of present day Hyderabad. 

The Kakatiya line was decreased to a vassal of the Khalji administration in 1310 after its annihilation by Sultan Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate. This kept going until 1321, when the Kakatiya line was attached by Malik Kafur, Allaudin Khalji's general. Amid this period, Alauddin Khalji took the "Koh-I-Noor" precious stone, which is said to have been mined from the Kollur Mines of Golkonda, to Delhi. Muhammad container Tughluq prevailing to the Delhi sultanate in 1325, bringing Warangal under the standard of the Tughlaq line until 1347 when Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah, a senator under canister Tughluq, opposed Delhi and set up the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan Plateau, with Gulbarga, west of Hyderabad, as its capital. The Hyderabad region was under the control of the Musunuri Nayaks right now, who, in any case, were compelled to surrender it to the Bahmani Sultanate in 1364. The Bahmani lords administered the district until 1518 and were the primary free Muslim leaders of the Deccan. 

Sultan Quli, a legislative leader of Golkonda, rebelled against the Bahmani Sultanate and set up the Qutb Shahi administration in 1518; he modified the mud-stronghold of Golconda and named the city "Muhammad nagar". The fifth sultan, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, built up Hyderabad on the banks of the Musi River in 1591, to maintain a strategic distance from the water deficiencies experienced at Golkonda. Amid his standard, he had the Charminar and Mecca Masjid worked in the city. On 21 September 1687, the Golkonda Sultanate went under the standard of the Mughal sovereign Aurangzeb following a year-long attack of the Golkonda fortress. The attached city "Hyderabad" was renamed "Darul Jihad" (House of War), while its state "Golconda" was renamed "Deccan Suba" (Deccan area) and the capital was moved from Golconda to Aurangabad, about northwest of Hyderabad. 

In 1714 Farrukhsiyar, the Mughal sovereign, named Asif Jah I to be Viceroy of the Deccan, with the title "Nizam-ul-Mulk" (Administrator of the Realm). In 1724, Asif Jah I crushed Mubariz Khan to set up self-rule over the "Deccan Suba", named the area "Hyderabad Deccan", and began what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi administration. Consequent rulers held the title "Nizam ul-Mulk" and were alluded to as Asif Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad. The demise of Asif Jah I in 1748 brought about a time of political distress as his children, supported by entrepreneurial neighboring states and provincial remote powers, fought for the position of authority. The promotion of Asif Jah II, who ruled from 1762 to 1803, finished the shakiness. In 1768 he marked the arrangement of Machilipatnam, surrendering the beach front area toward the East India Company as an end-result of a fixed yearly lease. 

In 1769 Hyderabad city turned into the formal capital of the Nizams. In light of standard dangers from Hyder Ali (Dalwai of Mysore), Baji Rao I (Peshwa of the Maratha Empire), and Basalath Jung (Asif Jah II's senior sibling, who was bolstered by the Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau), the Nizam marked a backup union with the East India Company in 1798, enabling the British Indian Army to possess Bolarum (present day Secunderabad) to secure the state's capital, for which the Nizams paid a yearly upkeep to the British.

The Nizams ruled their august state from Hyderabad amid the British Raj. 

After India picked up freedom, the Nizam announced his aim to stay autonomous instead of become some portion of the Indian Union. The Hyderabad State Congress, with the help of the Indian National Congress and the Communist Party of India, started upsetting against Nizam VII in 1948. On 17 September that year, the Indian Army assumed responsibility for Hyderabad State after an intrusion codenamed Operation Polo. With the annihilation of his powers, Nizam VII ceded to the Indian Union by marking an Instrument of Accession, which made him the "Rajpramukh" (Princely Governor) of the state until 31 October 1956.
