He presents the robot, named Chitti, at an apply autonomy gathering in Chennai. Chitti helps Sana, Vaseegaran's restorative understudy sweetheart, cheat in her examination, at that point spares her from being ambushed by a gathering of hooligans. Vaseegaran's coach, Professor Bohra, is covertly occupied with a venture to make comparative android robots for a psychological oppressor association, however has so far been ineffective. 

Vaseegaran plans Chitti for an assessment by the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development (AIRD) Institute, which is going by Bohra. Amid the assessment, Chitti endeavors to cut Vaseegaran at Bohra's direction, which persuades the assessment council that the robot is a risk and can't be utilized for military purposes. Vaseegaran's push to refute Bohra comes up short when he conveys Chitti to protect individuals from a consuming structure. The robot spares the majority of them, including a young lady named Selvi who was washing at the time, however she is embarrassed at being seen bare on camera and escapes, just to be hit and killed by a truck. Vaseegaran requests one month to alter Chitti's neural mapping to empower it to comprehend human conduct and feelings, to which Bohra concurs. While nearing the due date, Chitti winds up irate with Vaseegaran, showing to him that it can show feelings. 

Chitti utilizes Sana's course books to effectively help Sana's sister Latha bring forth a kid. Bohra salutes Vaseegaran on the accomplishment and permits Chitti to pass the AIRD assessment.

Bohra visits the site to recover Chitti, which has now reassembled itself, but in a harmed state. Bohra inserts a red chip inside Chitti while reproducing it, changing over it into rendition 2.0, which is increasingly forceful and unempathetic. It then gatecrashes Vaseegaran and Sana's wedding, captures Sana, makes imitations of itself and executes Bohra. Utilizing its robot armed force, Chitti possesses AIRD and causes pandemonium in the city. In the wake of educating Sana that it has obtained the human capacity to duplicate, Chitti wishes to wed her with the goal that a machine and a person can bring forth a prearranged youngster, however Sana won't. It in the long run discovers Vaseegaran, who entered AIRD to stop it, and about executes him before the police show up. The following fight between Chitti's robot armed force and the police faculty prompts a ton of property decimation and numerous setbacks. Vaseegaran in the long run catches Chitti utilizing an attractive divider and gets to its inward control board, whereby he trains the various robots to self-destruct.
