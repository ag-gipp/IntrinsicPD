Global Environment and Trade Study

The Global Environment & Trade Study (GETS) was a non-profit research institute established in 1994 to study the complex linkages between international trade and environmental sustainability. GETS supported numerous research projects on the legal, economic, and ecological aspects of trade and environment.

GETS was centered at Yale University.

GETS also studied the expanding role of civil society in global governance.

In 2004, the GETS Board decided that a sufficient amount had been accomplished over the decade, and that it was time to terminate the project.

GETS had four major accomplishments: 

The founders of GETS were: James Cameron, Steve Charnovitz, Daniel Esty, and Mark Ritchie. 

In 2000, Monica Araya joined the GETS Board and focused on environment, trade and investment issues in developing countries.

Some staff associated with GETS included Orin Kirshner, who served as Executive Director from 2001–2003, Beatrice Chaytor, Hari Osofsky, and John Wickham.

GETS had three major participating institutions—the Foundation for International Environmental Law and Development (located in London), the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (located in Minneapolis), 
and the Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy (located in New Haven)

In addition, GETS collaborated with numerous research institutes in developed and developing countries.

GETS held policy conferences or workshops in Cancun, Geneva, London, Miami, New York, Seattle, Tokyo, and Washington.

GETS also held a major Conference in Singapore in June 1996 co-sponsored with the National University of Singapore. At the end of that Conference, the co-chairs (Tommy Koh, Dan Esty, and James Cameron) issued a statement with several recommendations, many of which were adopted by the WTO, other international organizations, and governments in subsequent years.

The major funders of GETS included: the Ford Foundation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Netherlands Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment, the German-Marshall Fund, the John D. & Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Center for Global Partnership/Japan Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts, and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.

A retrospective on competitiveness and the Council's work was recently written by Martin Neil Baily and Robert Z. Lawrence.

Principals and researchers supported by GETS produced dozens of books and articles on trade and the environment, and related topics during its ten years of operation. Among them were:

"Achieving Harmony in Trade and Environment," http://www.gets.org/pages/harmony/.
