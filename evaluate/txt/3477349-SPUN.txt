Neilston is a residence town with an inhabitant populace of a little more than 5,000 individuals. 

Neilston is referenced in reports from the twelfth century, when the primitive master Robert de Croc, supplied a house of prayer to Paisley Abbey toward the North. Neilston Parish Churchâa Category B recorded structureâis said to be on the site of this unique sanctuary and has been at the focal point of the network since 1163. Little survives from the first structure. Prior to industrialisation, Neilston was a dissipated cultivating settlement made out of a progression of single-story houses, a significant number of them covered. Some residential weaving was completed utilizing nearby flax. Water control from adjacent streams ground corn and gave an appropriate situation to blanching the flax. 

The urbanization and improvement of Neilston came to a great extent with the Industrial Revolution. Mechanical scale material handling was acquainted with Neilston around the center of the eighteenth century with the structure of a few cotton factories. Neilston turned into an inside for cotton and calico blanching and imprinting in the eighteenth century, which formed into a turning and biting the dust business, and proceeded into the mid twentieth century. In spite of the fact that Neilston is known as a previous processing town, agribusiness has played, and keeps on playing, a financial job.

Nearby students of history have proposed different hypotheses for the source of the name Neilston. In spite of the fact that the principal component is probably going to get from either the Gaelic forename "Niall" (genitive "NÃ¨ill") or else from the French "Nigel", there is difference about whether the second component speaks to the English "stone" or "town". The most punctual notice of Neilston is in the "Chartulary of Paisley Abbey", which specifies that the Anglo-Norman knight, Robert Croc of "Crocstown" (Crookston), doled out the support of "Neilstoun" to the priests of St Mirren's in 1163, on condition that masses ought to be routinely said to assist his spirit. G. W. S. Wheelbarrel recommended that the settlement might be related to the adherent of Walter fitz Alan, Lord of Kyle and Strathgryfe (and master ruler of Robert Croc), named "Nigel de Cotentin". 

In spite of this, a few essayists have given etymological clarifications which post-date 1163. For example, it has been composed that "Neil" was a General of King Haakon IV of Norway, who, escaping from the Battle of Largs (1263), was surpassed in this area and put to death.

In the Middle Ages Neilston's situation in the Barrhead Gap, a pass connecting Ayrshire to Glasgow, gave it vital significance. Robert Croc may have had a stronghold or watchtower at Coldoun in Neilston in the twelfth century. "Doun" is a debasement of "dun" which means stronghold or post, and the prefix maybe infers the absence of physical warmth inside the pinnacle or the welcome gotten by unwelcome visitors.
