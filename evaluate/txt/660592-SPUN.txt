Old Trafford () is a football arena in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, and the home of Manchester United. With a limit of 74,994, it is the biggest club football arena (and second biggest football arena by and large after Wembley Stadium) in the United Kingdom, and the eleventh-biggest in Europe. It is about from Old Trafford Cricket Ground and the contiguous cable car stop. 

Nicknamed "The Theater of Dreams" by Bobby Charlton, Old Trafford has been United's home ground since 1910, in spite of the fact that from 1941 to 1949 the club imparted Maine Road to neighborhood rivals Manchester City because of Second World War bomb harm. Old Trafford experienced a few extensions during the 1990s, and 2000s, including the expansion of additional levels toward the North, West and East Stands, practically restoring the arena to its unique limit of 80,000. Future extension is probably going to include the expansion of a second level toward the South Stand, which would raise the ability to around 88,000. The arena's record participation was recorded in 1939, when 76,962 observers viewed the FA Cup semi-last between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town. 

Old Trafford has facilitated FA Cup semi-finals, England apparatuses, matches at the 1966 World Cup and Euro 96 and the 2003 Champions League Final, just as rugby group's yearly Super League Grand Final and the last of two Rugby League World Cups. It likewise facilitated football matches at the 2012 Summer Olympics, including ladies' universal football without precedent for its history. 

Prior to 1902, Manchester United were known as Newton Heath, amid which time they previously played their football matches at North Road and after that Bank Street in Clayton. Be that as it may, the two grounds were cursed by pathetic conditions, the pitches running from rock to bog, while Bank Street experienced billows of exhaust from its neighboring industrial facilities. Consequently, following the club's salvage from close chapter 11 and renaming, the new executive John Henry Davies chose in 1909 that the Bank Street ground was not fit for a group that had as of late won the First Division and FA Cup, so he gave assets for the development of another arena. Not one to burn through cash pointlessly, Davies explored around Manchester for a fitting site, before settling on a fix of land neighboring the Bridgewater Canal, simply off the north end of the Warwick Road in Old Trafford. 

Structured by Scottish modeler Archibald Leitch, who planned a few other stadia, the ground was initially planned with a limit of 100,000 observers and included seating in the south remain under spread, while the staying three stands were left as porches and revealed. Counting the buy of the land, the development of the arena was initially to have cost Â£60,000 by and large. In any case, as expenses started to ascend, to achieve the proposed limit would have cost an additional Â£30,000 over the first gauge and, at the recommendation of club secretary J. J. Bentley, the limit was diminished to roughly 80,000. All things considered, when exchange charges were still around the Â£1,000 mark, the expense of development just served to fortify the club's "Moneybags United" sobriquet, with which they had been tarred since Davies had taken over as executive. 

In May 1908, Archibald Leitch kept in touch with the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) â who had a rail stop adjoining the proposed site for the football ground â trying to influence them to sponsor development of the show off close by the railroad line. The appropriation would have gone to the whole of Â£10,000, to be paid back at the rate of Â£2,000 "per annum" for a long time or half of the entryway receipts for the show off every year until the advance was reimbursed. Notwithstanding, regardless of certifications for the credit originating from the club itself and two neighborhood distilleries, both led by club executive John Henry Davies, the Cheshire Lines Committee turned the proposition down. The CLC had wanted to construct another station neighboring the new arena, with the guarantee of a foreseen Â£2,750 "per annum" in charges counterbalancing the Â£9,800 cost of structure the station. The station â Trafford Park â was in the end assembled, however sometime later than initially arranged. The CLC later developed an unobtrusive station with one timber-fabricated stage promptly contiguous the arena and this opened on 21 August 1935. It was at first named United Football Ground, however was renamed Old Trafford Football Ground in mid 1936. It was served on match days just by a bus administration of steam trains from Manchester Central railroad station. It is as of now known as Manchester United Football Ground. 

Development was done by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester and improvement was finished in late 1909. The arena facilitated its debut amusement on 19 February 1910, with United playing host to Liverpool. Be that as it may, the home side were unfit to furnish their fans with a success to check the event, as Liverpool won 4â 3. A columnist at the amusement detailed the arena as "the most handsomest [sic], the most open and the most wonderful field I have ever observed. As a football ground it is unrivaled on the planet, it is a respect to Manchester and the home of a group who can do ponders when they are so arranged". 

Before the development of Wembley Stadium in 1923, the FA Cup Final was facilitated by various distinctive grounds around England including Old Trafford. The first of these was the 1911 FA Cup Final replay between Bradford City and Newcastle United, after the first tie at Crystal Palace completed as a no-score draw after additional time. Bradford won 1â 0, the objective scored by Jimmy Speirs, in a match viewed by 58,000 individuals. The ground's second FA Cup Final was the 1915 last between Sheffield United and Chelsea. Sheffield United won the match 3â 0 before about 50,000Â spectators, the greater part of whom were in the military, prompting the last being nicknamed "the Khaki Cup Final". On 27 December 1920, Old Trafford played host to its biggest pre-Second World War participation for a United class coordinate, as 70,504 observers viewed the Red Devils lose 3â 1 to Aston Villa. The ground facilitated its first worldwide football coordinate soon thereafter, when England lost 1â 0 to Scotland before 49,429Â spectators on 17 April 1926. Strangely, the record participation at Old Trafford isn't for a Manchester United home diversion. Rather, on 25 March 1939, 76,962Â people viewed a FA Cup semi-last between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town. 

In 1936, as a feature of a Â£35,000 restoration, a 80-yard-long rooftop was added to the United Road stand (presently the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand) out of the blue, while rooftops were added toward the south corners in 1938. Upon the episode of the Second World War, Old Trafford was demanded by the military to be utilized as a terminal. Football kept on being played at the arena, yet a German shelling attack on Trafford Park on 22 December 1940 harmed the arena to the degree that a Christmas day apparatus against Stockport County must be changed to Stockport's ground. Football continued at Old Trafford on 8 March 1941, however another German attack on 11 March 1941 crushed a great part of the arena, outstandingly the principle stand (presently the South Stand), compelling the club's tasks to move to Cornbrook Cold Storage, claimed by United administrator James W. Gibson. After weight from Gibson, the War Damage Commission conceded Manchester United Â£4,800 to evacuate the trash and Â£17,478 to reconstruct the stands. Amid the recreation of the arena, Manchester United played their "home" diversions at Maine Road, the home of their cross-town rivals, Manchester City, at an expense of Â£5,000 per year in addition to a level of the door receipts. The club was presently Â£15,000 in the red, not helped by the rental of Maine Road, and the Labor MP for Stoke, Ellis Smith, requested of the Government to expand the club's pay bundle, however it was futile. In spite of the fact that Old Trafford was revived, though without spread, in 1949, it implied that a class diversion had not been played at the arena for about 10 years. Joined's first diversion back at Old Trafford was played on 24 August 1949, as 41,748Â spectators saw a 3â 0 triumph over Bolton Wanderers. 

A rooftop was reestablished to the Main Stand by 1951 and, before long, the three residual stands were secured, the activity coming full circle with the expansion of a rooftop to the Stretford End (presently the West Stand) in 1959. The club additionally put Â£40,000 in the establishment of appropriate floodlighting, with the goal that they would most likely utilize the arena for the European amusements that were played in the late night of weekdays, rather than playing at Maine Road. So as to keep away from prominent shadows being thrown on the pitch, two segments of the Main Stand rooftop were removed. The main match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford was a First Division coordinate between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957. 

Nonetheless, in spite of the fact that the observers would now have the capacity to see the players around evening time, despite everything they experienced the issue of impeded perspectives brought about by the columns that upheld the rooftops. With the 1966 FIFA World Cup quick drawing closer, this incited the United chiefs to totally upgrade the United Road (north) stand. The old rooftop columns were supplanted in 1965 with current style cantilevering over the rooftop, permitting each onlooker a totally unhampered view, while it was additionally extended to hold 20,000 observers (10,000 situated and 10,000 remaining in front) at an expense of Â£350,000. The draftsmen of the new stand, Mather and Nutter (presently Atherden Fuller), revised the association of the remain to have terracing at the front, a bigger situated region towards the back, and the primary private boxes at a British football ground. The east stand â the main staying revealed stand â was created in a similar style in 1973. With the initial two stands changed over to cantilevers, the club's proprietors formulated a long haul intend to do likewise to the next two stands and convert the arena into a bowl-like field. Such an endeavor would serve to build the air inside the ground by containing the group's commotion and centering it onto the pitch, where the players would feel the full impacts of a limit swarm. In the interim, the arena facilitated its third FA Cup Final, facilitating 62,078 observers for the replay of the 1970 last among Chelsea and Leeds United; Chelsea won the match 2â 1. The ground additionally facilitated the second leg of the 1968 Intercontinental Cup, which saw Estudiantes de La Plata win the glass after a 1â 1 draw. The 1970s saw the sensational ascent of football hooliganism in Britain, and a blade tossing occurrence in 1971 constrained the club to erect the nation's first edge fence, confining fans from the Old Trafford pitch. 

1973 saw the culmination of the rooftop around the outline of the arena, alongside the expansion of 5,500 seats to the Scoreboard End and the substitution of the old manual scoreboard with an electronic one in the north-east corner. At that point, in 1975, a Â£3Â million development was started, beginning with the expansion of the Executive Suite to the Main Stand. The suite's eatery disregarded the pitch, however the view was as yet hindered by the rooftop columns. Along these lines, in kind with the tops of the United Road Stand and the Scoreboard End, the Main Stand rooftop was supplanted with a cantilever structure. The Executive Suite and cantilever rooftop were then reached out to the full length of the stand, taking into account the movement of the club workplaces from the south-east corner to the Main Stand. The south-east quadrant was then evacuated and supplanted in 1985 with a situated segment bringing the all out seating limit of the arena to 25,686 (56,385 generally speaking). The fulfillment of the cantilever rooftop around three sides of the arena took into account the substitution of the old floodlight arches, and the connection of a column of floodlights around the internal edge of the rooftop in 1987. 

With each consequent improvement made to the ground since the Second World War, the limit relentlessly declined. By the 1980s, the limit had dropped from the first 80,000 to roughly 60,000. The limit dropped still further in 1990, when the Taylor Report prescribed, and the legislature requested that all First and Second Division stadia be changed over to all-seaters. This implied Â£3â 5Â million intends to supplant the Stretford End with a fresh out of the box new remain with an all-standing porch at the front and a cantilever rooftop to interface with the remainder of the ground must be radically modified. This constrained redevelopment, including the evacuation of the patios at the front of the other three stands, expanded the expense to around Â£10Â million, yet in addition diminished the limit of Old Trafford to an untouched low of around 44,000. What's more, the club was told in 1992 that they would just get Â£1.4Â million of a conceivable Â£2Â million from the Football Trust to be put towards business related to the Taylor Report. 

The club's resurgence in progress and increment in notoriety in the mid 1990s guaranteed that further advancement would need to happen. In 1995, the 30-year-old North Stand was destroyed and work rapidly started on another remain, to be prepared in time for Old Trafford to have three gathering diversions, a quarter-last and a semi-last at Euro 96. The club acquired the Trafford Park exchanging domain, a site on the other site of United Road, for Â£9.2Â million in March 1995. Development started in June 1995 and was finished by May 1996, with the initial two of the three periods of the stand opening amid the season. Planned by Atherden Fuller, with Hilstone Laurie as task and development chiefs and Campbell Reith Hill as basic architects, the new three-layered stand cost a sum of Â£18.65Â million to assemble and had a limit of around 25,500, raising the limit of the whole ground to more than 55,000. The cantilever rooftop would likewise be the biggest in Europe, estimating from the back divider to the front edge. Further accomplishment throughout the following couple of years ensured yet greater advancement. Initial, a second level was added toward the East Stand. Opened in January 2000, the arena's ability was incidentally expanded to around 61,000 until the opening of the West Stand's second level, which included one more 7,000Â seats, bringing the ability to 68,217.

The shop was then moved along the length of the South Stand, ceasing first inverse where away fans enter the ground, and after that dwelling in the structure that would later turn into the club's marketing office. A flood in the club's fame in the mid 1990s prompted another move, this opportunity to the forecourt of the West Stand. With this move came an incredible development and the change from a little shop to a "megastore". Alex Ferguson opened the new megastore on 3 December 1994. The latest moves came in the late 1990s, as the West Stand expected space to extend to a second level, and that implied the devastation of the megastore.

A replication of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand advancement and North-East and North-West Quadrants would see the arena's ability ascend to an expected 95,000, which would give it a more noteworthy limit than Wembley Stadium (90,000). Any such improvement is probably going to cost around Â£100Â million, because of the vicinity of the railroad line that runs contiguous the arena, and the comparing need to work over it and subsequently buy up to 50 houses on the opposite side of the rail route. In any case, the Manchester United gathering property chief affirmed that development plans are in the pipeline â connected to benefits produced using the club's property possessions around Manchester â saying "There is a vital arrangement for the stadiumÂ ... It isn't our goal to stop". One analysis of the plans, in any case, is that expanding the stature of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand would additionally lessen the measure of light going onto the pitch, which has caused issues in also substantial stadia â, for example, Wembley Stadium, the Santiago BernabÃ©u Stadium and the San Siro; as per Alex Ferguson, the improvements on different stands have just caused issues. It was additionally recommended that, should such a development happen, Old Trafford could be utilized rather than Wembley for enormous matches, for example, England internationals â so as to expand the capacity of fans in the north of the nation to watch England play; and FA Cup semi-finals â to keep up the eminence of the national arena for the last.
