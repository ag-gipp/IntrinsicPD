The Diary of a Nobody 

The Diary of a Nobody is an English comic novel composed by the siblings George and Weedon Grossmith, with outlines by the last mentioned. It began as a discontinuous sequential in "Punch" magazine in 1888â 89 and first showed up in book structure, with broadened message and included outlines, in 1892. The "Journal" records the every day occasions in the lives of a London agent, Charles Pooter, his better half Carrie, his child William Lupin, and various companions and associates over a time of 15 months. 

Before their joint effort on the "Journal", the siblings every sought after effective professions on the stage. George began nine of the foremost entertainer jobs in the Gilbert and Sullivan musical shows more than 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He likewise settled a national notoriety as a piano sketch performer and composed an extensive number of melodies and comic pieces. Before leaving on his stage profession, Weedon had filled in as a craftsman and artist. The "Journal" was the siblings' solitary develop joint effort. The greater part of its diversion gets from Charles Pooter's oblivious and outlandish feeling of his own significance, and the recurrence with which this dream is punctured by blunders and minor social embarrassments. In a time of rising desires inside the lower-working classes, the every day schedules and humble aspirations portrayed in the "Journal" were in a split second perceived by its contemporary perusers, and gave later ages a look at the past that it ended up trendy to mimic. 

In spite of the fact that its underlying open gathering was quieted, the "Journal" came to be perceived by faultfinders as an exemplary work of amusingness, and it has never been no longer available. It built up a type of hilarious well known fiction dependent on lower or lower-white collar class yearnings, and was the trailblazer of various invented journal books in the later twentieth century. The "Journal" has been the subject of a few phase and screen adjustments, including Ken Russell's "quiet film" treatment of 1964, a four-section TV film scripted by Andrew Davies in 2007, and a broadly applauded stage form in 2011, in which an all-male cast of three played every one of the parts. 

"The Diary of a Nobody" was crafted by George Grossmith and his sibling Weedon Grossmith, the children of a court journalist and low maintenance arrange performer, likewise named George. The more youthful George pursued his dad, first as a correspondent and later on the stage; the 7-years-more youthful Weedon learned at the West London School of Art and had some accomplishment as a representation painter before turning into a comic performer. The siblings were interested with the phase at an early age. In 1864, at 17 and 10, they facilitated a mind boggling system of melodic and sensational diversion in their folks' greenery enclosure at Haverstock Hill. This incorporated a 20-minute vaudeville variant of "Hamlet", in which George assumed the title job; Weedon was Ophelia. 

By 1877 the more youthful George Grossmith had set up himself as a comic piano sketch performer in common establishments and abstract social orders. In that year he was seen by Arthur Sullivan and, independently, by W. S. Gilbert, in exhibitions of their one-demonstration comic musical drama "Preliminary by Jury". Awed, they connected with him to play the comic lead in their new, full-length work, "The Sorcerer". From that point, Grossmith made the main comic job in every one of Gilbert and Sullivan's long-running comic musical dramas until "The Yeomen of the Guard", which shut in 1889. While showing up in the musical dramas, Grossmith proceeded with his piano diversion profession at private gatherings and early shows, composing and forming his very own material. He turned into the best comic performer of his day, composing various operettas, around 100 piano portrays, somewhere in the range of 600 tunes and short piano pieces, and three books. For "Punch" magazine in 1884 he gave a progression of short draws dependent on his encounters as a court columnist at Bow Street Magistrates' Court. In 1889, Grossmith finished his association with Gilbert and Sullivan to seek after his piano sketch vocation full-time and kept on performing until 1908. He kicked the bucket in 1912. 

As a craftsman Weedon Grossmith displayed at the Royal Academy and at the Grosvenor Gallery. He likewise contributed representations to "Punch" and the esteemed "Craftsmanship Journal". He was by and by disappointed with his budgetary prospects as a craftsman, and by 1885 was seeking after an elective profession as a performer. He proceeded with his profession on the phase with significant accomplishment until 1918, making his name assuming jobs he portrayed as "weaklings, creeps and braggarts", and as frightened little men under the thumb of power. He composed a few plays, of which "The Night of the Party" (1901) was his best, and from 1894 was occupied with the administration of two West End theaters. He kicked the bucket in 1919. The abstract researcher Peter Morton, who distributed a clarified release of the "Journal" in 2009, proposes that a large number of the occasions delineated in it were drawn from the siblings' very own home encounters, and that Weedon, "something of a scapegrace contrasted and his stickler sibling", was the model for Lupin. 

The journal starts on 3 April of an implicit year, and keeps running for around 15 months. In a short preface, perusers are educated that Charles Pooter and his better half Caroline (Carrie) have quite recently moved to another home at "The Laurels", Brickfield Terrace, Holloway. Mr Pooter is a City of London agent with Perkupps, conceivably a bookkeeping or private financial firm (however their business isn't expressly expressed). The couple's 20-year-old child William functions as a bank agent in Oldham. The main sections depict the Pooters' every day lives and present their specific companions, for example, their neighbor Gowing, the energetic bicyclist Cummings, and the Jameses from Sutton. From the earliest starting point an example is set whereby the little vexations of the Pooters' every day lives are related, a large number of them emerging from Pooter's oblivious gaudiness and affectedness. Issue with workers, tradesmen, and office youngsters happen consistently, alongside minor social shames and embarrassments. 

The uncommon formal get-togethers in the Pooters' lives are specific magnets for mishap. They get a welcome from the Lord Mayor of London to go to a ball at the Mansion House for "Agents of Trade and Commerce". Following quite a while of sharp expectation they are overwhelmed, when they land, to find that the social occasion is undistinguished. Pooter is gaudily disturbed to be welcomed recognizably by his nearby ironmonger, significantly more so when this tradesman has all the earmarks of being on social terms with a portion of the more essential visitors. Pooter revels in champagne and embarrasses Carrie by falling on the move floor. 

In the mid year their child touches base from Oldham and illuminates his folks that he wishes hereafter to be called by his center name, "Lupin." He has been expelled from his bank post for inaction; albeit daunted, Pooter considers this to be an opportunity to get his child into Perkupps. Lupin joins the couple for their yearly occasion week in Broadstairs, however connections are stressed by Lupin's "quick" propensities. On their arrival, Pooter's endeavors to get Lupin a line of work at first demonstrate unprofitable. The kid is keen on beginner shows and joins an association called the "Holloway Comedians". With the assistance of Pooter's boss Mr. Perkupp, Lupin at long last verifies an administrative position with a firm of stockbrokers in November. He at that point stuns his folks by reporting his commitment. 

Lupin's life partner, Daisy Mutlar, is the sister of one of his showy companions and is, he says, "the most delightful, prettiest, and most achieved young lady he at any point met". Pooter is frustrated when he meets her: "She is a major young lady... no less than eight years more established than Lupin. I didn't think her gorgeous". By the by, in her respect the Pooters give a vast evening gathering, to which Pooter welcomes Mr Perkupp. The gathering ends up clamorous; Mr Perkupp touches base at an especially rambunctious minute, and chooses not to remain. Pooter trusts the gathering has fizzled, and is down and out, in spite of the fact that Carrie esteems it an incredible achievement. In any case, inside a couple of days, Lupin advises them that the commitment is off. 

In the next weeks Lupin frequently takes the Holloway troupe back to "The Laurels". These events are graced with the unexplained nearness of a total more interesting, Mr Padge, who routinely possesses the best seat as though of right. Lupin quits the family's Christmas festivities, and after that reports, to everybody's bewilderment, that the commitment to Daisy is back on. Christmas passes joyfully enough, in spite of a dinner party which deteriorates into a sustenance battle actuated by Daisy. 

In the New Year, Pooter is elevated to senior representative at Perkupp's, and his pay raised by Â£100 per year, yet his accomplishment is dominated by Lupin's declaration that he has only benefitted by Â£200 through an auspicious offers hypothesis. Lupin induces his dad, and Gowing and Cummings, to put little totals in Parachikka Chlorates, the wellspring of his increases. The Pooters meet another companion of Lupin's, Mr Murray Posh, who Pooter believes is to some degree over-acquainted with Daisy and might, he cautions Lupin, be an adversary for her hand. Lupin pooh-poohs this idea. Afterward, Pooter discovers that he and his companions have lost their speculation; in fact, Lupin's stockbroking firm has fell totally and its central has fled. Lupin is in this manner jobless; more regrettable, that equivalent day the commitment of Daisy Mutlar to Murray Posh is reported. Lupin's solitary encouragement, he tells his dad, is that he induced Posh to put Â£600 in Parachikka Chlorates. In any case, in Pooter's eyes the circumstance is reclaimed when Mr Perkupp offers Lupin a clerkship. 

April starts with another social debacle. The Pooters get a solicitation to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which they envision will be a sparkling event. It ends up being ratty and down-at-heel; besides, having generously provided individual visitorsâamong them Mr Padgeâwith sustenance and drink which he supposes is free, Pooter is exhibited toward the end with a huge bill that he can scarcely stand to pay. Other get-togethers additionally go bad: a lunch party with Mr Finsworth, the dad of an old companion, is damaged by some appalling remarks by Pooter on the Finsworth family pictures. On another event they meet an uproarious and over-stubborn American, Mr Hardfur Huttle who, Pooter acknowledges, resembles a develop adaptation of Lupin. 

Lupin is sacked from Perkupps for influencing their top customer, Mr Crowbillion, to take his business to another firm. Pooter is humiliated, yet the new firm rewards Lupin with Â£25 commission and an occupation at Â£200 per year. Lupin continues his companionship with Murray Posh and Daisy, who is currently Mrs Posh. Lupin moves to lodgings in Bayswater, where Pooter and Carrie are welcome to eat and where they meet Murray's sister, known as "Lillie Girl", a lady of around 30. Pooter discovers that Murray Posh has settled Â£10,000 on both Daisy and "Lillie Girl". 

Pooter is brought to meet Hardfur Huttle, who offers Perkupps another customer to supplant Mr Crowbillion. Perkupp is so appreciative to Pooter for this presentation that he purchases up the freehold of "The Laurels" and presents the deeds to Pooter. As the couple praise, a letter touches base from Lupin reporting his commitment to "Lillie Girl": "We will be hitched in August, and among our visitors we want to see your old companions Gowing and Cummings". 

The "Journal" showed up as an irregular sequential in the sarcastic week after week magazine "Punch". The first of the 26 portions was declared in the issue of 26 May 1888 with a concise publication note: "As everyone who is anyone is distributing Reminiscences, Diaries, Notes, Autobiographies, and Recollections, we are genuinely thankful to 'A Nobody' for allowing us to add to the noteworthy gathering". The journal passage dates are half a month behind the dates on which they show up in "Punch". 

The "Punch" serialization finished in May 1889 with the journal section for 21 March, which records the Pooters and their companions commending the minor triumph of Lupin's arrangement as an assistant at Perkupps. That was the expected end of the journal; nonetheless, when the authors were setting up the original copy for distribution as a book, they included a further four months' entrances to the content, and included 26 outlines by Weedon Grossmith. 

In June 1892 J.W. Arrowsmith Ltd distributed the "Journal" in book structure, in spite of the fact that its basic and well known achievement was not obvious until the third release showed up in October 1910. After the First World War the book's prevalence kept on developing; standard reprintings and new versions guaranteed that from that point the book was never no longer in production. Book recording variants have been accessible since 1982. The author Robert McCrum, in an individual rundown of "The 100 biggest books ever" distributed in "The Observer" paper, recorded the "Journal" at number 35. 

The "Punch" serialization pulled in minimal basic remark; "The Athenaeum"s scholarly commentator figured the arrangement "may have gotten away unnoticed in the midst of better jokes". At the point when the "Journal" was distributed as a book, "Punch" proclaimed it in its issue of 23 July 1892 as "exceptionally entertaining", including: "not without a bit of sentiment". Be that as it may, aside from an energetically affirming report in "The Saturday Review", the book's underlying basic gathering was tepid. The "Review"s commentator thought the book "splendid, and in a portion of its contacts [it] goes near virtuoso", with a characteristic and powerful intrigue: "The "Journal" has diverted us from spread to cover". This diverged from the negative judgment of "The Athenaeum", which opined that "the book has no legitimacy to make up for its miserable profanity, not in any case that of being interesting". It doubted the elegance of jokes pointed only at the destitution of came up short on city agents, and closed: "Moreover, it is all so dull". "The Speaker"s faultfinder thought the book "an investigation in foulness", while "The New York Times", inspecting the principal American release, found the work to a great extent unimaginable: "There is that sort of tranquil, ordinary, regular kidding in it which we are to assume is profoundly agreeable to our cousins over the waterÂ ... Our method for assembling fun is extraordinary". In spite of the fact that subtleties of offers figures are not given, Arrowsmiths later recognized that the early releases of the book did not have a wide open effect. 

By 1910 the "Journal" was starting to accomplish a notoriety in London's abstract and political circles. In his paper "On People in Books", distributed prior that year, the author and humourist Hilaire Belloc hailed the "Journal" as "one of the about six eternal accomplishments of our timeÂ ... a magnificence for every one of us". Among other people who recorded their energy about the work were Lord Rosebery, the previous executive, who disclosed to Arrowsmiths that he thought he had "obtained and given away a greater number of duplicates than any living manÂ ... I see any room I possess as empty without a duplicate of it". Another writer cum-lawmaker who included his tribute was Augustine Birrell, who in 1910 involved the bureau post of Chief Secretary for Ireland. Birrell composed that he positioned Charles Pooter close by Don Quixote as a comic scholarly figure, and included a note of individual pride that one of the characters in the bookâ"an ignorant charwoman, it is valid"â conveyed his name. Arrowsmiths printed these thanks as introductions in the 1910 and ensuing issues. The 1910 release demonstrated quickly prominent with the perusing open, and was trailed by various reprintings. In its audit of this version "The Bookman" s commentator composed of Charles Pooter: "You snicker at himâat his little absurdities, his funny accidents, his good natured particularity; yet he wins upon you and gets your love, and even your profound respect, he is so straightforwardly genuine, so magnificently and ludicrously human". 

In its survey of the book's fourth release, distributed in 1919, "The Bookman" saw that the book was currently a firm most loved with the general population. "It has had numerous imitatorsÂ ... be that as it may, not one of them has matched the first, and they have all blurred away". The analyst suggested the book's "interesting joke, its unusual parody and brilliantly calm incongruity". In Canada, "Ruler's Quarterly" magazine's thoughtful gathering of the book appeared differently in relation to that of the "New York Times" almost 30 years already. It adulates the downplayed yet adorable self-representation of Pooter, and includes that "It isn't till the second or third perusingâand you will undoubtedly rehash itâthat the truly consummate specialty of this unstudied book winds up obvious". The scholarly faultfinder D. B. Wyndham Lewis outlined the Pooters as "warm, absolutely real, pointless, insane, extraordinarily alive and charming blockheads". 

The author Evelyn Waugh had been comfortable with the "Journal" since his youth. It was an incredible most loved of his folksâArthur Waugh used to peruse sections out loud to his family, and Evelyn's biographer Selena Hastings has attracted regard for the unmistakably Pooterish components in the Waugh family. Evelyn Waugh was at first derisive of the book, yet developed to appreciate it, to the degree of writing in his 1930 article "One Way to Immortality" that it was "the most amusing book on the planet". He included: "No one needs to peruse other individuals' appearance on life and religion and governmental issues, however the daily practice of their day, appropriately recorded, is continually intriguing, and will turn out to be all the more so as conditions change with the years". Morton places that few of the main characters in Waugh's initial books, however socially far expelled from the Pooters, share the bewilderment of Charles and Carrie with the issues of an evolving world. In his 1945 novel "Brideshead Revisited", Waugh has Lady Marchmain consoling her family by perusing so anyone might hear from the "Journal" "with her lovely voice and incredible silliness of articulation". Morton proposes that one of the work's attractions to Waugh was his own relationship with Lupin, and the manner by which the disliked child (as Waugh saw himself) more than once figures out how to turn antagonistic conditions further bolstering his definitive good fortune. 

At about the time that Waugh was finding his warmth for the "Journal" another essayist, J. B. Priestley, was praising it as a model of English diversion; Jerome K. Jerome, Priestley attested, never composed anything as great: "[P]oor Mr Pooter, with his effortlessness, his tentativeness, his integrity of heart, isn't just a figure of fun yet one of those blameless, adorable boneheads who are of high repute to the heart". In a 1943 article, George Orwell considered the book an exact record of English life during the 1880s. In portraying Pooter he resuscitated the Don Quixote relationship yet observed this English proportional as a sentimentalized adaptation of the first, one who "always endures calamities brought upon him by his very own habit". In the years after the Second World War the book's stock stayed high; Osbert Lancaster regarded it "an extraordinary masterpiece", and comparable excitement was communicated by another age of essayists and social students of history. Gillian Tindall, writing in 1970, thought the "Journal" "the best comic novel in the language", and commended Pooter as "the directing shade" of his time. This award was reverberated a further age on by A. N. Wilson, who wrote in his investigation of the Victorian time: "Who is to state that Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley are more average of the [1890s] than the lower-white collar class Charles and Carrie Pooter?" Wilson likewise watched the degree to which the Pooters had turned out to be perceived as "referees of the best great taste", as the late twentieth century English working classes tried to procure or save credible Victorian highlights in their painstakingly created "period" homes. An "Observer" article of 2008 comments on how such houses as "The Laurels", the unassuming natural surroundings of 1890s City agents, had by the 21st century turned out to be alluring Â£1 million or more homes in what it terms "financier land". 

Dwindle Bailey, in his examination "White Collars, Gray Lives" (1999), follows the beginnings of abstract enthusiasm for the lower-working classes to the "troubling irruption of another type of negligible middle class shop and office laborers" that confronted Victorian journalists in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The Grossmiths' "Journal" was a run of the mill parody of now is the right time; it tested the lower-white collar class lives of the Pooters and made jokes about their claims and negligible concerns. Tony Joseph calls the "Journal" "a sharp examination of social weakness". Albeit numerous authors had themselves originated from humble foundations, they frequently tried to camouflage their starting points through hatred: "putting the boot in on the lower working classes", says Bailey, "has for some time been the scholarly's blood sport". In any case, the 25 year following the distribution of "The Diary of a Nobody" saw a propensity to blend joke with compassion, even endorsement. In progress of scholars, for example, George Gissing, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett and E. M. Forster, characters developed who, in spite of the conspicuously Pooterish parts of their lives, were in no way, shape or form totally foolish. Bennett and Wells could make jokes about figures, for example, "Denry Machin", "Mr Polly" or "Mr Lewisham", while in the meantime praising their backbone, vitality and assurance to search for better things. In cases, for example, these, composes Bailey, "hate could change to adoration and national self-ID, as the Little ManÂ ... was transposed into Everyman, a model of sprightly strength in the midst of emergency." 

Amid the previous century, the invented journal has created as an acknowledged methods for comedic articulation; the first has, says Morton, "been rich ground which has developed numerous seeds". An early precedent is Anita Loos' tale of 1925: "Refined men Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady" in which the hero, Lorelei Lee, records her coy experience in exposition that "pursues the idiosyncrasies of conversational discourse" and recommends honesty or obliviousness yet, the pundit Elyse Graham watches, "vaudevilles, in abrading point of interest, the vernacular of the American white collar class". The journal kind turned out to be especially well known in the late twentieth century. In 1978â 81 Christopher Matthew delivered three volumes of journals recording the day by day life of "Simon Crisp", a lone wolf would-be man-about town of the period. The title of the main, "The Diary of a Somebody", is an immediate reference to the Grossmith unique. Assessing this volume in "The Spectator", Benny Green calls attention to a few parallels with the first, in both character and occasion. Matthew's book, says Green, is entertaining, however the Grossmiths' book is unrivaled; it is "influencing just as clever, such that the Matthew pastiche isn't". In 1982 came the primary appearance of Sue Townsend's adolescent creation, Adrian Mole, whose section into youthful masculinity and early middle age is diagrammed in a long arrangement of journals. The more moderately aged he moves toward becoming, says Morton, the more he takes after Pooter. 

Keith Waterhouse's "Mrs Pooter's Diary" of 1983 is an adjustment of the Grossmith unique that moves the account voice to Carrie Pooter. In 1996 Helen Fielding utilized the fanciful journal position for "Bridget Jones' Diary", which records the day by day gear of a solitary lady's life. The "New York Times" commentator composed that it "catches perfectly the manner in which current ladies waver between 'I am lady' freedom and an unfortunate girlie want to be everything to all men." This journal started as a week after week segment in "The Independent", and was later distributed in books which sold in excess of 15 million duplicates in 40 nations. During the 1990s the sarcastic magazine "Private investigator" ridiculed John Major, British executive 1990â 97, in "The Secret Diary of John Major matured 47", a mixture of the Adrian Mole journals with "The Diary of a Nobody", which made much fun of Major's lower-white collar class starting points. 

The social history specialist James Hammerton characterizes "Pooterism" as "the reliant shortcoming and expanded social demand of clerical laborers, built in the working environment yet communicated similarly as capably at home". Jon Wilde of "The Guardian" watches this trademark in various British TV satire manifestations of the late twentieth and mid 21st hundreds of years: Captain Mainwaring, Victor Meldrew, and "Peep Show"s Mark Corrigan are largely instances of characters "whose blinkered perspective on themselves is perpetually in sharp differentiation to how they are seen by the world". Charles Pooter, says Hammerton, was an allegory for lower working class claim, pretentiousness and pomposity, set up for joke by the "elites". Be that as it may, by the mid-twentieth century changes in the impression of manly jobs in lower white collar class society had smothered the joke, as men progressively grasped family life. Hammerton comments that the Grossmiths "would doubtlessly value the incongruity in observing highlights of the lower white collar class presence they derided so pitilessly turning into the more widespread model for twentieth century family life". Bailey comments on how the writer John Betjeman displayed the Pooters "not as objects of criticism but rather of jealousy, cozy and secure in their rural retreat". 

In September 1954 a phase form of the "Journal", by Basil Dean and Richard Blake, was displayed at London's Arts Theater with a cast that included George Benson and Dulcie Gray as the Pooters and Leslie Phillips as Lupin. Anthony Hartley, writing in "The Spectator", classed this creation as "reasonable for ordinary", with thoughtful exhibitions from the principals: "[I]t is a precondition of this sort of play that everyone concerned ought to show at least a bit of kindness of gold: just on account of Mr. Pooter's boss, Mr. Perkupp, do we really hear the metal chinking." 

In 1986 Waterhouse introduced an adjustment of his "Mrs Pooter" content at the Garrick Theater, with Judi Dench and Michael Williams. This adaptation was restored in 1993 at the Greenwich Theater in a generation by Matthew Francis. Clive Swift and Patricia Routledge played Charles and Carrie, in what Paul Taylor in "The Independent" portrayed as "basically a two-handerÂ ... in which the various people (counting Lupin Pooter, the uppish, stressing child) are either envisioned characters or, now and again, mimicked by the Pooters". 

In March 2011 the "Journal" was the subject of an even less customary generation at the Royal and Derngate Theater, Northampton. Adjusted by Hugh Osborne, with an all-male cast driven by Robert Daws, this guesses Pooter has masterminded his journals to be performed by novice on-screen characters. Quentin Letts of the "Day by day Mail" discovered this "a night of the absolute cleverest, quickest amusement I have seen for a considerable length of time". Lyn Gardner in "The Guardian" discovered it "a show of some appeal â however one that, as Pooter himself, does not exactly have the certifications to be so satisfied with itself". 

In 2014 a generation of the "Journal" was arranged in London by Rough Haired Pointer at the White Bear Theater and later exchanged to the King's Head Theater. This generation was restored at the King's |head in 2017; Time Out said of it: "It catches the first's sharp subtext, pointless mind and overwhelming incongruity, while likewise being, all around senseless". 

The main adjustment for screen was Ken Russell's short (40 minutes) film for the BBC film unit in 1964. Russell shot this in the style of the quiet movies of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, with the content described in a voice-over. The BBC screened two consequent adjustments: in 1979 a variant performed by Basil Boothroyd, and in 2007 a four-section sensation Andrew Davies, coordinated by Susanna White and first appeared on BBC Four as a component of the channel's Edwardian season. "The Guardian"s commentator composed of the last that Hugh Bonneville was "faultless as the disregarded kerfuffler [Pooter]." 

BBC Radio 4 (sound radio) has communicated a few performances of the "Journal". These incorporate Stephen Tompkinson and Annette Badland in a 2004 adjustment by Kelvin Segger, and Johnny Vegas and Katherine Parkinson in Andrew Lynch's 2012 adjustment. In March 2015, BBC Radio 4 Extra communicate a sound form of the 1986 Keith Waterhouse adjustment, featuring Judi Dench and Michael Williams.
