The tempest created from a tropical wave in the northern Gulf of Mexico on June 4, 2001, and struck the upper Texas coast presently. It floated northward through the state, swung back toward the south, and reappeared the Gulf of Mexico. The tempest proceeded toward the east-upper east, made landfall on Louisiana, at that point moved over the southeast United States and Mid-Atlantic. Allison was the main tempest since Tropical Storm Frances in 1998 to strike the northern Texas coastline.

Following the tempest, President George W. Bramble assigned 75 regions along Allison's way as hazardous situations, which empowered the natives influenced to apply for help. At that point the fourth-costliest Atlantic tropical typhoon and still the costliest Atlantic tropical violent wind that was never a noteworthy sea tempest, Allison was the principal Atlantic typhoon to have its name resigned while never having achieved sea tempest quality. 

A tropical wave got off the shoreline of Africa on May 21, 2001. It moved westbound over the Atlantic Ocean, holding little convection on its way. Subsequent to moving crosswise over South America and the southwestern Caribbean Sea, the wave entered the eastern North Pacific Ocean on June 1. A low-level dissemination created on June 2, while it was about 230Â miles (370Â km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. Southerly stream constrained the framework northward, and the wave moved inland on June 3. The low-level dissemination dispersed, however the mid-level flow persevered. It rose into the Gulf of Mexico on June 4, and grew profound convection on its eastern side. At an early stage June 5, satellite symbolism proposed that a tropical dejection was shaping in the northwest Gulf of Mexico, which was promoted by reports of wind blasts as high as 60Â mph (95Â km/h) only a couple of hundred feet over the surface, towards the east side of the framework. 

At 1200Â UTC on June 5, the aggravation built up an expansive, low-level course, and was named Tropical Storm Allison, the principal tempest of the 2001 Atlantic sea tempest season. Some heightening was anticipated, however it was required to be obstructed by cool seaward ocean surface temperatures. Because of the cool center nature of the inside, Allison at first contained subtropical qualities. Regardless of this, the tempest immediately reinforced to achieve top continued breezes of 60Â mph (95Â km/h), with typhoon compel twists stretching out up to 230Â miles (370Â km) east of the middle, and a base focal weight of 1000 mbar. The tempest at first moved practically nothing, and the nearness of a few little vortices from inside the profound convection caused trouble in deciding the accurate focus area. Later in the day, a few distinctive track gauges emerged. One situation had the twister following westbound into Mexico. Another anticipated the tempest moving east towards southern Louisiana. At the time, it was noticed that little downpour or wind persevered close to the inside, but instead toward the north and east. Under the directing flows of a subtropical edge that reached out in an eastâ west introduction over the southeast United States, Allison debilitated while nearing the Texas coastline, and struck close Freeport, Texas with 50Â mph (80Â km/h) winds. Inland, the tempest quickly debilitated, and the National Hurricane Center stopped warnings from the get-go June 6.

While the subtropical dejection moved eastbound, a new low dimension dissemination redeveloped toward the east, and Allison rapidly made landfall on Morgan City, Louisiana on June 11. At around a similar time, the surface focus improved toward the east-upper east of its past area, lining up with the mid-level course. Solid tempests redeveloped over the dissemination, and Allison fortified into a subtropical tempest over southeastern Louisiana.
