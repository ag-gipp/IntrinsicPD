It pursued the accomplishment of the band's 1993 "Children of Soul" collection and a break set apart by the individuals' individual melodic activities. 

For "Place of Music", Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! regrouped in 1995 and worked at studios in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, and Sacramento. Bassist and vocalist Raphael Saadiq, guitarist and vocalist D'wayne Wiggins, and percussionist/keyboardist Timothy Christian Riley chipped away at melodies for the collection autonomously before account them together as a gathering. The greater part of the collection was created by the gathering; the main melody to include outside generation was "How about we Get Down", by Saadiq and rapper/maker DJ Quik and G-One. 

Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! tried to underline musicianship instead of creation method amid the sessions. The record developed their past work's customary R&B impacts with live instrumentation and balladry. Music columnists have noticed the collection's fuse of conventional and contemporary sensibilities, subjects of adoration and sentiment, and clever, touchy verses. Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! named "Place of Music" after a little record store in the band's local city of Oakland, which Wiggins said they were helped to remember in the wake of tuning in to the collection. 

The collection diagrammed for 31 weeks on the "Bulletin" 200, topping at number 32, and was ensured Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It additionally gotten across the board recognition from pundits, who commended Tony! Toni! TonÃ©'s! musicianship and songwriting. A worldwide visit advancing "Place of Music" was arranged however did not appear in the midst of developing strains inside the gathering coming from imaginative contrasts. They disbanded soon after the collection's discharge to seek after discrete music professions. 

Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! accepting a break as a gathering after the business and basic accomplishment of their third collection "Children of Soul" (1993). As per vocalist and bassist Raphael Wiggins, every part had sought after individual music ventures, and "the gathering was attempting to make sense of where everyone's time, space and head was at." He, D'wayne Wiggins, and Timothy Christian Riley chipped away at songwriting and creation for other chronicle specialists amid the band's break, including D'Angelo, En Vogue, Karyn White, Tevin Campbell, and A Tribe Called Quest. Raphael Wiggins received the surname "Saadiq" for his expert name in 1994â"man of his statement" in Arabicâand discharged his performance single "Ask of You" in 1995. Their work outside the band prompted bits of gossip about a separation amid the time between collections, before regrouping to record "Place of Music". 

"Place of Music" was recorded in sessions that started in September 1995 and occurred at the accompanying California-based studios: Brillian Studios and Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco; Coda Studios and Grass Roots Studios in Oakland; Encore Studios, Image Recording, and Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles; and Pookie Labs and Woodshed Studios in Sacramento. 

Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! utilized vintage recording hardware and, for specific tracks, a 40-piece ensemble. A few tunes highlighted visitor artists, including rapper and maker DJ Quik, percussionist SheilaÂ E., and the Tower of Power horn area. Saadiq worked with DJ Quik on the tune "How about we Get Down" and said the joint effort demonstrated "common" on account of the maker's fondness for funk music. Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! needed to record the collection with an accentuation on musicianship instead of creation pizazz. Wiggins felt that the nonattendance of their once conspicuous synthesizers made the subsequent music sound increasingly particular. "On a great deal of the tunes, you can simply envision a five-piece band performing", he later told "USA Today". 

In contrast to the gathering's past collections, every part masterminded, formed, and created tunes alone before assembling the completed accounts for "Place of Music". As indicated by Saadiq, "what I did was compose a great deal of stuff and practice it for about a month, at that point recorded it live. At that point [Wiggins and Riley] would include their parts independently." He worked with his own chronicle group for "Place of Music", highlighting guitarist Chalmers "Spanky" Alford, drummer Tommy Branford, and keyboardists Kelvin Wooten and Cedric Draper. Wiggins trusted the band's break profited the account of "Place of Music", making them less inclined to deliver a collection subsidiary of "Children of Soul". 

The collection's opening track, the Al Green-styled "Considering You", was one that the gathering imagined and recorded together at 3 a.m. in Saadiq's Pookie Labs studio. As he recollected that it, "I was simply playing near and begun singing off the highest point of my head. I never recorded anything, it was exactly what turned out." "Annie May", one of Wiggins' melodies for "Place of Music", had Saadiq's supporting vocals pre-recorded and after that overdubbed to the track's last blend. 

Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! finished account "Place of Music" in September 1996. The collection was then aced by Brian Gardner at the Bernie Grundman Mastering studio in Hollywood. One of Saadiq's melodies for the collection, "Me and the Blind Man", was avoided from the last blend in light of the fact that, as Saadiq told "Yippee! Music", "they didn't need anyone playing top choices, so one of my melodies needed to fall off." The chronicle was an ill humored blues piece with surrealistic verses about desire, yearning, and an imaginary visually impaired man's mystery powers. Saadiq needed to indicate "a darker sideÂ ... some profundity" to audience members with the melody. "To me melodies like 'Daze Man,' make the entire sound, the "Place of Music"", he commented. It was highlighted on a collection sampler sent by the gathering's mark to music writers. 

"Place of Music" developed Tony! Toni! TonÃ©'s! past conventional R&B-impacted work by accentuating live instrumentation and numbers. In the supposition of "Day by day Herald" author Dan Kening, the collection proceeded with the band's blend of contemporary R&B and out-dated soul, esteeming it "a large portion of a tribute to their '60s and '70s soul music roots and a large portion of a stunning mix of current smooth balladeering and danceable funk." "Salon" pundit Jennie Yabroff trusted "Place of Music" for the most part highlighted ditties as "moderate, passionate numbers with quieted beats" that complemented the verses. As indicated by "Drum" magazine, mid-rhythm melodies, for example, "Considering You" and "Still a Man" depended unequivocally on 1960s R&B/soul "given a contemporary face", while up-beat tunes, for example, "Lovin' You", "Don't Fall in Love", and "We should Get Down" had components of funk. 

The verses on "Place of Music" were depicted by a few writers as clever and touchy. Michaelangelo Matos of the "Chicago Reader" described Saadiq's songwriting as fun loving and idiosyncratic, while contrasting his tenor performing voice with that of a youthful Michael Jackson. On Wiggins' songwriting style, Matos said his tunes and rhythms were more inconspicuous than those of Saadiq and watched "polished obbligatos, quieted burr, and starry-peered toward falsetto" in Wiggins' singing. Saadiq rotated with Wiggins as lead vocalist for the collection. Richard Torres of "Newsday" credited the gathering's verses on the collection to their "[belief] in the influence of affection and the bait of sentiment." 

As per Saadiq, the opening track "Considering You" is "a truly soul, southern, crazy tune" roused by Al Green. It has light guitar strokes and is sung in a Southern twang by Saadiq, while "First rate" highlights jazz components and the vocalist's lively guarantee of a trek to Denny's for "the most costly supper we can discover". On "Still a Man", he sings from the point of view of a man who was left by his significant other to bring up their kids alone. The sponsorship vocalists sing the thoughtful snare, "Have you at any point cherished someone/Who adores you so much it harms you to hurt them so awful?" On "Blessed Smokes and Gee Whiz", Saadiq's more established sibling Randall Wiggins sings lead. It was depicted by "Washington City Paper" columnist Rickey Wright as a modernized variant of the Stylistics' 1972 tune "Betcha by Golly, Wow", including "a dead-on impression of Russell Thompkins' obvious falsetto and exact phrasing". 

"Annie May" was composed by Wiggins as a tale about a "decent young lady adjacent" who turns into an extraordinary artist, while "Let Me Know" is an adoration melody with Wall of Sound components. As per Nick Krewen of "The Spectator", "Wild Child" is "a ditty in the stupendous sense" of the 1977 Earth, Wind and Fire melody "Be Ever Wonderful". "Gathering Don't Cry" is a reflection on mortality with lively, philosophical suggestions. Wright trusted the tune "communicates an obvious otherworldliness unheard in the Tonyies' past tunes". The end track is a gospel-affected instrumental and variety of "Lovin' You" created by Saadiq. Its sole verse, as per Wright, is a universalist maxim. 

"Place of Music" was named after a record store in the band's local Oakland, which had shut quite a while before the collection's discharge. In a meeting for "Announcement", Wiggins stated, "We title every one of our collections toward the finish of the undertaking. We sat back and tuned in to everything, and it helped us to remember this mother and-pop store around our way in Oakland." "We experienced childhood in a place of music," Wiggins kept, commenting how their dad was a blue guitarist and music unifyingly affected individuals. As indicated by "Billboard"s Shawnee Smith, the collection's title portrayed a changed, total work unmistakable from a contemporary music advertise oversaturated by "retro-soul gatherings". 

The collection's spread and booklet photographs were taken by picture taker William Claxton, who caught Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! wearing easygoing and formal, retro garments. This takeoff from the more outrÃ© closet of the band's past was translated by writer Brandon Ousley as a push to advance "the style of 1960s-time Black America and incredible soul acts to a cutting edge age". 

"Place of Music" was discharged on November 19, 1996, by Mercury Records. The mark arranged the discharge date to harmonize with the pinnacle Christmas shopping period and ran advertisement crusades booked for system link, syndicated TV programs, and radio stations. "Place of Music" achieved number 32 on the "Board" 200 and went through 31 weeks on the graph. In its initial two months, the collection sold 318,502 duplicates in the US. Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! initiated its discharge with a satellite question and answer session and in-store execution at a little retail outlet in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! played out the tune on the sketch satire show "All That"; on the music assortment program "Soul Train", they played out "How about we Get Down" and "Annie May". "Considering You" was discharged as the second single on March 11, 1997, by which time "Place of Music" had sold 514,000 duplicates, as indicated by Nielsen SoundScan. On August 6, the collection was affirmed Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). 

After "Place of Music" was discharged, Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! experienced developing strains coming from innovative contrasts, business-related issues, and Saadiq's enthusiasm for a performance vocation. "There's a calm worry between us that nobody truly discusses", Saadiq told "Vibe" in 1997. "Also, what's miserable about the entire thing is the way that our companionship is breaking down. Who knows, "Place of Music" could be the last Tony Toni TonÃ© collection." The band stayed focused on advancing the record into 1997, including a February 28 taped execution at VH1's "Hard Rock Live" unique. As per Mercury VP Marty Maidenberg, a global visit for the collection had been arranged by October 1996, with show dates in Japan and the United Kingdom, however it never appeared. In November 1997, Saadiq told the "Philadelphia Daily News" "there ought to have been similar to four singles from that collection. You'll need to call Mercury on that. It ran Platinum with no special visit. We carried out our responsibility and they profited." The gathering disbanded in a matter of seconds a while later, and every part proceeded to seek after an individual music vocation. 

Surveying "Place of Music" in "Stimulation Weekly", Ken Tucker discovered Tony! Toni! TonÃ©'s! impersonations of great sounds "shrewd, once in a while splendid", "clever", and "massively affable", with "another common subject: what makes a man a man and a lady a lady, investigated with both straightforwardness and cleverness". Sonia Murray of "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution" hailed it as the band's most efficacious and multifaceted record yet, while "Chicago Tribune" commentator Greg Kot said "they discover bliss that is saturated with reality as opposed to in the upwardly versatile dream devised by numerous individuals of the present less custom cognizant R&B crooners." "The Tonies fill in as a kind of elaborate missing connection", J. D. Considine wrote in "The Baltimore Sun", "proposing what might have happened had the spirit styles of the '70s kept on advancing, rather than being hurled aside by the synth-driven sound of the '80s". Michael A. Gonzales from "Vibe" said the collection "shines a dream of darkness that is superbad, frantic smooth, and insane hot". He portrayed it as "a wonderland of consonant enjoyments, softcore jollies, and moderate jam fever drifting on the tip of Cupid's bolt", demonstrating the gathering "investigating the arousing quality of dark fly without seeming like lane menaces stalking their objects of want". 

"Place of Music" was casted a ballot the 30th best collection of 1996 in "The Village Voice"s Pazz and Jop survey, which surveyed 236 American pundits across the country. Robert Christgau, the survey's chief, positioned it tenth all alone year-end list. In his survey for the paper, he regarded "Considering You" a "humorously gutsy" and spot-on Al Green tribute while composing of the collection: 

By and large, Christgau ascribed the collection's prosperity to Saadiq's lead job in Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! He fought that "just with "Place of Music" did they become genuine children of the spirit recovery, the most practiced r&b demonstration of the '90s. That is as yet the collection to recall them by." AllMusic proofreader Leo Stanley later commented that the gathering "effectively achieve their combination of the customary and contemporaryÂ ... inside the structure of vital, appealing melodies" obliged to both old and current R&B songwriting ideals. As indicated by Stanley, the record had an impact on contemporary neo soul craftsmen, for example, Tony Rich and Maxwell. As Matos would like to think, the collection exhibited the expanding aesthetic difference among Saadiq and Wiggins, which "had developed so articulated that the pressure just upgraded what was at that point the gathering's best clump of tunes". Rashod Ollison of "The Virginian-Pilot" viewed the record as "a faultless jewel" on which the band's "amalgamation of customary and contemporary styles blended flawlessly". In "The Rolling Stone Album Guide" (2004), Fred Schruers said ""House of Music" combines the triumph of "Children of Soul" for an artful culmination of 1990s R&B, a collection that is as saturated with soul convention as anything by Maxwell or D'Angelo, however that blends the praise with diversion and deft contemporary contacts, in this way making another space all its own".
