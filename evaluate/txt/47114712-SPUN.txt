They can see those in front of them strolling through the "divider" framing the passage to Platform . This impact utilizes the Pepper's apparition dream. In the wake of proceeding around a few corners, visitors touch base on Platform to hang tight for the following train. After the Hogwarts Express has switched into Platform and the arriving travelers have landed, the following travelers enter one of the twenty-one compartments in the three traveler mentors. 

As the train leaves King's Cross, the video succession in the compartments begins with Hedwig the owl flying close by while going through the edges of London.

He expressed: "It's moved toward becoming tradition for amusement park attractions to drop you off at or close to a similar point where you boarded the ride, so it's somewhat muddling when you leave the Hogwarts Express and find that you're not just in an alternate train stationÂ âyou're in an alternate amusement park." 

Arthur Levine from "About.com" was baffled that Universal had not attempted to re-make the mysterious part of visitors entering Platform : "When it's an ideal opportunity to make their own specific manner to the stage, notwithstanding, it seems to would-be wizards that they are just entering an obscured hallway. Beside a capable of being heard "whoosh" sound, there is, unfortunately, no endeavor to replicate the supernatural, particle moving wonder." He likewise thought that it was clumsy that the Hogwarts Express inverts into Platform at King's Crossâin spite of the fact that in Hogsmeade the train arrives confronting advances. By and large Levine said that the fascination accomplishes something other than making it a ride: "By making it a fundamental and convincing piece of The Wizarding World, most visitors would need to ride it to get the total Potter understanding. By making it a between park ride and requiring a two-park ticket to load up it, Universal will unquestionably help up-pitch significantly more clients to higher-valued passes, energize multi-day visits, increment interest for its on-property inns, and drive business at its CityWalk feasting/shopping/amusement area".
