The songwriting and singing of Johns had advanced relentlessly while the band had built up an expanded component of multifaceted nature. In 2003, after the arrival of "Diorama", the band reported a rest, amid which time individuals recorded with side ventures The Dissociatives, The Mess Hall, and Tambalane.

As young people, vocalist guitarist Johns and drummer Gillies, began playing music together â in one class they constructed a phase out of work areas and played rap tunes for their classmates. When they proceeded onward to Newcastle High School, a kindred understudy, Chris Joannou, joined the pair on low register guitar.

For the video's communicated, they had changed their name to Silverchair (styled as silverchair until 2002). In a 1994 meeting with Melbourne magazine "Buzz", the band asserted the name got from a radio solicitation for "Fragment" by Nirvana and "Berlin Chair" by You Am I being stirred up as Silver Chair. It was later uncovered they were named for the C. S. Lewis-wrote novel "The Silver Chair" from "The Chronicles of Narnia" arrangement.

He uncovered that his eating issues created from the season of "Monstrosity Show" and when "Neon Ballroom" was composed he "loathed music, truly every little thing about it", yet felt that he "couldn't quit doing it; I felt like a captive to it." Johns looked for treatment and medicine however felt "It's simpler for me to express it through music and verses". 

Silverchair included an assistant keyboardist, Sam Holloway (ex-Cordrazine), for the Neon Ballroom Tour. The US leg had the gathering playing with The Offspring and Red Hot Chili Peppers, while Silverchair's voyage through UK and European had The Living End as the help demonstration.

In November 2000, after the gathering had left the mark, Sony issued "The Best of Volume 1" without the band's contribution. Johns denied the arrangement, "We contemplated putting out advertisements in the road press to make individuals mindful that we weren't embracing it, however that would have made a huge deal about the entire thing ... On the off chance that individuals need to get it, they can get it however I wouldn't get it on the off chance that I was a silverchair fan." 

In June 2001, Silverchair entered a studio in Sydney with maker David Bottrill (Tool, Peter Gabriel, King Crimson) to begin deal with their fourth collection, "Diorama". Johns formally expected the job of a co-maker. The collection name signifies "a world inside a world". Most tracks originated from Johns' freshly discovered strategy for composing material on a piano, a system he created amid the band's break after "Neon Ballroom". 

So as to finish the vision for "Diorama", a few different performers added to the collection, including Van Dyke Parks, who gave instrumental plans to "Fish in the Brine", "Luv Your Life", and "Over the Night". Paul Mac (from Itch-E and Scratch-E) and Jim Moginie (from Midnight Oil) both on piano additionally worked together with the band. While recording "Diorama", Johns alluded to himself as a craftsman, instead of just being in a "musical crew". Upon its discharge, commentators remarked that the collection was more aesthetic than past works.

Following the 2002 ARIA Awards, the band reported an uncertain break. Johns said it was fundamental "given the reality the band were as one for over 10 years but then were just, by and large, 23Â years old". From March to June 2003, Silverchair attempted the Across the Night Tour to perform "Diorama". The place where they grew up execution on 19 April was recorded as "Live from Faraway Stables" for a 2ÃCD and 2xDVD discharged in November.

The 2004 Boxing Day torrent brought about the WaveAid gathering pledges show held in January 2005: Silverchair performed to help raise assets for help associations working in a fiasco influenced territories. Because of WaveAid the band chose to continue cooperating. Gillies clarified the band's get-together as because of an uncommon "science" between band individuals, telling "The Sydney Morning Herald", "It just took us 15Â years, yet as of late we've understood, 'We've truly got something extraordinary and we should simply take the plunge.'" 

Subsequent to performing at Wave Aid, Silverchair rejoined and by late 2005 started arrangements for their next studio collection, "Youthful Modern". Johns had expounded on 50 tunes amid the rest for a conceivable solo collection or other undertaking however chose to utilize them for Silverchair.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2008 both Silverchair and Powderfinger won 'Best Music DVD' for "Over the Great Divide", for Silverchair this was their 21st success from 49 selections. 

As indicated by Silverchair's site, as of June 2009, the gathering had started chip away at the follow-up to "Youthful Modern", they had gone through three weeks recording in Australia with future sessions reserved for soon thereafter. No discharge date was set, yet the band transferred in-studio recordings of them chipping away at a few tracks to their official site. In December, Johns brought in to Triple J's morning meal appear, "Robbie, Marieke and The Doctor", and talked about the band's new collection which they were chipping away at in Newcastle. He let them know "the fundamental distinction is there's a ton of experimentation with instruments and synths... I believe there's solitary guitar on four melodies out of fifty up until this point," however included the new material is "shockingly rough given there's no guitar." In April 2010, through the band's site, Joannou reported that they would perform two new tunes called "16" and "Machina Collecta" at May's Groovin the Moo celebration. He said work was advancing great and affirmed there was, up 'til now, no title for the proposed collection and that they were basically alluding to it as "Collection No.Â 6". The last show of the celebration was at Bunbury on 15 May. By the end of the year, take a shot at the collection had halted as every part sought after different interests. 

On 25 May 2011, Silverchair reported an inconclusive rest: 

"Sydney Morning Herald"s music essayist, Bernard Zuel, said the band's utilization of "inconclusive hibernation" was an approach to mellow the blow of the gathering's separation for fans; he anticipated future reunions and exhibitions for admirable motivation. By June, Gillies was in the last phases of about 12Â months of taking a shot at his performance collection and he said that it was anything but a continuation of his prior work with Tambalane. In October, Johns was chipping away at the soundtrack for "My Mind's Own Melody" â a short film. In May 2012 Johns recorded the new hymn for Qantas titled 'Chart book.' It is the principal bit of business music Johns has made. 

The individuals from Silverchair have expressed that they have not discounted a get-together. Gillies has said that there are plans to discharge another Silverchair collection, which was nearly completed before the rest. 

Silverchair are commonly named an elective shake and grunge band, in spite of the fact that their dependability to explicit classifications has changed as they have developed. A significant part of the band's initial grunge and post-grunge work was roused by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Black Sabbath. As indicated by Australian shake music history specialist Ian McFarlane, ""frogstomp" caught the rhythm of the occasions with its blend of Soundgarden/Pearl Jam/Bush post-grunge commotion and adolescent melodious tension." 

In their initial years the apparent complex similitudes prompted Silverchair being mockingly named as 'silverhighchair', 'not Soundgarden but rather ' or 'Nirvana in Pajamas' by the Australian media. The last is a snide conflated reference to the band's childhood and the well known Australian kids' TV arrangement "Bananas in Pajamas". McFarlane expressed ""Freak Show" and tracks like 'Oddity' were solidly in Nirvana region with a trace of Led Zeppelin's Eastern supernatural quality". Gillies noticed that the band were propelled by the Seattle Sound, just as The Beatles and The Doors, and were very naive in their childhood. Johns conceded that "We were constantly impacted a great deal by Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin for some odd reason we weren't truly adept at playing that style of music. So we were placed in the entire grunge classification since it was such a carport y, overwhelming music term." 

Australian shake music columnist Ed Nimmervoll felt that Johns "had never expected to utilize his issues for motivation, yet at last the music was simply the most ideal approach to unburden. 'Neon Ballroom' took a half year to record. The collection's enthusiasm and melodic complexity demonstrated to the world that silverchair were a power to be figured with". As indicated by "100 Best Australian Albums", by three individual columnists, John O'Donnell, Toby Creswell and Craig Mathieson, "Neon Ballroom"s lead-in track, "Feeling Sickness", depicted Johns' life during the 1990s and "tended to [his] want to move past the imitative hints of Silverchair's initial two collections ... furthermore, make something new and unique". "Ana's Song (Open Fire)" legitimately focussed on his dietary issue; "[it] turned into a hit everywhere throughout the world and opened up for talk the way that guys could likewise be influenced by anorexia." 

Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt "Diorama" "was an incredibly imaginative and great advance forward that demonstrated the band shedding its grunge past and including horns, strings, and develop verses to its munititions stockpile." Fellow Allmusic commentator Bradley Torreano noticed that "they some way or another continued onward and continued improving ... Silverchair has grown up and assembled a fine blend of symphonic pop and shake on Diorama." Bernard Zuel depicted how the "Diorama" show visit denoted a move from hard shake towards workmanship shake: "they ventured out of the fields and outbuildings and 'got tasteful' ... at last having confessed to harboring creative aspiration (a very un-Australian band activity), they've demonstrated they have the capacity". 

Recorded as a hard copy "Youthful Modern", Johns attempted to make the music sound basic, notwithstanding an intricate melodic structure. The verses were composed after the music was made, now and then as late as the day of chronicle. As Johns fears composing verses, he recommended that the band could deliver an instrumental collection at some phase later on. Johns is the band's essential musician, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies don't have critical effect on what he composes, they are vital to the band's general sound. For that collection, Hamilton co-composed four melodies with Johns including the APRA Award-winning "Straight Lines". Joannou trusted that "Youthful Modern" was less difficult than "Diorama" however "still as mind boggling underneath with basic pop tune components". He said that a significant part of the band's prosperity came about because of attempting to propel themselves harder in chronicle and composing. Self-delivering has enabled the band to do as such without the weights of a record name. 

Gillies takes note of that Silverchair will frequently "risk losing fans" with their work, and this was obvious in the adjustments in melodic course in "Diorama" and "Youthful Modern". In any case, he depicted this as something to be thankful for, portraying the reality "that we haven't been categorized, and individuals truly don't have a clue what's in store" as one of the appealing components of the band. Regardless of the good and bad times of progress at a youthful age, Gillies says the band "acknowledge what we've accomplished and what we have" in their professions. The band have gotten six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting grants at the 2008 function. 

"Frogstomp" was depicted as like Nirvana and Pearl Jam; Erlewine noticed that it followed in "the elective shake convention" of those groups. Erlewine likewise expressed that "their songwriting capacities aren't as solid" as those of their companions. In any case, "Moving Stone" asserted that the band had transcended their friends, praising Johns' "worn out vocals". "Envoy Sun" writer Nue Te Koha lauded "Frogstomp" for "breaking the dry season of Australian music having an effect abroad". Be that as it may, he felt "It is exceedingly far from being obviously true whether the three youngsters have gone to the world with another sound or something recognizably Australian ... Silverchair's picture and sound are obtrusively ... Nirvana meets Pearl Jam". Nimmervoll questioned Te Koha's view, "It's not unique, it's not Australian. Bah, hoax ... It's similarly too Britain didn't state something very similar when The Beatles reevaluated American R&B". 

"Oddity Show" saw the band show their very own greater amount melodic style, as opposed to duplicating others, and along these lines got more recognition for its songwriting than its antecedent. Hurray! Music's Sandy Masuo depicted the verses as "moving" and "enthusiastic". Johns' vocal conveyance was supplemented: his "ambivalent, crackly voice beat the sufficient power chordage ... [he] hits shivery, passionate notes that pass on both sweet optimism and frustration". Zuel felt that with this collection, the band "have outgrown the jokes, expectations and their very own downplayed high school aspirations to discover they have progressed toward becoming (pant!) profession performers." 

In "100 Best Australian Albums" (2010) their third collection, "Neon Ballroom", was put at No.Â 25 as per its creators. "Amusement Weekly" endorsed of the further progression in "Neon Ballroom", remarking on "extravagant strings on these grown-up courses of action". There were by and by noteworthy progressions in songwriting; Johns was depicted as "enraged, roused, and all adult". In any case, "Moving Stone" said the collection appeared to be confounded, remarking that Silverchair "can't choose what they need to do" with their music. In the mean time, "Diorama" was viewed as an expansion of the band's inventiveness, with its "[h]eavy coordination, capricious melodic movements and an unconventional pop reasonableness". As indicated by PopMatters' Nikki Tranter, the collection emerged in a generally dull Australian music showcase. 

Allmusic's Clayton Bolger depicted "Youthful Modern" as an improvement by the band, commending "snappy melodic snares, propelled expressive subjects, and dazzling string courses of action". He asserted the collection was the apex of the band's advancement. PopMatters' Nick Pearson saw the inverse, guaranteeing that "[o]nce you achieve the dimension of scholarly development where you can differentiate between obscure however wonderful verses and irrational poo, you have outgrown Silverchair". Pearson considered the collection an endeavor to verify a more secure region and guarantee deals, after the accomplishment of past works, calling it more exhausting than its antecedents. Different commentators noted impacts from faction British band XTC. 

In July 2009 "Tomorrow" was casted a ballot number 33 by the Australian open in Triple J's Hottest 100 ever. As of January 2018, the gathering have sold 9 million collections around the world. At the yearly ARIA Music Awards, Silverchair holds the record for the most assigned craftsman, with 49, and the most number of honors won, with 21. Their leap forward year was in 1995, when they won five out of nine assignments, including 'Best New Talent', and 'Achievement Artist' for both collection and single classifications. Their best year was at the 2007 service when they won six of eight designations.
