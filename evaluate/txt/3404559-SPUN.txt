Oryzomys 

Oryzomys is a variety of semiaquatic rodents in the clan Oryzomyini living in southern North America and far northern South America. It incorporates eight species, two of whichâthe swamp rice rodent ("O.Â palustris") of the United States and "O.Â couesi" of Mexico and Central Americaâare across the board; the six others have progressively limited disseminations. The species have had exciting ordered narratives, and most species were at one time incorporated into the swamp rice rodent; extra species might be perceived later on. The name "Oryzomys" was set up in 1857 by Spencer Fullerton Baird for the bog rice rodent and was before long connected to over a hundred types of American rodents. Thusly, the class bit by bit turned out to be all the more barely characterized until its present substance were set up in 2006, when ten new genera were built up for species recently set in "Oryzomys". 

Types of "Oryzomys" are medium-sized rodents with long, coarse hide. The upperparts are dim to ruddy and the underparts white to buff. The creatures have expansive feet with diminished or missing ungual tufts of hair around the hooks and, in probably a few animal types, with webbing between the toes. The platform (front piece of the skull) is wide and the braincase is high. Both the swamp rice rodent and "O.Â couesi" have 56Â chromosomes, do not have a nerve bladder, and have an unpredictable penis (as is normal for the Sigmodontinae) with certain attributes that are uncommon among oryzomyines; these qualities are obscure in different types of this variety. 

The living space incorporates different sorts of wetlands, for example, lakes, swamps, and streams. "Oryzomys" species swim well, are dynamic amid the night, and eat both plant and creature sustenance. They construct woven homes of vegetation. After an incubation time of 21 to 28Â days, around four youthful are conceived. Types of "Oryzomys" are tainted by various parasites and convey somewhere around three hantaviruses, one of which (Bayou infection) likewise contaminates people. Two, perhaps three, species have become wiped out in the course of the most recent two centuries and somewhere around one other is imperiled, yet the far reaching swamp rice rodent and "O.Â couesi" are not compromised. 

"Oryzomys" is one of around thirty genera inside the clan Oryzomyini, a different gathering of well over a hundred animal varieties, a considerable lot of which were once in the past likewise incorporated into "Oryzomys". Oryzomyini is one of a few clans inside the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, which incorporates several different types of chiefly little rodents, dispersed fundamentally in the Americas and Eurasia. 

Inside Oryzomyini, a 2006 phylogenetic investigation by Marcelo Weksler which utilized both morphological and DNA succession information discovered some proof that "Oryzomys" is most firmly identified with a gathering including "Holochilus", "Lundomys", and "Pseudoryzomys". In spite of the fact that investigations dependent on morphological and joined information upheld this relationship, groupings of the "Rbp3" quality alone rather put "Oryzomys" among a gathering that included "Nectomys", "Sigmodontomys", and a couple of other genera. In all examinations, "Oryzomys" showed up inside clade D of Oryzomyini. The connection among "Oryzomys" and the "Holochilus" assemble was upheld by five synapomorphies (shared inferred characters)â nonappearance or decrease of both the hypothenar and interdigital cushions; decrease of ungual tufts of hairs encompassing the paws; having the back edge of the zygomatic plate of the skull at a similar dimension as the front of the principal upper molar; and the anterocone (front cusp) of the main upper molar partitioned by an anteromedian fossette. The initial three are adjustments to the semiaquatic way of life that "Oryzomys" and the individuals from the "Holochilus" amass share, and may subsequently be instances of concurrent development. 

The name "Oryzomys" was presented in 1857 by Spencer Fullerton Baird for the swamp rice rodent (presently "Oryzomys palustris") of the eastern United States, which had been first depicted twenty years sooner by Richard Harlan. The name joins the Greek "oryza" "rice" and "mys" "mouse" and alludes to the encouraging propensities for the bog rice rodent. Baird set "Oryzomys" as a subgenus of the now-old family "Hesperomys" and included just the swamp rice rodent in it, a grouping which was trailed by Elliott Coues in 1874 and 1877. In 1890, "Oryzomys" was raised to conventional position, and in ensuing years various extra species were credited to it, a considerable lot of which were before long moved to isolate genera. In the 1898 "Catalogus Mammalium", Ãdouard Louis Trouessart recorded 67Â species of "Oryzomys", including some that are currently put in "Calomys", "Necromys", "Thomasomys", and other genera random to "Oryzomys". A portion of the new genera proposed were before long subsumed in "Oryzomys" once more, and in "The Families and Genera of Living Rodents" (1941), John Ellerman recorded "Microryzomys", "Oligoryzomys", "Melanomys", "Nesoryzomys", and "Oecomys" as equivalent words of "Oryzomys" and included about 127Â species in it. In 1948, Philip Hershkovitz proposed that different oryzomyines like "Nectomys" and "Megalomys" could also be incorporated into "Oryzomys", and Clayton Ray pursued this recommendation in 1962. 

Hershkovitz and Ray's order was never generally pursued, and from 1976 on creators began to restore a portion of different gatherings lumped in "Oryzomys" as independent genera. The variety was decreased to 43Â species (out of 110 in Oryzomyini) in the third version (2005) of "Well evolved creature Species of the World", however it was as yet not a characteristic, monophyletic gathering; rather, it generally joined those oryzomyines that came up short on the obvious specializations of other genera. In 2006, Marcelo Weksler's complete phylogenetic examination created additional proof that the class was polyphyletic, as types of "Oryzomys" were scattered everywhere throughout the oryzomyine tree. He suggested that eleven new genera ought to be made to oblige those species that were not firmly identified with the sort types of "Oryzomys", the bog rice rodent; he considered different choices that would require less new genera, yet contended that that would result in less important variety level gatherings in Oryzomyini. Later around the same time, Weksler, Percequillo, and Voss made ten new generaâ"Aegialomys", "Cerradomys", "Eremoryzomys", "Euryoryzomys", "Hylaeamys", "Mindomys", "Nephelomys", "Oreoryzomys", "Sooretamys", and "Transandinomys"â for species earlier put in "Oryzomys" and put six additional species identified with ""Oryzomys" alfaroi" in "Handleyomys" pending the depiction of all the more new genera for them. They left just five species in "Oryzomys", which was presently at last a characteristic, monophyletic gathering. As a result of consequent ordered work, the quantity of species has since expanded to no less than eight. 

A few issues remain: ?"Oryzomys pliocaenicus", a Miocene fossil from Kansas, is of unsure personality yet may have a place in "Bensonomys", and fossils from the Miocene of Oregon and Pliocene of New Mexico have likewise been credited to "Oryzomys", however presumably mistakenly. A conceivable "Oryzomys" has been recorded from the Irvingtonian (Pleistocene) of Saskatchewan. 

The present idea of "Oryzomys" gets from the "palustris-mexicanus" aggregate perceived inside an a lot bigger sort "Oryzomys" by Merriam (1901) and the "palustris" amass proposed by Goldman (1918). Merriam perceived 21Â species inside his gathering, however Goldman merged them into eightâthe swamp rice rodent in the United States, "O.Â couesi" in far southern Texas, Mexico, and Central America, and six others with little appropriations. In 1960, Raymond Hall joined "O.Â couesi" and the bog rice rodent into a solitary animal types, "Oryzomys palustris", and from that point, other limited structures were additionally incorporated into "O.Â palustris". Hershkovitz depicted another species in the gathering, "O.Â gorgasi" from Colombia, in 1970 and the following year he noticed that "O.Â dimidiatus", recently named a "Nectomys", was like "O.Â palustris". After 1979, the swamp rice rodent and "O.Â couesi" were again viewed as discrete because of further work in Texas, where their reaches meet. While checking on "O.Â gorgasi" in 2001, J. SÃ¡nchez H. what's more, partners reclassified and described the "O.Â palustris" gathering and recorded "O.Â couesi", "O.Â dimidiatus", "O.Â gorgasi", and the bog rice rodent as its individuals; Guy Musser and Michael Carleton in the 2005 third release of "Warm blooded animal Species of the World" furthermore recorded "O.Â nelsoni" from MarÃ­a Madre Island in western Mexico. 

In 2006, Weksler and partners pursued the 2001 definition by SÃ¡nchez and others for the confined sort "Oryzomys", yet included "O.Â antillarum" from Jamaica as an animal categories. Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales surveyed "Oryzomys" from western Mexico in 2009 and in this setting gave an all-inclusive finding of "Oryzomys". They perceived eight species: the six recently referenced in addition to "O.Â albiventer" and "O.Â peninsulae". Likewise in 2009, Robert Voss and Weksler distinguished the subfossil "Oryzomys curasoae" from CuraÃ§ao as an island populace of "O.Â gorgasi". The following year, Delton Hanson and partners distributed an examination utilizing DNA arrangement information from the cytochrome "b", interphotoreceptor retinoid-restricting protein, and liquor dehydrogenase 1 qualities to evaluate connections inside "Oryzomys". They suggested that the bog rice rodent be part into two species and that "O.Â couesi" be part into four species based on the watched succession difference and other information. 

Merriam partitioned his "palustris-mexicanus" amass in two "arrangement" as per the shade of the underparts (white or fulvous). Goldman partitioned his "palustris" assemble in two "areas"â a "couesi" segment with "O.Â couesi" and six related species, and a "palustris" segment with "O.Â palustris" as it were. He noticed that the last varied from the previous in the for the most part darker, increasingly tanish, longer hide, and bigger sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the mesopterygoid fossa, the hole behind the finish of the sense of taste). As Weksler's 2006 investigation included just "O.Â couesi" and the bog rice rodent among types of "Oryzomys" in the severe sense, he couldn't test those gatherings. Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales agreed with Goldman's division, posting extra characters, and noticed that the "palustris" gathering might be more semiaquatically adjusted than the individuals from the "couesi" bunch are. In the last mentioned, the hide is generally ruddy darker, rather than grayish-darker in the "palustris" gathering. Individuals from the "couesi" aggregate have littler sphenopalatine vacuities and a littler sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (opening) in the side of the skull over the molars, and an all the more very created anterolabial cingulum on the third lower molar (a peak at the front of the tooth). The hypothenar cushion of the hindfoot, situated on the bottom a long way from the fingers, is available in the "couesi" gathering, however missing in the "palustris" gathering. Interdigital webbing might be all the more exceptionally created in the "palustris" gathering. Utilizing morphological information, Voss and Weksler found a closer connection among "O.Â couesi" and "O.Â gorgasi" to the avoidance of "O.Â palustris", however with low certainty. The DNA arrangement information of Hanson and associates upheld a profound partition between the "palustris" and "couesi" gatherings, however a Costa Rican test (doled out to "O.Â couesi") was about as removed from the two gatherings as they were from one another. 

The sort as of now incorporates the accompanying species: 

"Oryzomys" contains medium-sized, semiaquatically specific oryzomyine rodents. They have long, coarse hide that is grayish to ruddy on the upperparts and white to buff on the underparts. The swamp rice rodent externally takes after the presented species dark rodent and darker rodent, yet has bigger contrasts in shading between the upper-and underparts. The vibrissae (bristles) are short and the ears are little and very much haired. The tail is as a rule as long as or longer than the head and body and is scantily haired, however the hairs on the lower side are longer than those above. Females have eight mammae, as in many oryzomyines. The hindfeet are expansive and have the first and fifth digits eminently shorter than the center three. The upper surface is bristly, yet the underside is exposed and secured with little abnormalities (squamae). The cushions are commonly ineffectively created, just like the ungual tufts. Interdigital webbing might be available, yet its advancement is variable inside the family. 

The karyotype has been recorded in different populaces of the bog rice rodent and "O.Â couesi" and is clearly steady inside the sort at 56Â chromosomes, with the major number of chromosomal arms going from 56 to 60 (2nÂ =Â 56, FNÂ =Â 56â 60). In the two species, the stomach has the trademark example of sigmodontines (unilocular-hemiglandular): it isn't part in two chambers by an incisura angularis and the front part (antrum) is secured by a glandular epithelium. Besides, the nerve bladder is missing, a synapomorphy of Oryzomyini. 

"Oryzomys" species have an expansive skull with a short platform and high braincase. The interorbital district, situated between the eyes, is tightest to the front and is flanked by all around created dots at its edges. The zygomatic plate is wide and has a very much created zygomatic score at its front. The zygomatic curve is hearty and contains a little yet unmistakable jugal bone. The interparietal bone, some portion of the top of the braincase, is thin and short; its thinness is a synapomorphy for "O.Â couesi" in addition to the swamp rice rodent as indicated by Weksler's examination. The sharp foramina are long, with their back edge at the front of the primary molars or further back. The sense of taste is additionally long, stretching out past the back edge of the maxillary bone, and is punctured close to the third molars by very much created posterolateral palatal pits. There is no alisphenoid swagger, an expansion of the alisphenoid bone that in some different oryzomyines isolates two foramina in the skull. The sound-related bullae are huge. The state of the courses in the head is profoundly determined. In the mandible (lower jaw), the coronoid procedure, a procedure at the back, is all around created and the capsular procedure, a raising of the mandibular bone lodging the foundation of the lower incisor, is obvious. 

As normal in oryzomyines, the molars are pentalophodont (have the mesolophs and mesolophids, adornment peaks, very much created) and bunodont, with the cusps higher than the associating peaks. The cusps on the upper molars are masterminded in two longitudinal arrangement, not three as operating at a profit and darker rodents. The front cusps of the principal upper and lower molar (anterocone and anteroconid, separately) are expansive and not partitioned totally by an anteromedian flexus or flexid. Behind the anterocone, the anteroloph (a littler peak) is finished and isolated from the anterocone. On both the second and third lower molars, the anterolophid (a peak on the internal front corner) is available, a putative synapomorphy of the class. The principal molars have extra little roots notwithstanding the principle ones, with the goal that the upper first molar has four and the lower has three or four roots. 

As is normal for Sigmodontinae, the bog rice rodent and "O.Â couesi" have a perplexing penis, with the baculum (penis bone) showing huge bulges along the edges. The external surface of the penis is for the most part secured by little spines, yet there is a wide band of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (areola like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the penis is secured with little spines, a character these two animal groups share just with "Oligoryzomys" among oryzomyines analyzed. On the urethral procedure, situated in the hole toward the finish of the penis, a beefy procedure (the subapical lobule) is available; it is missing in all different oryzomyines with contemplated penes aside from "Holochilus brasiliensis". The two attributes are recuperated as synapomorphies of "O.Â couesi" in addition to the swamp rice rodent in Weksler's investigation. 

The scope of "Oryzomys" stretches out from New Jersey in the eastern United States through Mexico and Central America south to northwestern Colombia and east to northwestern Venezuela and CuraÃ§ao. Types of "Oryzomys" generally live in wet natural surroundings, for example, bogs, streams, and mangroves, however both the bog rice rodent and "O.Â couesi" are likewise incidentally experienced in drier living spaces. They happen or happened on numerous mainland rack islands and one maritime island, Jamaica; their ability at colonizing islands might be brought about by their nearby relationship with water and incessant event in beach front wetlands. The most seasoned fossils date to the Rancholabrean of the United States, around 300,000 years prior; in spite of the fact that there have been some before North American records, those are not in reality referable to "Oryzomys" or even Oryzomyini. Oryzomyines likely advanced in South America east of the Andes; the nearness of "Oryzomys" in Central America and different trans-Andean areas is believed to be the aftereffect of one of a few autonomous attacks of this district by oryzomyines. Then again, "Oryzomys" may have developed from the Pliocene North American "Jacobsomys". "O.Â antillarum" may have achieved Jamaica amid the last cold time frame while ocean levels were low. 

Conduct is known fundamentally from the bog rice rodent and "O.Â couesi", with some dissipated information from different species. "Oryzomys" are semiaquatic, investing much energy in the water, and generally for the most part live on the ground; both the bog rice rodent and "O.Â couesi" are known to be brilliant swimmers and will escape into the water when irritated. Both are additionally dynamic amid the night and construct homes of entwined vegetation, which might be suspended over the water. Reproducing may happen during the time in the two species, however is known to be occasionally factor in the bog rice rodent. In both, incubation takes around 21 to 28Â days and litter size is normally one to seven, averaging three to five. Youthful swamp rice rodents and "O.Â couesi" become reproductively dynamic when about 50Â days old. 

The bog rice rodent, "O.Â couesi", and "O.Â gorgasi" are known to be omnivores, eating both plant and creature material. They eat the two seeds and green plant parts and devour an assortment of creatures, including bugs, shellfish, and numerous others. The animal dwellingplace owl ("Tyto alba") is a noteworthy predator on the bog rice rodent and stays of "O.Â antillarum", "O.Â couesi", and "O.Â gorgasi" have been found in owl pellet stores. A few different creatures are known to go after "Oryzomys". An assortment of parasites are known from "O.Â couesi" and the bog rice rodent and two parasitic nematodes have been found in "O.Â gorgasi". 

Two types of "Oryzomys", "O.Â antillarum" and "O.Â nelsoni", have become wiped out since the nineteenth century, and a third, "O.Â peninsulae", is probably not going to be as yet surviving. Their eradication may have been brought about by natural surroundings decimation and by presented species, for example, the little Asian mongoose and the dark colored and dark rodent. These equivalent causes may undermine "O.Â gorgasi", which the IUCN Red List surveys as "Imperiled". "O.Â albiventer" has been influenced by human change of its living space, however likely still endures. Conversely, the far reaching species, the bog rice rodent and "O.Â couesi", are normal and of no protection concernâundoubtedly, both have been viewed as an irritationâhowever a few populaces are undermined. Like these two species, "O.Â dimidiatus" is evaluated as "Least Concern" by the Red List. 

The swamp rice rodent is the regular store of the Bayou infection, the second most normal reason for hantavirus pneumonic disorder in the United States. Two different hantaviruses, Catacamas infection and Playa de Oro infection, happen in "O.Â couesi" in Honduras and western Mexico, separately, however are not known to contaminate people.
