There Megan before long comes to grasp her sexual introduction, notwithstanding the treatment, and becomes hopelessly enamored. The supporting cast incorporates Melanie Lynskey, Dante Basco, Eddie Cibrian, Clea DuVall, Cathy Moriarty, Katrina Phillips, RuPaul, Richard Moll, Mink Stole, Kip Pardue, Michelle Williams, and Bud Cort. 

"Be that as it may, I'm a Cheerleader" was Babbit's first component film. It was propelled by an article about change treatment and her youth recognition with restoration programs. She utilized the account of a young lady discovering her sexual character to investigate the social development of sex jobs and heteronormativity. The outfit and set structure of the film featured these subjects utilizing counterfeit surfaces in extraordinary blues and pinks. 

When it was at first evaluated as NC-17 by the MPAA, Babbit made slices to enable it to be re-appraised as R. At the point when met in the narrative film "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" Babbit scrutinized the MPAA for oppressing films with gay substance. 

Numerous pundits disliked the film, contrasting it negatively and the movies of John Waters and censuring the bright creation structure. Despite the fact that the lead on-screen characters were lauded for their exhibitions, a portion of the characters were portrayed as clichÃ©. 

Seventeen-year-old Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is a radiant secondary school senior who adores cheerleading and is dating a football player, Jared (Brandt Wille). She hates kissing Jared, be that as it may, and inclines toward taking a gander at her kindred team promoters. Joined with Megan's enthusiasm for vegetarianism and Melissa Etheridge, her family and companions presume that she is in reality a lesbian. With the assistance of ex-gay Mike (RuPaul), they shock her with a mediation. Following this showdown, Megan is sent to True Directions, a reparative treatment camp which utilizes a five-advance program (like Alcoholics Anonymous' twelve-advance program) to change over its campers to heterosexuality. 

At True Directions, Megan meets the author, exacting taskmaster Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty), Mary's as far as anyone knows hetero child Rock (Eddie Cibrian), and a gathering of youngsters endeavoring to "fix" themselves of their homosexuality. With the inciting of Mary and different campers, Megan reluctantly concurs that she is a lesbian (stage 1 of the five-advance program). This reality, inconsistent with her customary, religious childhood, bothers her and she puts each exertion into getting to be hetero. From the get-go in her stay at True Directions, Megan finds two of the young men, Dolph and Clayton (Dante Basco and Kip Pardue), making out. She frenzies and shouts, prompting their disclosure by Mike. Dolph is made to leave and Clayton is rebuffed by being constrained into separation. 

The True Directions program includes the campers conceding their homosexuality (stage 1), rediscovering their sex personality by performing characteristically sexual orientation related errands (stage 2), finding the foundation of their homosexuality through family treatment (stage 3), demystifying the other sex (stage 4), and reproducing hetero intercourse (stage 5). Through the span of the program, Megan progresses toward becoming companions with another young lady at the camp, Graham (Clea DuVall) who, however more happy with being gay than Megan, was compelled to the camp at the danger of generally being repudiated by her family. 

The True Directions kids are urged to oppose Mary by two of her previous understudies, ex-ex-gays Larry and Lloyd (Richard Moll and Wesley Mann), who take the campers to a nearby gay bar where Graham and Megan's relationship forms into a sentiment. At the point when Mary finds the outing, she makes them all picket Larry and Lloyd's home, conveying bulletins and yelling homophobic maltreatment. Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have intercourse and start to begin to look all starry eyed at. At the point when Mary discovers, Megan, presently calm with her sexual character, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and, presently destitute, goes to remain with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, hesitant to resist her dad, stays at the camp. Megan and Dolph, who is additionally living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton. 

Megan and Dolph penetrate the True Directions graduation function where Dolph effectively urges Clayton away. Megan implores Graham to go along with them too, yet Graham anxiously decays. Megan then plays out a cheer for Graham and reveals to her that she adores her, at long last prevailing upon Graham. They drive off with Dolph and Clayton. The last scene of the film demonstrates Megan's folks (Mink Stole and Bud Cort) going to a PFLAG meeting to deal with their girl's homosexuality. 

"In any case, I'm a Cheerleader" was Babbit's first element film. She had recently coordinated two short movies, "Frog Crossing" (1996) and "Dozing Beauties" (1999), the two of which were appeared at the Sundance Film Festival. She proceeded to coordinate the 2005 spine chiller "The Quiet" and the 2007 parody "Itty Bitty Titty Committee". Babbit and Sperling (as maker) verified financing from Michael Burns, at that point the VP of Prudential Insurance (presently Vice Chairman of Lions Gate Entertainment) subsequent to demonstrating to him the content at Sundance. As indicated by Babbit, their one-sentence pitch was "Two secondary school young ladies begin to look all starry eyed at a reparative treatment camp." Burns gave them an underlying spending plan of US$500,000 which was expanded to US$1 million when the film went into creation. 

Babbit, whose mother runs an asylum called New Directions for youngsters with medication and liquor issues, had needed to make a parody about restoration and the 12-step program. In the wake of perusing an article about a man who had come back from a reparative treatment camp abhorring himself, she chose to join the two thoughts. With sweetheart Andrea Sperling, she concocted the thought for an element film about a team promoter who goes to a reparative treatment camp. They needed the principle character to be a team promoter since it is "...Â the apex of the American dream, and the American long for womanliness." Babbit needed the film to speak to the lesbian experience from the femme point of view to diverge from a few movies of the time that spoke to the butch viewpoint (for instance, "Go Fish" and "The Watermelon Woman"). She likewise needed to caricaturize both the religious right and the gay network. 

Not feeling fit the bill to compose the content herself, Babbit acquired screenwriter and late alumni of USC School of Cinematic Arts Brian Wayne Peterson. Peterson had involvement with reparative treatment while working at a jail facility for sex guilty parties. He has said that he needed to make a film that would engage individuals, yet in addition influence individuals to get irate and talk about the issues it raised. 

Babbit says that her persuasions for the look and feel of the film included John Waters, David LaChapelle, "Edward Scissorhands" and Barbie. 

She needed the generation and ensemble configuration to mirror the topics of the story. There is a movement from the natural universe of Megan's main residence, where the predominant hues are orange and darker, to the phony universe of True Directions, commanded by extreme blues and pinks (which are planned to demonstrate the simulation of sex development). As per Babbit, the germaphobic character of Mary Brown speaks to AIDS suspicion and her spotless, requested world is loaded up with plastic blossoms, counterfeit sky and PVC outfits. The outer shots of the vivid house total with a splendid pink picket fence were recorded in Palmdale, California. 

Babbit enrolled Clea DuVall, who had featured in her short film "Resting Beauties", to assume the job of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she had the capacity to get a ton of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first observed the content in the back of DuVall's vehicle and in this way reached her operator about it. She had seen and made the most of Babbit's short "Resting Beauties" and was anxious to work with the chief. She was not the main decision for the job of Megan. An anonymous performing artist needed to fill the role yet in the end turned it down on account of religious convictions; she didn't need her family to see her face on the blurb. Babbit quickly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan yet her official maker induced her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be directly for the All-American character. 

Babbit attempted to cast ethnic minorities for minor jobs, with an end goal to battle what she depicts as "bigotry at each dimension of making films." From the starting she expected the characters of Mike (played by RuPaul), Dolph (Dante Basco) and Andre (Douglas Spain) to be African American, Asian and Hispanic, separately. She at first considered Arsenio Hall for the character of Mike however says that Hall was awkward regarding assuming a gay-themed job. As Mike, RuPaul shows up out of drag. 

"Be that as it may, I'm a Cheerleader" isn't just about sexuality, yet additionally sex and the social development of sex jobs. One of the manners by which Babbit featured what she called the simulation of sex development was by utilizing serious blues and pinks in her generation and ensemble structure. Chris Holmlund in "Contemporary American Independent Film" takes note of this element of the movie and calls the ensembles "sexual orientation tuned." Ted Gideonse in "Out" magazine composed that the outfits and shades of the movie show how false the objectives of True Directions are. 

Sexual orientation jobs are additionally fortified by the assignments the campers need to perform in "Stage 2: Rediscovering Your Gender Identity." Nikki Sullivan in "A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory" says that this rediscovery is appeared to be troublesome and ineffective instead of the characteristic disclosure of their inactive heterosexuality. Sullivan says that the film not just features the manners by which sex and sexuality are built yet in addition takes the standards and facts about heteronormative society and renders them bizarre or "eccentric." Holmlund says that Babbit makes the straight characters less typical and less affable than the gay ones. Sullivan says that this test of heteronormativity makes "Yet I'm a Cheerleader" a representation of strange hypothesis. 

At the point when initially submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America rating board, "However I'm a Cheerleader" got a NC-17 rating. So as to get a financially suitable R rating, Babbit expelled a two-second shot of Graham's hand clearing Megan's dressed body, a camera dish up Megan's body when she is stroking off, and a remark that Megan "ate Graham out" (slang for cunnilingus). Babbit was met by Kirby Dick for his 2006 narrative film "This Film Is Not Yet Rated". A study of the MPAA's appraising framework, it recommends that films with gay substance are dealt with more stringently than those with just hetero content, and that scenes of female sexuality draw harsher analysis from the board than those of male sexuality. It thinks about this motion picture to "American Pie" (additionally discharged in 1999), which includes a high school kid jerking off and was given a R rating (however "American Pie" likewise initially got a NC-17 rating and furthermore expected slices to its masturbation scene to diminish its rating to R). Babbit says that she felt victimized for making a gay film. The film was evaluated as M (for develop groups of onlookers) in Australia and in New Zealand, 14A in Canada, 12 in Germany and 15 in the United Kingdom. 

The film debuted on September 12, 1999 at the Toronto International Film Festival and was appeared in January 2000 at the Sundance Film Festival.

Babbit says that in spite of the fact that Waters is one of her persuasions, she didn't need her film to have the "chomp" of his.

Cynthia Fuchs, for NitrateOnline.com, concurred, expressing that "nobody who is phobic may perceive himself in the film" and that "the crowd who may profit most from watching it either won't see the film or won't see the point."
