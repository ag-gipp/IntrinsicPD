The collection's title alludes to idealismâin particular, the capacity that an "internationalist" needs to escape from racial and social pressure. At the point when asked in a "Juice" talk with, Bernard Fanning outlined the title of the collection by expressing; 

"Internationalist" was recorded at Melbourne's Sing Studios, with Powderfinger joined by American maker Nick DiDia out of the blue. As the band had effectively arranged "around 30 or 40" tunes when they entered the studio, DiDia's undertaking was generally minor. Bassist John Collins said of DiDia; "Scratch was great. The manner in which Nick based the record was that he needed to record the band how we were at that specific minute, he would not like to play around something over the top." because of this frame of mind, the band just gone through one month in the studio, and the collection was blended by DiDia before long.

He said Powderfinger's reevaluation was as much for the band's own enthusiasm as it was for the "open's observation". In the interim, guitarist Ian Haug portrayed the collection as a "balance" between "Illustrations for Wooden Ears" ("the confounded monster") and "Twofold Allergic" ("completely streamlined"), Powderfinger's two past collections. He additionally concurred that the collection was considerably more trial, and depicted the collection as the band's "best", just as expressing that the collection that best duplicated "the sound we have live". 

Various tunes on "Internationalist" were politically and socially affected, despite the fact that the band denied it being a conscious theme.

The main single from the collection was "The Day You Come", a politically and socially impacted melody.

The second single was the twofold a-side, "Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray", discharged on 9 November 1998.

Collins depicted the way toward picking who the band would play with as a straightforward matter of picking whose music the band favored, expressing "we had played with a large portion of the groups, and in case you're going on visit with somebody you should run with somebody you coexist with and whose music you appreciate." Despite being enthusiasts of Swervedriver, who were prestigious for "their ability to recreate their collection sound flawlessly in the live setting" as per "Beat" Magazine's Neala Johnson, Fanning said Powderfinger could never endeavor to reproduce them, since he trusted their live shows to be significantly more "sincerely ground-breaking" than accounts.

"Internationalist"s basic gathering was sure, following in its graph achievement. "The Courier-Mail"s Nicola Six considered it the band's most various collection yet, utilizing "The Day You Come" for instance; its "opening staccato guitar riff to the manner in which the bass mixes with Bernard Fanning's nearly falsetto in the last melody" made it the "impeccable first single".
