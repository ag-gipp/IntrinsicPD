In an audit of the accompanying scene, "Diversion Day", he conceded that he thought Alina was behind Marcus' vehicle bomb, since he imagined that this story would have a capture by the end. Composing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall opined that Michael is "dealing with Hannah's longing to move since he cherishes her that much". Nonetheless, the Brittens later chose not to move in "Slack Water", the arrangement's tenth scene, attributable to individual concerns. 

Sepinwall noticed that he could see "the conspicuous parallels to Michael's own circumstance" in this portion, while "The A.V. Club" editorial manager Zack Handlen said that "Wakeful" "keeps on interfacing routine procedural storylines and find better approaches to give them more profound importance". Screen Rant author Kevin Yeoman said that this scene was tied in with "bringing two individuals who have floated separated back together" and that "Nightswimming" has "adjusted the arrangement's bigger riddle with distress and a twinge of good faith" on a "littler scale" contrasted with different sections of the program.

In his genuine rude awakening, an expectation on which the truth is genuine before the finish of the specific scene, Nick McHatton, a "television Fanatic" essayist, picked the "red reality", since it was "decent to perceive any reason why Hannah and Michael adore one another", while Handlen asserted that "the show has completed a fine occupation at to a great extent independent scenes", however every scene "feels like its own different story". He expected that "there's little feel of rising power or more serious peril", "given the clues of trick and the consistently increasing risk of Oregon". Caroline Preece of "Lair of Geek" at first expected "this arbitrary bareness will attach in to the show's focal folklore", however she later discovered Michael was simply swimming naked with Hannah. Preece imagined that Hannah and Michael "reconnected" in the scene, as did McHatton.

This scene got commonly blended surveys from faultfinders. Sepinwall was frustrated with the general storyline of the "green reality"; he guaranteed that if the scene was just founded on the "red reality", the section would have been "impeccably fine". In the interim, Handlen imagined that if the circular segments of the "red the truth" were excluded in this portion, it would not fill in as a scene. While Sepinwall called the "green reality" storyline "exhausting", Handlen felt that the storylines of Marcus and Alina did not "make any difference"; as per Handlen, the scene ought not have dove into the subtleties of the visitor stars. Sepinwall and Handlen were disillusioned that Rex did not show up in the scene; Handlen commended Rex, considering him an "affable young kid" who merits all the more running time. 

Handlen felt that Michael sounded "sensible", and Sepinwall said ""Awake"...[has already done] a great job of making the visitor characters associated with [Michael]'s cases sufficiently intriguing that I care about what occurs in every examination." He suspected that until this scene the journalists had been savvy on visitor stars and on not concentrating on them to an extreme; he additionally composed that on-screen characters Lawrence and Valderrama did not appear to coordinate one another.

Sepinwall enjoyed Jake's performing artist, Lawrence, adulating his appearance on the "Wakeful" scene. 

Fowler demonstrated dissatisfaction as the section gave no "turns" or "issues" with respect to Michael, or his treatment sessions. He looked at "Nightswimming" to other "Wakeful" scenes, asserting that different passages offer more "plot" and "enthusiastic" issues, while Preece called the section "weird". She believed that the storylines of the "red the truth" were progressively "intriguing" than the "green reality" storylines, and Fowler was baffled with the melody decision for the portion, asserting that the R.E.M. melody "Nightswimming" ought to have been played. Preece portrayed the "Nightswimming" scene as a "dull procedural scene" that is without any folklore or forward movement; she called the portion "level". In spite of saying that she was "losing persistence" with "Wakeful", Preece said that she was still "sharp" to see more. 

While Preece composed that the scene was missing key components from past scenes, Fowler condemned the portion, since the initial fifteen minutes of the section were about Marcus and Elena and their lives. Notwithstanding this, Fowler applauded the last scene of the scene, and Preece called Michael and Hannah's relationship "dazzling". Fowler gave this a "7.5" "decent" evaluating, the least score for a "Wakeful" scene around then. Preece suspected that the scene made "little missteps", which "Alert" couldn't bear to make. McHatton said that "Nightswimming" contains "No tricks, no executioners, not in any case kills", only a "procedural case that reflected [Michael]'s life at home". In spite of this, he applauded Michael and Hannah's relationship, guaranteeing that "it's decent to look as they reconnect with one another"; he gave it a "4.5" rating out of "5.0". In the mean time, Yeoman expressed that the section opened to "a specific measure of eccentricity" and that, "beginning [the episode] off with the arrangement's hero in the buff isn't actually reading material."
