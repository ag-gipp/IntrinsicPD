New York State Route 319 

New York State RouteÂ 319 (NYÂ 319) was a state expressway in Chenango County, New York, in the United States. It was long and associated the village of Preston to the adjacent city of Norwich. The course started in the village at a convergence with three province kept up roadways and continued eastbound through the town of Preston to downtown Norwich, where it ended at a crossing point with NYÂ 12. 

What progressed toward becoming NYÂ 319 was initially worked amid the mid nineteenth century as the Norwich and Preston Turnpike, one of numerous secretly kept up expressways in the territory of New York. The territory of New York accepted responsibility for road's steering in the mid twentieth century, and the Prestonâ Norwich state thruway was assigned as NYÂ 319 as a feature of the 1930 renumbering of state roadways in New York. Support of NYÂ 319 was part between the state and the city of Norwich, with the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) taking care of the piece of the course west of as far as possible. 

In 1962, the New York State Legislature endorsed an expressway support swap that would exchange the state-kept up segment of NYÂ 319 to Chenango County when another arrangement was developed for NYÂ 23 through the northwestern piece of the district. The undertaking was finished in July 1984, at which time the NYÂ 319 assignment was totally expelled and Chenango County accepted upkeep of the course's previous arrangement west of Norwich. The new area street was redesignated County RouteÂ 10A (CRÂ 10A). 

NYÂ 319 started at a convergence with three province courses (CRÂ 4, CRÂ 10, and CRÂ 19) in the village of Preston, a little network in the northern segment of the town of a similar name. The parkway continued eastbound, climbing the side of a slope around above ocean level at its pinnacle. NYÂ 319 quickly slipped to cross a spring then kept climbing, achieving a rise of close Packerâ Mason Cemetery. The course gradually dropped in height from the burial ground, crossing Gilmore Brook on its way into the town of Norwich, where it met CRÂ 19 for a second time only east of the town line. Past CRÂ 19, the interstate swung southeastward to plummet the side of an edge sitting above the city of Norwich. 

At the base of the drop, the course turned eastbound and traversed Canasawacta Creek, a tributary of the Chenango River, as it entered the city of Norwich and ended up known as West Main Street. In Norwich, NYÂ 319 served Emmanuel Episcopal Church and went through the Chenango County Courthouse District, set up in 1975 in the city's downtown territory. In the focal point of the historically significant area, NYÂ 319 achieved its eastern end at its crossing point with NYÂ 12 (Broad Street). West Main Street turns out to be East Main Street at this intersection, and the last proceeds with eastbound as NYÂ 990L, one of New York's reference courses. 

The town of Norwich was made on JanuaryÂ 19, 1793, involving an a lot bigger region than it does today. On AprilÂ 2, 1806, some portion of the town was divided from to shape another town named Preston. A contract on AprilÂ 8, 1808, set up the Norwich and Preston Turnpike, an interstate interfacing the town of Preston in the west to the town of Norwich in the east. The Norwich and Preston Turnpike was exclusive and kept up, as most roads in New York were at the time. 

The directing of the Norwich and Preston Turnpike was taken over by the province of New York in the mid twentieth century. On DecemberÂ 14, 1907, an agreement was let to improve a long bit of the previous expressway. Development cost $57,714 (comparable to $ in 2019) and was finished by late 1908. The improved parkway was added to the state expressway framework on NovemberÂ 16, 1908, as State HighwayÂ 598 (SHÂ 598). A second contract to improve an extra of the interstate was let on AprilÂ 9, 1910. Work on this fragment cost around $6,000 (identical to $ in 2019) and was finished by mid-1911. This area of the expressway was added to the state interstate framework on JulyÂ 22, 1911 as SHÂ 598A. The principal set of posted courses in New York were doled out in 1924; in any case, none of the previous Norwich and Preston Turnpike was doled out an assignment around then. 

In the 1930 renumbering of state expressways in New York, a few of the courses doled out amid the 1920s were renumbered or changed. In the meantime, many state-kept up interstates which did not yet have a course number, for example, the Prestonâ Norwich state parkway, were relegated one. The street was assigned as NYÂ 319 and kept up by the New York State Department of Transportation west of the Norwich city limits and by the city of Norwich inside the city. The arrangement of NYÂ 319 stayed unaltered for the following 50 years. 

Proprietorship and upkeep of NYÂ 319 west of the Norwich city limits was slated to be exchanged from the territory of New York to Chenango County as a major aspect of a parkway support swap affirmed by the New York State Legislature and marked into law on FebruaryÂ 13, 1962. Be that as it may, the swap in upkeep was dependent upon the development and fruition of another arrangement for NYÂ 23 in northwestern Chenango County. The new street would reach out from the Chenangoâ Cortland province fringe in the town of Pitcher to Scotts Corners in the town of Pharsalia, a point west of the village of North Pharsalia. At the time, NYÂ 23 started at NYÂ 26 in northwest Pharsalia and pursued an easterly and southerly directing to Scotts Corners, where it turned eastbound onto its cutting edge arrangement. The segment of the trade depicting the streets that would be exchanged to Chenango County is written in New York State Highway Law as pursues, with comments in enclosures: 

The new parkway in the towns of Pitcher and Pharsalia was finished in July 1984, at which time NYÂ 23 was rerouted to pursue the interstate and the total of the pre-affirmed thruway upkeep swap became effective. Along these lines, proprietorship and support of NYÂ 23's old arrangement through Pharsalia and the sum of NYÂ 319 west of Norwich was exchanged to Chenango County. The previous arrangement of NYÂ 23 moved toward becoming CRÂ 42 while the now area kept up segment of NYÂ 319 was redesignated CRÂ 10A, a goad of the prior CRÂ 10. The NYÂ 319 assignment was likewise expelled from West Main Street in the city of Norwich as of now. 

In 1997, the scaffold that had conveyed NYÂ 319 over Gilmore Brook in the town of Preston was supplanted. The new structure handles a normal of 1,154 vehicles for each day. More distant east, the scaffold over Canasawacta Creek was likewise remade in 1997. It was worked in 1937 and conveys a normal of 2,093 autos every day.
