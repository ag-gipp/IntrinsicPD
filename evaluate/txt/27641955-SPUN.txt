Persoonia linearis 

Persoonia linearis, usually known as the restricted leaved geebung, is a bush local to New South Wales and Victoria in eastern Australia. It comes to , or every so often , in stature and has thick, dim dark papery bark. The leaves are, as the species name recommends, pretty much straight fit as a fiddle, and are up to long, and wide. The little yellow blossoms show up in summer, harvest time and late-fall (December to July), trailed by little green plump organic product known as drupes. Inside the class "Persoonia", it is an individual from the "Lanceolata" gathering of 58 firmly related species. "P.Â linearis" interbreeds with a few different animal categories where they become together. 

Found in dry sclerophyll timberland on sandstone-based supplement lacking soils, "P.Â linearis" is adjusted to a flame inclined condition; the plants resprout epicormic buds from underneath their thick bark after bushfires. The organic product are devoured by vertebrates, for example, kangaroo, possums and currawongs. Similarly as with different individuals from the sort, "P.Â linearis" is uncommon in development as it is difficult to proliferate, either by seed or cuttings. It adjusts promptly to development, favoring acidic soils with great waste and no less than a halfway bright viewpoint. 

English botanist and craftsman Henry Charles Andrews depicted "Persoonia linearis" in 1799, in the second volume of his "Botanists Repository, Comprising Colour'd Engravings of New and Rare Plants". He had been given a plant in blossom by J. Robertson of Stockwell, who had developed it from seed in 1794. The species name is the Latin "linearis" "straight", alluding to the state of the leaves. 

In the interim, German botanist Karl Friedrich von Gaertner had begat the name "Pentadactylon angustifolium" in 1807 from an example in the accumulation of Joseph Banks to portray what ended up being similar species. The variety name got from the Greek "penta-" "five" and "dactyl" "fingers", and alludes to the five-lobed cotyledons. The horticulturist Joseph Knight portrayed this species as the tight leaved ("Persoonia angustifolia") in his dubious 1809 work "On the development of the plants having a place with the normal request of Proteeae", however the binomial name is ill-conceived as it postdated Andrews' depiction and name. Carl Meissner portrayed a populace from the Tambo River in Victoria as a different assortment, "Persoonia linearis" var. "latior" in 1856, yet no assortments or subspecies are perceived. German botanist Otto Kuntze proposed the binomial name "Linkia linearis" in 1891, from Cavanilles' unique portrayal of the class "Linkia" however the name was inevitably dismissed for "Persoonia". In 1919, French botanist Michel Gandoger depicted three species all since reallocated to "P.Â linearis"; "P. phyllostachys" from material gathered at Mount Wilson sent to him by the herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and "P.Â walteri" and "P.Â breviuscula" from Melbourne-based plant gatherer Charles Walter, whose records have been addressed. The short-leaved material of "P.Â breviuscula" was noted to have been gathered in Queensland yet this is currently thought to have been mistakenly recorded. Gandoger depicted 212 taxa of Australian plants, practically all of which ended up being species effectively portrayed. 

In 1870, George Bentham distributed the first infrageneric plan of "Persoonia" in Volume 5 of his milestone "Vegetation Australiensis". He isolated the class into three segments, setting "P.Â linearis" in "P."Â sect. "Amblyanthera", and perceiving "Pentadactylon angustifolium" as similar species, in the wake of looking at the example in the Banksian Herbarium. He portrayed an assortment "sericea" from the Shoalhaven River district and furthermore noticed the inconsistency in Robert Brown's depiction of the species. Dark colored had noticed the bark to be smooth, rather than Ferdinand von Mueller and other people who recorded the bark as layered. 

The sort was inspected by Peter Weston for the "Greenery of Australia" treatment in 1995, and "P.Â linearis" was put in the "Lanceolata" gathering, a gathering of 54 firmly related species with comparative blossoms yet altogether different foliage. These species will frequently interbreed with one another where two individuals from the gathering happen, and half and halves with "P.Â chamaepeuce", "P.Â conjuncta", "P.Â curvifolia", "P.Â lanceolata", "P.Â media", five subspecies of "P.Â mollis", "P.Â myrtilloides" subsp. "cunninghamii", "P.Â oleoides", "P.Â pinifolia" and "P.Â sericea" have been recorded. Robert Brown at first depicted the crossover with "P.Â levis" as a species ""Persoonia lucida"", which is presently known as "Persoonia Ã lucida", and has been recorded from the southeast backwoods of the New South Wales south coast. 

Bentham wrote in 1870 that the name "geebung", got from the Dharug language word "geebung" or "jibbong", which had been utilized by the indigenous individuals for the products of this species. It passes by the normal names of tight leaved geebung or restricted leaf geebung. "Naam-burra" is a native name from the Illawarra district. 

"Persoonia linearis" develops as a tall bush to little tree, once in a while coming to in stature yet more ordinarily around tall. The flaky delicate bark is dim superficially, while more profound layers are rosy. Inside the bark are epicormic buds, which grow new development after bushfire. The new development is bushy. The leaves are pretty much straight fit as a fiddle, estimating long and wide, with somewhat down-moved edges. 

The yellow blossoms show up in summer, pre-winter and late-fall (December to July), cresting over January and February. They are masterminded in verdant racemes, and each stem may endure to 50 blooms. "P.Â linearis" is depicted as auxotelic, which implies each stalk bears an individual blossom that is subtended by a leaf at its intersection with the stem. Known as pedicels, these are shrouded in fine hair and measure 2â 8Â mm long. Every individual blossom comprises of a round and hollow perianth, comprising of tepals intertwined for a large portion of their length, inside which are both male and female parts. The tepals are long and canvassed in fine hair outwardly. The focal style is encompassed by the anther, which parts into four portions; these twist back and look like a cross when seen from above. They give an arrival region to bugs visiting the disgrace, which is situated at the tip of the style. The blooms are trailed by the advancement of smooth plump drupes, which are green and pretty much round, estimating in distance across. Develop drupes may have purple blotches. Every bear a couple of seeds inside a woody "stone" and is shed once ready, for the most part from September to November. 

A standout amongst the most well-known geebungs, "Persoonia linearis" is found from the Macleay River catchment on the New South Wales Mid North Coast to the Tambo River in eastern Victoria. It is found from ocean level to heights of with a normal yearly precipitation of . It is a part of dry sclerophyll backwoods on both sandstone and mud soils. It develops in radiant to gently shaded zones in open timberland or forest with a shrubby understory. In the Sydney Basin, it is related with so much trees as Sydney peppermint ("Eucalyptus piperita"), silvertop fiery remains ("E.Â sieberi"), blue-leaved stringybark ("E.Â agglomerata"), blackbutt ("E.Â pilularis"), dim ironbark ("E.Â paniculata"), smart gum ("E.Â rossii"), Sydney blue gum ("E.Â saligna"), limited leaved stringybark ("E.Â sparsifolia") and smooth-woofed apple ("Angophora costata") and bushes, for example, "Grevillea obtusiflora", "G.Â phylicoides", Kowmung ("Hakea dohertyi"), long leaf smoke shrub ("Conospermum longifolium") and solid geebung ("Persoonia rigida"). In the region of Nowra and Jervis Bay, it is an understory segment of the across the board Currambene Lowlands Forest people group, nearby such plants as gorse severe pea ("Daviesia ulicifolia"), whiskery heath ("Leucopogon juniperinus") and local daphne ("Pittosporum undulatum") with spotted gum ("Corymbia maculata"), white stringybark ("Eucalyptus globoidea") and woollybutt ("E.Â longifolia") as the overwhelming trees. The tall dry sclerophyll woodland is on sloping landscape with great waste. The basic soil is a yellow topsoil beginning from mudstone, siltstone and sandstone. 

"Persoonia linearis" is one of a few types of "Persoonia" that recover by resprouting from trunks or stems more prominent than thick after bushfire, an adjustment to the flame inclined natural surroundings where it develops. Notwithstanding, just bigger trunks of measurement may make due to reshoot after hot flames. The thick papery bark shields and protects the hidden epicormic buds from the blazes. The plant can reshoot from the base, yet for the most part just if the stem or trunk is executed. 

Colletid honey bees of the variety "Leioproctus", subgenus "Cladocerapis" only scrounge on and fertilize blossoms of numerous types of "Persoonia". Honey bees of subgenus "Filiglossa" in similar variety, which additionally have some expertise in benefiting from "Persoonia" blooms, don't have all the earmarks of being compelling pollinators. Weighing 1900Â mg (0.07Â oz), the natural product are adjusted to be eaten by vertebrates, for example, kangaroos, possums and currawongs and other extensive fowls. Seeds have been recorded in the dung of the brush-followed shake wallaby ("Petrogale penicillata"). 

"Persoonia linearis" is valuable as a supporting plant and reacts well to pruning. Its foliage has been utilized in decorative designs, and its vivid bark is a green element. It is a genuinely simple plant to develop in patio nurseries, yet is infrequently observed because of challenges in proliferation. Germination from seed is low, and can take numerous months. When built up it can endure expanded dry periods and is strong to ices. Ideal developing conditions are part shade and a very much depleted corrosive soil, however "P.Â linearis" develops promptly in full sun. Persoonias when all is said in done are touchy to over the top phosphorus, and develop without manure or with low-phosphorus moderate discharge definitions. They can likewise end up lacking in iron and manganese. First developed in England in 1794 from seed, it was additionally allegedly engendered from cuttings; Andrews depicted it as an "attractive nursery plant, proceeding to blossom through the harvest time months and delivering great seeds." Joseph Knight announced that cuttings would be fruitful as long as material might have been "reasonably picked", and that plants had set seed every so often. 

A compound with antimicrobial action was separated from the aging drupes of a crossover of "Persoonia linearis" and "P.Â pinifolia" developing in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in 1994, and recognized as 4-hydroxyphenyl 6-"O"- [(3"R")- 3,4-dihydroxy-2-methylenebutanoyl]-Î²- - glucopyranoside.
