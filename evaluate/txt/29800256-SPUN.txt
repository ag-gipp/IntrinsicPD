Following training at Melbourne High School, he entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1928. He was one of four cadets supported that year by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), which did not at that arrange have its very own officer preparing school. Budgetary limitations forced by the Great Depression required the exchange of these cadets out of Duntroon halfway through their four-year course. In spite of the fact that offered positions in the Australian Public Service or assignments for momentary commissions with the Royal Air Force, all were resolved to present with the RAAF, evidently "pleased" at the possibility of entering their picked administration early. 

Enrolling in the Air Force on 10Â December 1930, McLachlan finished his flight preparing the next year. He was appointed as a pilot in 1932, and attempted different flight-guidance and general obligations jobs throughout the following five years. In 1937, he was an individual from the RAAF unexpected presented on Britain to praise the crowning ordinance of King GeorgeÂ VI. Positioned flight lieutenant, he was given order of No.Â 3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron, working Hawker Demon contenders out of RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, on 4Â December 1939. He was elevated to squadron pioneer on 1Â February 1940, and drove his unit to the Middle East on 15Â July. 

Cruising by means of Bombay, India, No.Â 3 Squadron landed at Suez, Egypt, in late August 1940. In its unique armed force participation job supporting the Australian sixth Division in the North African Campaign, the squadron was furnished with out of date Gloster Gladiator biplane contenders and Westland Lysander perception air ship. As a component of his unit's work-up for activities, McLachlan sorted out preparing practices with the 6thÂ Division, just as composed tests to test his men's learning of armed force language and air-to-ground correspondences. 

Portrayed by student of history Alan Stephens as "sour yet able", McLachlan drove No.Â 3 Squadron through the Battle of Sidi Barrani in December 1940, trailed by the Battle of Bardia and the catch of Tobruk in January 1941. Preceding changing over to Hawker Hurricanes that month, the unit was credited with decimating twelve Italian airplane for the loss of five Gladiators and two pilots; McLachlan shot down a Fiat CR.42 on 10Â December 1940, a similar activity in which individual squadron part and future pro Gordon Steege asserted his first "kill". Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief RAF Middle East, Air Marshal Sir Arthur Longmore, adulated McLachlan and his squadron for their "high confidence and flexibility to leave conditions". 

McLachlan was granted the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for his "fine characteristics as a military pilot" and "decided administration" even with frequently "overpowering quantities of adversary flying machine"; the reference was proclaimed in the "London Gazette" on 11Â February 1941 under the name "Ian Duncan MacLachlan". He was the first RAAF military pilot to be improved in World WarÂ II. Elevated to wing officer, he assumed responsibility for the recently settled RAF Benina, Benghazi, on 13Â February, giving over No.Â 3 Squadron to Squadron Leader Peter Jeffrey. By May 1941, McLachlan was going about as RAAF Liaison Officer for the new Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, RAF Middle East, Air Marshal Arthur Tedder. The Air Board in Melbourne, led by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, was not counseled over this difference in job and protested the RAF's "one-sided activity" in delegating McLachlan, however in the long run submitted and allowed him to stay at the post to facilitate offices for RAAF work force in the locale until July, when he was reviewed to Australia. 

In 1942 McLachlan took direction of RAAF Station Canberra, and, later in the year, RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria. Posted for activity in New Guinea, he turned into the debut officer of No.Â 71 Wing at Milne Bay in February 1943. The wing comprised of No.Â 6 Squadron (flying Lockheed Hudsons), No.Â 75 Squadron (P-40 Kittyhawks), No.Â 77 Squadron (Kittyhawks), and No.Â 100 Squadron (Bristol Beauforts). It went under the control of No.Â 9 Operational Group, the RAAF's "head battling unit" in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), whose design was to go about as a versatile strike constrain in help of progressing Allied troops. In March the Beauforts partook in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, "the conclusive flying commitment" in the SWPA as indicated by General Douglas MacArthur, however they were unfit to score any hits against Japanese boats. 

By June 1943, McLachlan had been advanced gathering commander and given order of No.Â 73 Wing. He set up his central command at Goodenough Island, where he was in charge of sorting out the wing into a contender arrangement comprising of No.Â 76 Squadron (Kittyhawks), No.Â 77 Squadron (Kittyhawks) and No.Â 79 Squadron (Spitfires). Just as giving nearby air barrier, and contender escort for Australian aircraft, the Kittyhawks were outfitted with ignitable and universally useful bombs so they could take part in ground assault missions, a training that had just been utilized by Commonwealth powers in the Middle Eastern theater. In August, the wing exchanged to Kiriwina, while No.Â 9 Group's other battle arrangement, No.Â 71 Wing, took over duty regarding Goodenough. Delegated senior air staff officer (SASO) at No.Â 9 Group, McLachlan gave over direction of No.Â 73 Wing to Wing Commander Gordon Steege in October 1943. Towards the finish of his presenting on No.Â 9 Group, McLachlan told its previous authority, Air Commodore Joe Hewitt, that the USAAF was "jumping ahead" of the RAAF, which was by and large left to "tidy up the leftovers" of Japanese opposition. He expected that Australian military pilots particularly would be "progressively anxious if the Americans took all the battling plums". Scarcely a year later, spirit among senior RAAF military pilots had dropped to such a degree, that eight of them endeavored to leave their bonuses in the purported "Morotai Mutiny". 

In March 1944, McLachlan assumed responsibility for Southern Area Command, Melbourne, with duty regarding oceanic watch, guard escort and hostile to submarine fighting in southern Australian waters; he gave over to Group Captain Charles Eaton the next January. Referenced in despatches on 9Â March 1945 for his "courageous and recognized administration", McLachlan came back to activity in the South-West Pacific as officer of No.Â 81 Wing, which contained Nos. 76, 77 and 82 Squadrons, working Kittyhawks. As a feature of the Australian First Tactical Air Force in the Dutch East Indies, the wing was slated to participate in Operation Oboe One, the Battle of Tarakan, in May however was unfit to migrate from Noemfoor to its new base on Morotai in time. It battled in Operation Oboe Six, the intrusion of Labuan, from June and depended on the island when the Pacific War finished in August 1945. 

Following the finish of threats, McLachlan volunteered to present with the Allied occupation powers in Japan. He wedded Margaret Helen Chrystal on 5Â January 1946; they had a child and a girl. Elevated to acting air commodore on 1Â March, he was named SASO of the British Commonwealth Air Group (BCAIR), headquartered in Kure and in charge of No.Â 81 Wing RAAF, just as squadrons from the Royal Air Force, Royal New Zealand Air Force, and Indian Air Force. Coming back to Australia in 1948, he filled in as Air Commodore Operations at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, at which time the English Electric Canberra was requested as Australia's first fly aircraft, halfway for its capacity to convey atomic weapons. He finished his term in September 1951 and took over North-Eastern Area Command, based at Townsville, Queensland. Following his arrangement as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 New Year's Honors, McLachlan was presented on Britain for a long time, first going to the Imperial Defense College, London, and after that filling in as RAF Director of Flying Training at the Air Ministry amid 1955â 56. Raised to air bad habit marshal, he came back to Australia in 1957 to progress toward becoming Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Training Command in Melbourne. 

As AOC Training Command, McLachlan attempted two surveys that would have, as indicated by the official history of the post-war RAAF, "a huge impact broadcasting live Force of the 1960s". In 1957, at the prompting of the Air Member for Personnel, Air Vice Marshal Frederick Scherger, McLachlan shaped a board to audit the viability of the schedule at RAAF College for meeting the future needs of the Air Force during a time of guided rockets and atomic weaponry. This prompted an approach of cadets undertaking scholarly degrees, in accordance with comparable organizations in the other equipped administrations; the school was accordingly renamed RAAF Academy. The official history of the RAAF believed the outcome to be just incompletely effective; while it turned out very taught officers, they were instructed exclusively in an inflexible logical order fit to an Air Force that never appeared, one depending on rockets as opposed to kept an eye on flying machine. In 1959, McLachlan led a council to audit the adjustment in the RAAF's direction structure that had occurred in 1953â 54, from a geologically based "territory" framework to a practical framework comprising of Home, Maintenance Command, and Training Commands. Presuming this had diminished duplication and improved productivity, he proposed further defense by amalgamating Training and Maintenance Commands to shape another association, Support Command. His arrangement was properly executed, similar to his proposal that Home Command, in charge of air tasks, be renamed Operational Command. 

McLachlan was designated Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1959, preceding being presented on Washington, DC, as attachÃ© heading up the Australian Joint Services Staff in 1961. Amid his term in the US, Australia requested the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing plane as a trade for the Canberra. In spite of what was touted as a firm timetable and cost plan for the request, McLachlan trusted to an associate that he had genuine worries about when and if the RAAF would really get the F-111, and what the last expense would be. As per Air Force antiquarian Alan Stephens, "notwithstanding for such a clever and scornful man as McLachlan, that was to demonstrate an agonizingly farsighted perception", as the new aircraft was conveyed six years late and hugely over spending plan. Following his arrival from Washington, McLachlan moved toward becoming Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) in February 1964. As AMSE he sat reporting in real time Board, the administration's controlling body that comprised of its most senior officers, led by the Chief of the Air Staff. In this position he attempted to expand the extent of tertiary instructed supply officers, following comparative accomplishments among building officers in the RAAF's Technical Branch. He was delegated a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1966 New Year's Honors, the reference taking note of especially his chairmanship of the two "noteworthy" boards of trustees that redesigned RAAF College and the Air Force's direction structure in the late 1950s. The utilization of electronic information handling turned out to be increasingly across the board amid McLachlan's residency as AMSE, and by 1968 the RAAF's supply framework had been mechanized. 

McLachlan finished his term as Air Member for Supply and Equipment on 23Â July 1968 and resigned from the RAAF; he was separated from his significant other that year. After leaving the military, he turned into an aeronautical expert toward the Northrop Corporation, and director of Information Electronics Pty Ltd from 1983, serving in the two positions until 1987. He was additionally director of Pokolbin Winemakers from 1970 through 1975. In retirement he kept on practicing his enthusiasm for Australia's resistance, participating in 1975 a gathering of intellectuals, including previous Chief of the Air Staff Sir Alister Murdoch, who advanced the expansion of atomic weapons to the nation's arms stockpile. An inhabitant of Sydney's Darling Point, Ian McLachlan passed on 14Â July 1991.
