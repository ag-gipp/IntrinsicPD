After the war, the Treaty of Versailles incredibly decreased the span of the German Navy. The vessel was sold for rejecting to a German organization and separated in 1920. 

After the German "Kaiserliche Marine" (Imperial Navy) requested the four s in 1889, a blend of budgetary limitations, resistance in the "Reichstag" (Imperial Diet), and an absence of an intelligible armada plan deferred the procurement of further war vessels. The previous Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt" (Imperial Navy Office), Leo von Caprivi turned into the Chancellor of Germany in 1890, and "Vizeadmiral" (Vice Admiral) Friedrich von Hollmann turned into the new Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt". Hollmann mentioned the first in 1892, yet the Franco-Russian Alliance, marked the prior year, put the administration's consideration on growing the Army's financial plan.

In late 1893, Hollmann introduced the Navy's evaluations for the 1894â 1895 spending year, and now the "Reichstag" endorsed the new ship; a second individual from the class followed in mid 1896, and the third ship, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was approved for the next year's financial plan. 

"Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was long generally speaking and had a light emission a draft of forward and toward the back. She dislodged typically and up to at full burden. The ship was fueled by three 3-barrel vertical triple-extension steam motors that drove three screw propellers. Steam was given by four Marine-type and eight tube shaped boilers, all of which consumed coal. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse"s powerplant was evaluated at , which created a top speed of .

He started a program of maritime development in the late 1880s; the principal war vessels worked under this program were the four "Brandenburg"- class ships. These were promptly trailed by the five "Kaiser Friedrich III"- class war vessels, of which "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was the third. Her bottom was laid on 22 January 1898 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel, as development number 22. She was requested under the agreement name "Artificial KÃ¶nig Wilhelm", to supplant the out of date defensively covered frigate . Her booked propelling on 29 April 1899 was postponed to 1 June after an extensive flame at the shipyard harmed the slipway. Louise, the Grand Duchess of Baden, initiated the ship after her dad Wilhelm I of Germany, the ship's namesake. Wilhelm II gave the starting discourse for the ship celebrating his granddad. Subsequent to finishing fitting-out work, dockyard ocean preliminaries started on 19 February 1901, trailed by acknowledgment preliminaries that began on 18 March. These were finished by May, and she was formally charged on 5 May. That year, Erich Raederâwho proceeded to direction the "Kriegsmarine" in World War IIâwas elevated to fill in as a watch officer on board her. 

In the wake of charging in 1901, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" joined her sister sends in the I Squadron of the "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet). After her sister steered into the rocks and must be docked for fixes, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" supplanted her as the I Squadron leader, which was directed by Prince Heinrich, the sibling of Wilhelm II. She held this post until 24 October, when "Kaiser Friedrich III" came back to support. Meanwhile, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was available for the Kiel Week cruising regatta in June and the commitment of a landmark at the "Marineakademie" (Naval Academy) in Kiel. Toward the finish of July, she drove the squadron on a journey to Spanish waters, and keeping in mind that docked in CÃ¡diz, they rendezvoused with the "Brandenburg"- class war vessels coming back from East Asian waters. The I Squadron was back in Kiel by 11 August, however the late landing of the "Brandenburg"s deferred the investment of the I Squadron in the yearly pre-winter armada preparing. The moves started with activities in the German Bight, trailed by a fake assault on the fortresses in the lower Elbe. Gunnery drills occurred in Kiel Bay before the armada steamed to Danzig Bay, where the moves finished up on 15 September. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" and the remainder of I Squadron went on their ordinary winter voyage to Norway in December, which incorporated a prevent at Oslo from 7 to 12 December. 

In 1902, the new ship steered into the rocks off KorsÃ¸r; "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" returned her under tow to port. The I Squadron went on a short voyage in the western Baltic at that point set out on a noteworthy journey around the British Isles, which kept going from 25 April to 28 May. Individual and squadron moves occurred from June to August, hindered just by a voyage to Norway in July. The yearly armada moves started in August in the Baltic and deduced in the North Sea with an armada audit in the Jade. Amid the activities, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was appointed to the "threatening" drive, just like a few of her sister ships. The "unfriendly" drive was first entrusted with keeping the "German" squadron from going through the Great Belt in the Baltic. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" and a few different war vessels were then entrusted with driving a passage into the mouth of the Elbe River, where the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and Hamburg could be seized. The "threatening" flotilla achieved these errands inside three days. The ordinary winter journey pursued amid 1â 12 December. 

In 1903, the armada, which was made out of just a single squadron of war vessels, was rearranged as the "Dynamic Battle Fleet". "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" stayed in the I Squadron alongside her sister ships and the freshest s, while the more seasoned "Brandenburg"- class ships were set available for later to be modified. The principal quarter of 1903 pursued the typical example of preparing works out. The squadron went on a preparation journey in the Baltic, trailed by a voyage to Spain from 7 May to 10 June.

The German armada withdrew on 13 July, destined for the Netherlands; the I Squadron tied down in Vlissingen the next day. There, the boats were visited by Queen Wilhelmina. The I Squadron stayed in Vlissingen until 20 July, when it left for a voyage in the northern North Sea with the remainder of the armada. The squadron ceased in Molde, Norway, on 29 July, while different units went to different ports. The armada reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, where it led a fake assault on the harbor on 12 August. The armada at that point started arrangements for the pre-winter moves, which started on 29 August in the Baltic. The armada moved toward the North Sea on 3 September, where it partook in a noteworthy landing activity, after which the boats took the ground troops from the IX Corps that took part in the activities to Altona for a motorcade for Wilhelm II. The boats at that point directed their own motorcade for the Kaiser off the island of Helgoland on 6 September. After three days, the armada came back to the Baltic by means of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, where it took an interest in further landing tasks with the IX Corps and the Guards Corps. On 15 September, the moves arrived at an end. The I Squadron went on its winter preparing voyage, this opportunity toward the eastern Baltic, from 22 November to 2 December.

The armada at that point traveled through the Kattegat and halted in Copenhagen and Stockholm. The late spring voyage finished on 9 August; the harvest time moves that would regularly have started presently were postponed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month. The British armada ceased in Danzig, SwinemÃ¼nde, and Flensburg, where it was welcomed by units of the German Navy; "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and the primary German armada were moored at SwinemÃ¼nde for the event. The visit's effect was diminished by the continuous Anglo-German maritime weapons contest. Because of the British visit, the 1905 harvest time moves were abbreviated impressively, from 6 to 13 September, and comprised just of activities in the North Sea. The main exercise assumed a maritime barricade in the German Bight, and the second imagined a threatening armada endeavoring to drive the protections of the Elbe. Amid the activities, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" won the Kaiser's "Schiesspreis" (Shooting Prize) for phenomenal gunnery in the I Squadron. In October, the ship was reassigned to the I Division of the II Squadron. Toward the beginning of December, the I and II Squadrons went on their normal winter journey, this opportunity to Danzig, where they touched base on 12 December. On the arrival trek to Kiel, the armada directed strategic activities. 

Over the winter of 1906â 07, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" experienced a noteworthy update in Kiel, which was finished before the finish of April. At this point, the most current s were coming into administration; alongside the s, these gave enough present day war vessels to make two full fight squadrons. Therefore, the "Heimatflotte" was renamed the "Hochseeflotte" (High Seas Fleet). Beginning on 13 May, real armada practices occurred in the North Sea and kept going until 8 June with a voyage around the Skagen into the Baltic. The armada started its standard summer journey to Norway in mid-July. The armada was available for the birthday of Norwegian King Haakon VII on 3 August. The German boats left the next day for Helgoland, to join practices being directed there. The armada was back in Kiel by 15 August, where arrangements for the fall moves started. On 22â 24 August, the armada partook in landing practices in EckernfÃ¶rde Bay outside Kiel. The moves were delayed from 31 August to 3 September when the armada facilitated vessels from Denmark and Sweden, alongside a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel. The moves continued on 8 September and endured five more days. 

A shorter time of dockyard work occurred from 7 December to 27 January 1908. She came back to the armada for the ordinary peacetime routine of preparing works out, and after the finish of the pre-winter moves, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was decommissioned in Kiel on 21 September. She was taken into the "Kaiserliche Werft" shipyard in Kiel for a broad modernization that endured until 1910. Amid the refit, four of the ship's 15Â cm weapons and the stern-mounted torpedo tube were evacuated. Two 8.8Â cm firearms were included and the course of action of the 8.8Â cm battery was adjusted. Her superstructure was additionally chopped down to lessen the ship's propensity to roll too much, and the ship's pipes were extended. After recreation, the ship was appointed to the Reserve Division in the Baltic, alongside her sister ships. She was reactivated on 31 July 1911 and doled out to the III Squadron amid the yearly armada works out, at that point returned on 15 September to the Reserve Division. She stayed there for the remainder of her peacetime vocation. 

Because of the episode of World War I, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" and her sisters were brought out of hold and activated as the V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914. The boats were set up for war all around gradually, and were not prepared for administration in the North Sea until the finish of August. They were at first entrusted with beach front guard, yet they served in this limit with respect to an exceptionally brief time. In mid-September, the V Squadron was exchanged to the Baltic, under the direction of Prince Heinrich. He at first intended to dispatch a noteworthy land and/or water capable strike against the Russians at Windau, yet a lack of transports constrained an update of the arrangement. Rather, the V Squadron was to convey the arrival drive, however this too was dropped after Heinrich got bogus reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse " and her sisters came back to Kiel the next day, landed the arrival power, and after that continued toward the North Sea, where they continued watchman send obligations. Prior as far as possible of the year, the V Squadron was indeed exchanged to the Baltic. 

Sovereign Heinrich requested an attack toward Gotland. On 26 December 1914, the warships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and after that left on the fight. After two days, the armada landed off Gotland to demonstrate the German banner, and was back in Kiel by 30 December. The squadron came back toward the North Sea for gatekeeper obligations, however was pulled back from bleeding edge administration in February 1915. Deficiencies of prepared groups in the High Seas Fleet, combined with the danger of working more seasoned ships in wartime, required the deactivation of "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" and her sisters. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" first went to Hamburg, where her team was diminished on 5 March. She was moved to Kiel on 30 April, where the remainder of her team were expelled. She was incapacitated and from there on utilized as a station deliver. The next year, the ship was utilized as a torpedo target send. In November 1918, Germany surrendered and marked the Armistice at CompiÃ¨gne that finished the battling.
