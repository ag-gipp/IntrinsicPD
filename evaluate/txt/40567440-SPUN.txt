Samuel Merrill Woodbridge 

The Reverend Samuel Merrill Woodbridge, D.D., LL.D. (April 5, 1819Â â June 23, 1905) was an American priest, scholar, creator, and school educator. An alum of New York University and the New Brunswick Theological Seminary, Woodbridge lectured for a long time as a pastor in the Reformed Church in America. Subsequent to settling in New Brunswick, New Jersey, he educated for a long time as teacher of clerical history and church government at the New Brunswick Theological Seminary, and for a long time as educator of "mysticism and reasoning of the human personality" at Rutgers College (presently Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey) in New Brunswick. Woodbridge later drove the New Brunswick theological college as Dean and President of the Faculty from 1883 to 1901. He was the writer of three books and a few distributed messages and addresses covering different parts of Christian confidence, philosophy, church history and government. 

Samuel Merrill Woodbridge was conceived April 5, 1819 in Greenfield, Massachusetts. He was the third of six kids destined to the Rev. Sylvester Woodbridge, D.D. (1790â 1863) and Elizabeth Gould (passed on in 1851). As indicated by a genealogical diagram distributed in "Munsey's Magazine" in 1907, Woodbridge was in the eleventh era of a group of ministers going back to the late fifteenth century. The most punctual pastor in this familial line, the Rev. John Woodbridge (conceived in 1493), was a supporter of John Wycliffe. 

Woodbridge went to New York University, accepting a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) degree in 1838. As an undergrad understudy, Woodbridge was an individual from the college's shrouded, all-male Eucleian Society and was chosen to Phi Beta Kappa. He was granted a Master of Arts (A.M.) from the New Brunswick Theological Seminary in 1841 and was introduced as a clergyman by the Reformed Church's Classis of New York, an administering body directing places of worship inside the locale. As of now, his "institute of matriculation", New York University, elevated his four year college education to a Master of Arts. After his graduation from theological school, he filled in as minister at the South Reformed Dutch Church in South Brooklyn (1841â 49), at the Second Reformed Church in Coxsackie, New York (1849â 52), and at the Second Reformed Church in New Brunswick, New Jersey (1852â 57). 

In December 1857, Woodbridge was delegated to the workforce of two schools in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He would serve 44 years as a teacher of religious history and church government at New Brunswick Theological Seminary (from 1857 to 1901) and for a long time as an educator of "Transcendentalism and Philosophy of the Human Mind" at Rutgers College (from 1857 to 1864). The two schools were then associated with the Protestant Dutch Reformed confidence. He was delegated by the Synod to an opening in both professorates brought about by the passing of the Rev. John Ludlow, D.D. (1793â 1857), on September 8, 1857. Amid his residency at the theological school, Woodbridge likewise given guidance in the territories of peaceful, instructional and questioning philosophyâfrequently when there were opportunities among the personnel. 

In 1883, the congregation's General Synod chose that the "most established teacher in administration in the Theological Seminary at New Brunswick be styled Dean of the Seminary, and to him will be depended the order of the Institution, as per such guidelines as might be settled upon by the Faculty." Woodbridge drove the theological school as its first Dean of the Seminary, and in this way as President of the Faculty until his retirement in 1901. The two positions were antecedents to the present theological school president. Amid his profession, Woodbridge got privileged degrees from Union College (D.D. 1858) and from Rutgers College (A.M., 1841; D.D., 1857; LL.D. 1883). He resigned from educating in 1901 as an emeritus educator, at 82 years old. 

Woodbridge wedded twice. His first marriage was to Caroline Bergen (who passed on in 1861) in February 1845; the couple had one little girl, Caroline Woodbridge (conceived in 1845). On December 20, 1866 he wedded his second spouse, Anna Wittaker Dayton (1823â 1920), with whom he had two little girls, Anna Dayton Woodbridge (conceived in 1869) and Mary Elizabeth Woodbridge (conceived in 1872). 

Woodbridge kicked the bucket at 86 years old on June 23, 1905 in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He was entombed in a family plot in the Elmwood Cemetery, North Brunswick, New Jersey. Church student of history Charles Edward Corwin recorded that Woodbridge was depicted as having a solid identity that "made dry subjects to shine with life," including that he "was firm in the confidence yet his cherishing heart made him mercifully even toward those whose assessment he thought about hazardous."
