The player controls Turok, a Native American warrior, who must prevent the abhorrent Campaigner from overcoming the universe with an antiquated and amazing weapon. 

As Acclaim's first title for the Nintendo 64, "Turok" was a piece of a system to create amusements inside and permit stock; Acclaim obtained the rights to "Turok" when it bought Valiant Comics in 1994, renaming it Acclaim Comics. Experiencing income issues and falling deals, Acclaim came to depend on "Turok" as its best trust in a money related turnaround. Iguana pushed the Nintendo 64's illustrations capacities as far as possible, and were compelled to pack or slice components to fit the diversion on its 8 megabyte cartridge. Bugs deferred the amusement's discharge from September 1996 to January 1997. 

Basic gathering of "Turok" was exceedingly positive. Getting to be a standout amongst the most well known recreations for the reassure on discharge, "Turok" won recognition for its illustrations and advancement of the class. Grumblings focused on graphical stoppages brought about by numerous adversaries showing up onscreen and once in a while unbalanced controls. The diversion sold 1.5Â million duplicates and helped offers of the Nintendo 64. "Turok" brought forth a computer game establishment that incorporates an immediate continuation, titled "", in 1998, and a prequel, "", in 2002. A remastered adaptation of the amusement by Night Dive Studios was discharged through computerized dissemination for Microsoft Windows on December 17, 2015, trailed by a Xbox One discharge on March 2, 2018 and a Nintendo Switch discharge on March 18, 2019. 

Played from a first individual point of view, the three-dimensional (3D) PC illustrations and style of play consolidate components of the run-and-weapon PC diversion "Fate" with investigation mechanics of "Tomb Raider". Players start the amusement in a focal center dimension, which contains entryways to seven different stages. The player must discover keys dissipated over the stages. At the point when enough keys have been embedded into the lock systems of a center entrance, that dimension is opened. Players investigate the huge, ordinarily wilderness based dimensions by hopping, swimming, climbing, slithering, and running. 

One of the player's primary destinations is to discover bits of a relic known as the Chronoscepter; there is one piece on each dimension. In investigating the dimensions the player battles different adversaries, for example, poachers, shooters, indigenous warriors, dinosaurs, evil spirits, and creepy crawlies. "Turok" highlights 13Â weapons in addition to the Chronoscepter, extending from a blade and bow to cutting edge weaponry. All weapons with the exception of the blade require ammo, which is dropped by dead foes or got in the dimensions. Adversaries and supervisor characters have numerous passing movements relying upon what body district the player shot. Since things dropped by fallen adversaries quickly vanish, players must connect with enemies from short proximity. 

The player character's wellbeing is appeared as a number at the base of the screen. At the point when the player is at full wellbeing, the meter peruses 100, while dropping to 0 subtracts one life. Social occasion "life drive" focuses dissipated over the dimensions expands the player's life check by one for each 100 points aggregated. Players reestablish their wellbeing by grabbing powerups, which can expand their wellbeing above full. Players may likewise pick up wellbeing focuses by shooting deer or non-compromising natural life. 

The player expect control of Tal'Set (Turok), a Native American time-traveling warrior. The mantle of Turok is passed down each age to the oldest male. Each Turok is accused of securing the obstruction among Earth and the Lost Land, a crude reality where time has no importance. The Lost Land is occupied by an assortment of animals, from dinosaurs to outsiders. An abhorrent overlord known as the Campaigner looks for an antiquated ancient rarity known as the Chronoscepter, a weapon so ground-breaking that it was broken into pieces to keep it from falling into the wrong hands. The Campaigner anticipates utilizing a centering cluster to amplify the Chronoscepter's capacity, obliterating the obstructions that different the times of time and standard the universe. Turok promises to discover the Chronoscepter's eight pieces and keep the Campaigner's plans. 

Turok initially showed up in funnies from Western Publishing and Dell Comics in December 1954. Valiant Comics resuscitated the arrangement and distributed the principal issue of their "Turok" arrangement in 1993. Computer game distributer Acclaim Entertainment purchased Valiant for $65 million of every 1994 and obtained designer Iguana Entertainment for $5 million or more stock a year later, some portion of a system to create diversions in-house and make cash permitting characters in various stimulation media. "Turok" was reported in August 1994 as a select title for Nintendo's arranged "Ultra 64" comfort, in the end called the Nintendo 64. 

Advancement of "Turok" initiated in 1996. While approximately dependent on the comic book, Iguana made the amusement more activity arranged. In early talks about the undertaking the designers chose that the run of the mill side-looking over amusement introduction had turned out to be drained. Iguana considered a third-individual viewpoint like "Super Mario 64" and "Tomb Raider", yet chose to make the diversion a first-individual shooter. As per venture director David Dienstbier, the primary individual point of view was a characteristic method to grandstand the 3D intensity of the Nintendo 64. While the improvement group profited by Acclaim's clout as a long-term Nintendo supporter, getting prior criticism from the distributer and more eye to eye time amid creation, the greater part of the designers at Iguana were new and unpracticed; "Turok" was Dienstbier's first title. Because of the diversion's activity and vicious substance, Dienstbier trusted they were pushing the breaking points of what Nintendo would permit on their comfort, however Nintendo never requested to see or endorse anything in the amusement. 

The Nintendo 64 stage had better preparing capacities analyzed than most PCs accessible at the time, yet in addition accompanied difficulties. "The [Nintendo 64] can do a great deal of stuff," Dienstbier said. "On the off chance that you need to deal with extravagant molecule lighting, and straightforwardness impacts, and you need to toss around tremendous measures of mathÂ ... or then again geometry onscreen, it has the preparing capacity to do that, and yes it's an incredible machine. Be that as it may, considering it a designer's fantasy kinda gives you the feeling that it's anything but difficult to wrench out a diversion like "Turok", and it's unquestionably not." While Nintendo was steady, Iguana needed to deliver all its amusement improvement apparatuses inside. Fitting the diversion on its 8 MB cartridge was troublesome; at last, Iguana needed to pack everything and diminish the nature of the music to meet size prerequisites. In spite of framework limitations the engineers were keen on creating the most attractive computer game for the framework: the diversion utilized constant lighting impacts and molecule frameworks for included authenticity. Iguana had the capacity to utilize Acclaim's cutting edge movement catch studio, permitting humanoid characters to move easily and in a persuading way; movement catch eased the issues of Iguana's restricted assets and tight timetable. A stand-in recorded developments for the human characters; while the designers attempted to utilize emus and ostriches for the dinosaurs, the outcomes were just utilized as reference material. 

At the time, Acclaim Entertainment was in monetary peril. The organization was a noteworthy distributer in the 16 bit time of amusements, however the organization's deals endured as it was moderate to relocate from more seasoned diversion frameworks like the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System to cutting edge stages. The organization lost $222 million in the 1996 monetary year because of offers tumbling to $162 million contrasted with $567 million the earlier year; in the primary quarter of financial 1997, the organization lost a further $19 million. The organization laid off 100 of its 950 specialists since March 1996 and its stock had dropped from a high of $13.875 an offer to as low as $3. "Turok", Acclaim's first Nintendo 64 title, turned into the organization's best any expectation of a turnaround, as there were just ten Nintendo 64 amusements available, and "Turok" was the main shooter. "Turok" was the main major Nintendo 64 programming exhibited at the September 1996 European Computer Trade Show, with Nintendo themselves missing from the show. Alex. Dark colored Inc examiners assumed that offering one million duplicates of "Turok" could bring Acclaim as much as $45 million. Because of income issues, a great part of the cash got ready for showcasing "Turok" was dependent upon solid offers of "". Jeopardizing "Turok"s deals was its high costâ$79.99 in the US, Â£70 in the UK, and $129.95 in Australiaâand Entertainment Software Rating Board's "develop" rating, which recommended lower deals as guardians would not purchase the amusement for their kids. 

Following the amusement's prosperity, Sculptured Software (another of Acclaim's inward studios) led tests to check whether "Turok: Dinosaur Hunter" could be dependably changed over to the PlayStation. 

Initially slated for a September 30, 1996 discharge in North America, the amusement was at first deferred to January 1997. Recognition clarified that the diversion had not achieved the ideal quality dimension; Nintendo kept up that the deferral was to "add more profundity to the ongoing interaction". As indicated by "The New York Times", the postpone originated from PC bugs in the program. Recognition intensely advertised "Turok" on the fronts of video-gaming magazines and in TV plugs for the Nintendo 64. Recognition gave news sources, for example, "The Mirror" tweaked "Turok"- marked amusement consoles to give away in sweepstakes. Reacting to positive pre-requests and advance offers of "Turok", Acclaim reported on January 2, 1997 that a continuation, likely titled "", would be discharged in late 1997. Recognition named the March 4 discharge date of the diversion "Turok Tuesday", detailing that pre-deals at Toys "R" Us had surpassed desires. Recognition stock expanded in expectation before the amusement's discharge, up $0.62 to $5.94. 

"Turok" was a basic and business achievement, winning rave audits from computer game magazines and turning into the most mainstream title for the Nintendo 64 in the months following its discharge. On the total survey sites Metacritic and GameRankings, the support form of "Turok" has a 85% and 86.6% rating, separately, each figure dependent on scores from thirteen contemporary and late audits. 

Douglass Perry of the sight and sound site IGN looked at "Turok" positively to other first individual shooters, saying that the title separated itself by permitting a dimension of 3D development unrealistic in different individuals from the class. Startling Larry of "GamePro", who gave "Turok" an ideal score in every one of the four classes (control, funfactor, illustrations, and sound), also said "Turok has more capability, more power over its condition, and more grim designs than other hallway shooters." While concurring that the amusement offers more noteworthy opportunity of development, a "People to come" analyst opined that first-individual platforming does not work since the player can't see their character. He discovered this unequivocally stood out from the diversion's "choice" shooting components. "The Australian"s Steve Polak composed that while "Turok" was very subordinate, the amusement was proof of the advancement of the class, offering more illustrations and ongoing interaction choices. Computer game magazine "Edge" said that "Turok" negated the common idea at the time that no one but Nintendo could make predominant recreations for the comfort. Conversely, William Burrill of "The Toronto Star" composed that "Turok" offered just the same old thing new if players had attempted a first-individual shooter previously, and "Cutting edge Online" said that its comparable ongoing interaction basically made the amusement "a beautiful "Duke Nukem"". The four commentators of "Electronic Gaming Monthly" commented that while the illustrations and liveliness are staggering, the controls and level structure are deficient. Addressing Shacknews in 2007, Propaganda Games' Josh Holmes said that while "GoldenEye 007" is normally viewed as the standard-setting console shooter, "Turok" spearheaded the reassure shooter first by offering open situations and going astray from the hallway based shooters that were the standard up to that point. 

Analysts found that "Turok"s controls by and large functioned admirably. Perry, Scary Larry, and "People to come" all prominent that while numerous players would not at first like utilizing the Nintendo 64's simple stick for weapon development, they would wind up skilled at the control conspire. The "Electronic Gaming Monthly" survey group, in any case, said they wished the controls could be reconfigured to a plan that was simpler to ace. Polak composed that the joystick let players point with a surprising measure of exactness. George Mannes of "The Daily News" observed the controls to be anything but difficult to learn and easy to monitor in contrast with PC shooters, however said the joystick control could be confusing: "the main issue is the point at which you gaze upward noticeable all around and make the scarcest jerk to one side or the right, you can finish up like a traveler gazing up at the Empire State Building and spinning like a dervish," he composed. Commentators found that the amusement's incorporated instructional exercise helped players adjust to the controls. 

Pundits praised "Turok"s designs; while giving the remainder of the diversion a lukewarm reaction, Burrill and the "EGM" group both evaluated the visuals profoundly. Polak said that the diversion demonstrated the amazingness of the Nintendo 64's illustrations in the comfort showcase. Translucent water, destructible trees and focal point flares were among the graphical subtleties adulated by commentators. "The Washington Post"s Tom Ham said that "similarly noteworthy" as the natural detail were the "consistent with life" activitys. "Overwhelm a baddie and he'll get his throat, blood splatting, and after that tumble to the ground, as yet shaking," Ham composed. "How might you put a cost on that?" Scary Larry concurred that the grisly passing livelinesss are a feature of the inside and out noteworthy designs. The dimension of violence and blood in the amusement lead commentators, for example, Scary Larry, "The Times"s Tim Wapshott, and "The Washington Times"s Joseph Szadkowski to alert against giving kids a chance to play the diversion. GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann noticed that the illustrations included some significant downfalls; if in excess of a couple of foes showed up on screen in the meantime, the amusement's casing rate would back off. Gerstmann composed that the separation haze used to decrease the log jam was a "slick impact" as foes would show up out of the fog "teeth first", in spite of the fact that it covered the reassure's constraints. Perry remarked that the failure to investigate the separation constrained players to depend on the diversion map. "People to come" said that while "Turok" was in general likely the most attractive Nintendo 64 diversion to date, the restricted surface palette makes every one of the conditions seem comparative, making the amusement perplexing notwithstanding the guide. 

The PC port was not also gotten. Colin Williamson remarked in "PC Gamer" that the diversion's notoriety on the Nintendo 64 could to some extent be ascribed to the deficiency of amusements for the framework at the time. Like "People to come", he said that while the illustrations are amazing, the restricted surfaces and consistent haze make the amusement bewildering, and first-individual stage hopping does not work. He included that the diversion's issues are aggravated on PC in light of the fact that the transformation neglected to add on highlights that PC gamers underestimate, for example, a multiplayer mode and capacity to spare anytime. "GameSpot"s Tim Soete in like manner scrutinized the PC rendition's maintenance of the issues and checkpoint-based spare arrangement of the Nintendo 64 adaptation, however he had a general positive response to the amusement, calling it "an actually capturing experience." Steve Bauman of "PC Games Magazine" looked into the PC form and said that while it was a fantastic port, the diversion itself was substandard compared to different shooters, for example, "Tremor". 

Overall offers of "Turok: Dinosaur Hunter" outperformed $60 million in late June 1997. The amusement likewise held the top spot for computer game rentals for seven weeks continuously. Recognition re-issued the amusement for the 1997 Christmas season because of its business potential for the expanded comfort player base. "Turok" was later named a Nintendo "Player's Choice" title in 1998âthe main outsider Nintendo 64 diversion to be highlighted at the timeâand at last sold about 1.5Â million units. 

"NGC Magazine" composed that "Turok" changed impression of a Nintendo reassure: "On a machine from an organization that had since quite a while ago had practical experience in essential hues and family fun, the exact opposite thing anybody foreseen was the sort of bleeding edge first-individual shooter that was already the sole safeguard of costly gaming PCs." Not just did "Turok" change this, yet it built up a "framework selling establishment" that persevered even after the N64 was supplanted. Notwithstanding "Turok", the "Turok" establishment incorporates five different amusements: "" (1998), "" (1999), "" (2000), "" (2002), and "Turok" (2008). 

It was declared in August 2015 that Night Dive Studios was delivering a remastered form of the diversion, alongside "Turok 2", for the PC. The amusement will incorporate improved illustrations just as "different upgrades" in light of the first PC ports of the titles. The remaster was discharged in advanced stores on December 17, 2015. In March 2016, Night Dive Studios affirmed that the diversion would be discharged for the Xbox One computer game reassure. 

In February 2017, the source code of the N64 adaptation was sold on Ebay for $2551.99 which was found on a SGI Silicon Graphics Indy improvement machine which started from the Acclaim Entertainment liquidation. 

The remastered amusement was discharged on March 18, 2019 for the Nintendo Switch.
