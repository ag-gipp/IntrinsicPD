The vampire later discloses to Gordon that seekers slaughtered his home, and now he needs to remake his family. In spite of the fact that Dixon had moved toward utilizing Gordon as sustenance, the seeker's nonstop provoking prompts him to sustain him his blood. At the point when the siblingsâhaving been educated by Bela of Gordon's area, which she found through Ouija boardâtouch base at Dixon's refuge, they find that the vampiric Gordon has gotten away. Somewhere else, Gordon comes back to Kubrick. He demands that he be permitted to live sufficiently long to manage Sam. In spite of this, Kubrick endeavors to slaughter him, so Gordon strikes back by punching into his guts. 

As night approaches, the siblings have not had the capacity to discover Gordon. Dignitary chooses to follow Gordon while Sam remains covered up, however Sam won't.

"New Blood" highlighted the last visitor appearance by Sterling K. Darker as the vampire seeker Gordon Walker. The character's story curve for the season was expected to be longer, yet Brown's responsibilities to the Lifetime Television arrangement "Armed force Wives" constrained his arrival to just two appearances. The scene was "actually hard" for the performing artist; however he approved of the character passing on, the possibility of Gordon transforming a guiltless young lady into a vampire was "horrendous" to him. In spite of the fact that Gordon's activities in past scenes were faulty, Brown had dependably trusted the character to be "at last great". On this change, Brown remarked, "His endgame is to murder Sam, and any other individual who needs to encounter hindering impacts in view of that isn't a worry of his. That was intense for me to process and get energetic about." However, arrangement maker Eric Kripke contemplated that the character was presently a beast and ought to pursue his senses rather than rationale. The author of "New Blood", Sera Gamble, likewise wrote Gordon's underlying scene and aided Kripke conceptualize the character. She felt that she "got lucky" in having the capacity to compose the character's last appearance, and observed there to be "something so fulfilling about transforming him into a vampire and cleaving his head off with a razor wire". 

Mercedes McNab, understood for depicting the vampire Harmony Kendall on the TV arrangement "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Heavenly attendant", visitor featured as the as of late turned vampire Lucy. Albeit reluctant to play another vampire, McNab came to understand that the character was to a lesser extent a vampire and to a greater extent a "young lady who woke up and was essentially medicated or was changed and didn't have an inkling what was happening". The performing artist additionally noticed that Harmony was commonly utilized for entertainment, though Lucy was expected to be "not kidding and increasingly sensational". Her past involvement with executive Kim Manners on the TV arrangement "The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr." likewise impacted her choice. Since a large number of her ongoing characters would in general pass on, McNab was enchanted by Lucy's offscreen demise. The on-screen character was likewise taking a shot at a scene of "Gatherer" amid the taping of "Crisp Blood", and the "Heavenly" creation staff had the capacity to accommodate her into the shooting plan. The on-screen character observed them to be "extremely useful" in ensuring that her scenes did not take too long to even think about filming. Her part of the opening scene just took a couple of hours to shoot, enabling her to come back to "Harvester" the following morning. 

Michael Massee returned as the seeker Kubrick, who trusts himself to be on a mission from God to execute Sam Winchester. Massee talked about his character with Brown previously, and imagined him as a long-lasting companion of Gordon who could be relied on. Darker portrayed Kubrick as a "well-meaning...sweet fellow", and noticed that his better half had an "instinctive reaction" to the character's demise when later survey the scene. Matthew Humphreys depicted the vampire Dixon, and thinks of him as a "profoundly misconstrued" character. The on-screen character thought that it was "anything but difficult to legitimize what he did" in light of the fact that Dixon was inconsistent with how to begin his very own family as a vampire, and he keeps up that the character had no shrewd goals behind his activities. Humphreys would like to one day come back to the job. 

Primary photography occurred in Vancouver, British Columbia. The opening arrangement was shot outside during the evening, however the ensuing sceneâLucy's cross examination and executionâhappened in a motel set built on a sound stage. Atypical to the arrangement, the motel room did not have a discernible topic. Creation fashioner John Marcynuk remarked, "That motel room was basically an executing floor for the boys...and it was somewhat of a cool cross examination scene, so we attempted to keep it not all that well disposed. When you strolled through it, it unquestionably felt like a spot [where] a homicide had been submitted. It wouldn't have been the first run through a homicide had been submitted in that room, either. It was the sort of spot where terrible things occur." Marcynuk adopted an alternate strategy for Gordon's demise scene, using green tones and a cool shading palette to make a more noteworthy visual appear differently in relation to the blood. 

To loan a solid demeanor of authenticity to Gordon's demise, the scene was made by consolidating different enhancements amid taping with after creation special visualizations. Plastic razor wire with blood tubing supported in the underlying periods of the execution; it would marginally sink into Brown's neck as weight was connected, driving out the phony blood. For the consequence, Brown set down on the floor, and the enhanced visualizations office expelled his head from the shot and reproduced it as a three-dimensional model. The division chose to "push it somewhat more remote" by having the head shaking into spot and the mouth jerking, yet Standards and Practices discovered it excessively realistic and constrained them to expel the movement. Built up in the primary season scene "Dead Man's Blood" were the shark-like teeth of vampires, and the plan has been unpretentiously improved with every vampire scene. In spite of the fact that the embellishments cosmetics office utilized molds of the on-screen characters' mouths to make the fanged acrylic dentures, McNab noticed that it was hard to talk while wearing them. Blood-like cosmetics around the on-screen characters' mouths balanced the vampiric appearances. 

The combined instrumental score of the scene was composed by Christopher Lennertz. He feels that "individuals partner the sound of violins with vampires" due to the "association with Eastern Europe and tallies", and therefore utilized a "very violin-overwhelming" score for the scene, maintaining a strategic distance from woodwinds, metal, and piano. 

In its unique communicate, "New Blood" was seen by an expected 2.88 million watchers. The scene got commonly positive audits from faultfinders. Tina Charles of "television Guide" adulated the scene, remarking that "it was extremely pleasant to get a charming scene high on force, selfless association, violence". In spite of the fact that she had grown a "tiny bit fatigued" of the character's ceaseless endeavors to execute Sam, she was still "extremely sorry to learn Sterling and Gordy go". Charles felt that his change was a "decent wind", and loved that his "highly contrasting convictions" continued as before even in the wake of turning into a vampire. She likewise delighted in the character of Lucy and her "extremely miserable" finishing, and wanted that McNab's job had been bigger. It was noticed that the "selfless connection was up front", and Charles was "past glad" that Sam defied Dean about is conduct. The "minute that [she had] been sitting tight for throughout the entire season" at long last came to be when Dean paid attention to Sam and really tuned in to him as opposed to answering with mockery. Charles additionally considered the last scene with the siblings to be "simply grievous". Similarly, Karla Peterson of "The San Diego Union-Tribune" gave the scene an A+, however positioned it as the 6th best scene of the 2007-2008 TV season. She adulated author Sera Gamble and executive Kim Manners for "making the best holding scene we've had all season", and commended Padalecki and Ackles for "making us care so much and accept so completely that a scene like this can abandon us panting". 

Brett Love of "television Squad" placed that Gordon's arrival in the "incredible" scene was "certainly justified regardless of the pause". He noticed that the disclosure that Lucy was only an honest young lady was a "pleasant wind", and regarded it an "incredible decision" to have Gordon transformed into a vampire. Love was dismal to see Gordon withdraw from the arrangement, finding the "extraordinary" Brown to be "so extreme and submitted" to the job. Be that as it may, he believed Bela's appearance to be superfluous, and brought up its impossibility being simpler for Gordon to find Bela than it would have been to simply find the Winchesters. Like Love, Julie Pyle of "Sealed area Alpha" trusted Bela's appearance "[felt] constrained". She was disheartened by the passings of Gordon and Kubrick, and had trusted that their storylines would have been additionally investigated. Pyle likewise scrutinized the scene's lighting, remarking, "With the additional violence this season, the show ought to appear to be darker. Rather, it resembles "Powerful" Lite." While Maureen Ryan of "Chicago Tribune" found the idea of Gordon chasing down Sam to be "propelled", she noticed that "'Fresh Blood' didn't do much for [her]". 

Reviewing the evil presence Azazel's remarks about the as of late restored Sam in the scene "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part Two"â that what returned may not be "100% unadulterated Sam"â Don Williams of BuddyTV addressed if something truly isn't right with Sam. Williams added Gordon's demise to his rundown of Sam's ongoing unusual activities, which effectively incorporated Sam's merciless execution of Jake Talley in "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part Two" and his killing of the Crossroads Demon in "Sleep time Stories". In any case, he pointed out that the two characters "sort of had the right to fail miserably". Peterson, as well, noticed the "chilly, dead look in Sam's eyes" after the executing. Then again, Padalecki set that the "darker side of Sam" was delineated when he murdered Gordon "with unadulterated disdain", however contemplated that Sam was considering, "He's a vampire! He's killing individuals; it's the ideal opportunity for him to go."
