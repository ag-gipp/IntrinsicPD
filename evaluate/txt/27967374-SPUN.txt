A Happy Place 

"A Happy Place" is a tune performed by the Georgian-conceived, British artist Katie Melua and the second single from her fourth studio collection The House. It was discharged on 12 July 2010, highlighting a remix of the track by Sparks. 

The video itself was taped in a paternoster lift in Haus des Rundfunks, Berlin. The steady development of the lift and one's failure to stop it speak to the consistent stream of life. The cap Melua wears in the video was made by a milliner called Piers Atkinson. 

In a meeting with the Sun Melua disclosed concerning the video: "It was tied in with discovering harmony inside yourself regardless of how much life is streaming justified or misguided course."
