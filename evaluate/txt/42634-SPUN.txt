The Dark Side of the Moon 

The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio collection by English musical crew Pink Floyd, discharged on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. Principally created amid live exhibitions, the band debuted an early form of the record a while before account started. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London. 

The record expands on thoughts investigated in Pink Floyd's before chronicles and exhibitions, while discarding the all-inclusive instrumentals that described their before work. An idea collection, its subjects investigate struggle, insatiability, time, passing, and psychological maladjustment, the last incompletely roused by the decaying strength of establishing part Syd Barrett, who left the gathering in 1968. The gathering utilized propelled recording strategies at the time, including multitrack recording, tape circles, and simple synthesizers. Bits from meetings with the band's street group, just as philosophical citations, were additionally utilized. Architect Alan Parsons was in charge of numerous sonic perspectives and the enlistment of vocalist Clare Torry, who shows up on "The Great Gig in the Sky". The notable sleeve, which portrays a crystal range, was structured by Storm Thorgerson, following keyboardist Richard Wright's solicitation for a "straightforward and intense" plan, speaking to the band's lighting and the record's topics. The collection was advanced with two singles: "Cash" and "Us and Them". 

"The Dark Side of the Moon" got basic approval upon discharge, and has since been hailed by pundits as one of the best collections ever. The record achieved number one on the US "Bulletin 200", and has graphed for more than 900 weeks altogether. With assessed offers of more than 45 million duplicates, it is Pink Floyd's smash hit, and a standout amongst the top rated collections around the world. The record impelled Pink Floyd to global distinction, conveying riches and acknowledgment to every one of the four of its individuals. It has been remastered and re-discharged on a few events, most as of late for advanced dissemination. 

Following "Interfere" in 1971, Pink Floyd amassed for a voyage through Britain, Japan and the United States in December of that year. In a band meeting at drummer Nick Mason's home in Camden, bassist Roger Waters suggested that another collection could shape some portion of the visit. Waters' thought was for a collection that managed things that "make individuals distraught", concentrating on the weights looked by the band amid their challenging way of life, and managing the evident mental issues endured by previous band part Syd Barrett. The band had investigated a comparable thought with 1969's "The Man" and "The Journey". In a meeting for "Moving Stone", guitarist David Gilmour stated: "I think we as a whole suspected â and Roger certainly thought â that a great deal of the verses that we had been utilizing were excessively backhanded. There was certainly an inclination that the words would have been extremely clear and explicit." 

For the most part, every one of the four individuals concurred that Waters' collection idea brought together by a solitary topic was a smart thought. Waters, Gilmour, Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright partook in the composition and generation of the new material, and Waters made the early demo tracks at his Islington home in a little studio worked in his patio nursery shed. Portions of the new collection were taken from already unused material; the opening line of "Inhale" originated from a prior work by Waters and Ron Geesin, composed for the soundtrack of "The Body", and the fundamental structure of "Us and Them" acquired from a unique piece by Wright for "Zabriskie Point". The band practiced at a distribution center in London claimed by The Rolling Stones, and after that at the Rainbow Theater in Finsbury Park, London. They additionally bought additional hardware, which included new speakers, a PA framework, a 28-track blending work area with a four channel quadraphonic yield, and a custom-fabricated lighting rig. Nine tons of pack was transported in three lorries; this would be the first run through the band had taken a whole collection on visit. The collection had been given the temporary title of "Clouded Side of the Moon" (a reference to lunacy, instead of cosmology). Notwithstanding, subsequent to finding that that title had just been utilized by another band, Medicine Head, it was briefly changed to "Obscuration". The new material premiÃ¨red at The Dome in Brighton, on 20 January 1972, and after the business disappointment of Medicine Head's collection the title was changed back to the band's unique inclination. 

"Clouded Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics", as it was then known, was performed within the sight of a collected press on 17 February 1972 â over a year prior to its discharge â at the Rainbow Theater, and was widely praised. Michael Wale of "The Times" portrayed the piece as "conveying tears to the eyes. It was so totally understanding and musically addressing." Derek Jewell of "The Sunday Times" expressed "The aspiration of the Floyd's creative aim is presently immense." "Tune Maker" was less energetic: "Musically, there were some incredible thoughts, yet the audio effects frequently abandoned me thinking about whether I was in a fowl confine at London zoo." The accompanying visit was adulated by people in general. The new material was performed in a similar request in which it was in the long run recorded; contrasts incorporated the absence of synthesizers in tracks, for example, "On the Run", and Bible readings supplanted by Clare Torry's vocals on "The Great Gig in the Sky". 

Pink Floyd's long visit through Europe and North America allowed them the chance to make constant upgrades to the scale and nature of their exhibitions. Work on the collection was hindered in late February when the band ventured out to France and recorded music for French executive Barbet Schroeder's film "La VallÃ©e". They at that point performed in Japan and came back to France in March to finish chip away at the film. After a progression of dates in North America, the band traveled to London to start recording, from 24 May to 25 June. More shows in Europe and North America pursued before the band returned on 9 January 1973 to finish the collection. 

"The Dark Side of the Moon" based upon tests Pink Floyd had endeavored in their past live shows and accounts, yet comes up short on the all-encompassing instrumental journeys which, as indicated by pundit David Fricke, had turned out to be normal for the band in the wake of establishing part Syd Barrett left in 1968. Gilmour, Barrett's substitution, later alluded to those instrumentals as "that hallucinogenic noodling stuff", and with Waters refered to 1971's "Intrude" as a defining moment towards what might be acknowledged on the collection. "The Dark Side of the Moon"s melodious topics incorporate clash, covetousness, the progression of time, passing, and craziness, the last roused to a limited extent by Barrett's disintegrating mental state. The collection contains musique concrÃ¨te on a few tracks. 

Each side of the collection is a consistent bit of music. The five tracks on each side reflect different phases of human life, starting and consummation with a heartbeat, investigating the idea of the human experience, and (as indicated by Waters) "sympathy". "Address Me" and "Inhale" together pressure the ordinary and worthless components of life that go with the ever-present risk of franticness, and the significance of carrying on with one's own life â "Don't be reluctant to mind". By moving the scene to an air terminal, the synthesizer-driven instrumental "On the Run" inspires the pressure and nervousness of current travel, specifically Wright's dread of flying. "Time" analyzes the way in which its section can control one's life and offers an unmistakable cautioning to the individuals who stay concentrated on ordinary angles; it is trailed by a retreat into isolation and withdrawal in "Inhale (Reprise)". The principal side of the collection closes with Wright and vocalist Clare Torry's heartfelt allegory for death, "The Great Gig in the Sky". 

Opening with the sound of money enrolls and spare change, the principal track on side two, "Cash", taunts covetousness and industrialism utilizing flippant verses and money related audio cues. "Cash" turned into the most economically fruitful track, and has been secured by a few demonstrations. "Us and Them" addresses the confinement of the discouraged with the imagery of contention and the utilization of straightforward divisions to portray individual connections. "Any Color You Like" concerns the absence of decision one has in a human culture. "Mind Damage" takes a gander at a dysfunctional behavior coming about because of the height of notoriety and accomplishment over the requirements of oneself; specifically, the line "and if the band you're in begins playing distinctive tunes" mirrors the psychological breakdown of previous bandmate Syd Barrett. The collection closes with "Obscuration", which upholds the ideas of alterity and solidarity, while driving the audience to perceive the regular attributes shared by mankind. 

The collection was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, in two sessions, between May 1972 and January 1973. The band were doled out staff engineer Alan Parsons, who had filled in as right hand tape administrator on "Particle Heart Mother", and who had likewise picked up involvement as a chronicle engineer on the Beatles' "Monastery Road" and "Let It Be". The chronicle sessions utilized probably the most developed studio methods of the time; the studio was equipped for 16-track blends, which offered a more prominent level of adaptability than the eight-or four-track blends they had recently utilized, despite the fact that the band regularly utilized such huge numbers of tracks that to make more space accessible second-age duplicates were made. 

Starting on 1 June, the main track to be recorded was "Us and Them", pursued six days after the fact by "Cash". Waters had made impacts circles from chronicles of different cash related items, including coins tossed into a sustenance blending bowl taken from his better half's stoneware studio, and these were later re-recorded to exploit the band's choice to record a quadraphonic blend of the collection (Parsons has since communicated disappointment with the consequence of this blend, ascribed to an absence of time and the lack of accessible multi-track recording devices). "Time" and "The Great Gig in the Sky" were the following pieces to be recorded, trailed by a two-month break, amid which the band invested energy with their families and arranged for an up and coming voyage through the US. The account sessions endured customary intrusions; Waters, a supporter of Arsenal F.C., would regularly break to see his group contend, and the band would periodically stop work to watch "Monty Python's Flying Circus" on the TV, leaving Parsons to chip away at material recorded up to that point. Gilmour has, in any case, debated this case; in a meeting in 2003 he stated: "We would now and then watch them yet when we were having some fantastic luck, we would jump on." 

Coming back from the US in January 1973, they recorded "Mind Damage", "Overshadowing", "Any Color You Like" and "On the Run", while calibrating the work they had effectively set down in the past sessions. A foursome of female vocalists was collected to sing on "Cerebrum Damage", "Shroud" and "Time", and saxophonist Dick Parry was reserved to play on "Us and Them" and "Cash". With executive Adrian Maben, the band additionally taped studio film for "". When the chronicle sessions were finished, the band started a voyage through Europe. 

The collection highlights metronomic audio effects amid "Address Me", and tape circles opening "Cash". Artisan made a harsh adaptation of "Address Me" at his home, before finishing it in the studio. The track fills in as a suggestion and contains cross-blurs of components from different pieces on the collection. A piano harmony, replayed in reverse, serves to increase the development of impacts, which are promptly trailed by the opening of "Relax". Artisan got an uncommon solo creating credit for "Address Me". 

The audio cues on "Cash" were made by joining together Waters' chronicles of clunking coins, tearing paper, a ringing money register, and a clicking calculator, which were utilized to make a 7-beat impacts circle (later adjusted to four tracks so as to make a "stroll around the room" impact in quadraphonic introductions of the collection). Now and again the level of sonic experimentation on the collection required the designers and band to work the blending console's faders at the same time, so as to blend down the unpredictably gathered multitrack accounts of a few of the tunes (especially "On the Run"). 

Alongside the regular musical crew instrumentation, Pink Floyd added conspicuous synthesizers to their sound. For instance, the band explored different avenues regarding an EMS VCS 3 on "Cerebrum Damage" and "Any Color You Like", and a Synthi An on "Schedule" and "On the Run". They likewise conceived and recorded offbeat sounds, for example, an associate architect going around the studio's reverberation load (amid "On the Run"), and an uncommonly treated bass drum made to recreate a human heartbeat (amid "Address Me", "On the Run", "Time" and "Overshadowing"). This heartbeat is most noticeable as the introduction and the outro to the collection, however it can likewise be heard sporadically on "Schedule" and "On the Run". "Time" highlights grouped timekeepers ticking, at that point ringing all the while toward the beginning of the melody, joined by a progression of Rototoms. The accounts were at first made as a quadraphonic test by Parsons, who recorded every timepiece at an antique clock shop. In spite of the fact that these accounts had not been made explicitly for the collection, components of this material were in the long run utilized in the track. 

A few tracks, including "Us and Them" and "Time", showed Richard Wright's and David Gilmour's capacity to fit their voices. In the 2003 Classic Albums narrative "The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon", Waters credited this to the way that their voices sounded very comparative. To exploit this, Parsons used studio systems, for example, the twofold following of vocals and guitars, which permitted Gilmour to orchestrate with himself. The architect additionally utilized flanging and stage moving consequences for vocals and instruments, odd slyness with reverb, and the panning of sounds between channels (most remarkable in the quadraphonic blend of "On the Run", when the sound of the Hammond B3 organ played through a Leslie speaker quickly whirls around the audience). 

The collection's credits incorporate Clare Torry, a session artist and lyricist, and a standard at Abbey Road. She had dealt with pop material and various spread collections, and subsequent to hearing one of those collections Parsons welcomed her to the studio to sing on Wright's piece "The Great Gig in the Sky". She declined this welcome as she needed to watch Chuck Berry perform at the Hammersmith Odeon, however orchestrated to come in on the next Sunday. The band clarified the idea driving the collection, yet were unfit to advise her precisely what she ought to do. Gilmour was responsible for the session, and in a couple of short takes on a Sunday night Torry ad libbed a silent tune to go with Wright's emotive piano solo. She was at first humiliated by her extravagance in the account stall, and needed to apologize to the band â just to discover them charmed with her execution. Her takes were then specifically altered to deliver the adaptation utilized on the track. For her commitment she was paid Â£30, equal to about Â£ in 2019. In 2004, she sued EMI and Pink Floyd for half of the songwriting eminences, contending that her commitment to "The Great Gig in the Sky" was sufficiently generous to be viewed as co-creation. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed aggregate, with all post-2005 pressings crediting Wright and Torry mutually. 

Bits of voices between and over the music are another remarkable component of the collection. Amid account sessions, Waters enlisted both the staff and the brief tenants of the studio to respond to a progression of inquiries imprinted on cheat sheets. The interviewees were set before a receiver in an obscured Studio 3, and demonstrated such inquiries as "What's your most loved shading?" and "What's your most loved sustenance?", before proceeding onward to subjects increasingly integral to the collection, (for example, franticness, viciousness, and demise). Questions, for example, "When was the last time you were rough?", pursued quickly by "Were you justified?", were replied in the request they were introduced. Roger "The Hat" Manifold demonstrated hard to discover, and was the main patron recorded in a regular sit-down meeting, as by then the cheat sheets had been misplaced. Waters got some information about a savage experience he had with another driver, and Manifold answered "...Â give them a brisk, short, sharp shockÂ ..." When gotten some information about death he reacted "live for now, gone tomorrow, that is meÂ ..." Another roadie, Chris Adamson, who was on visit with Pink Floyd, recorded the bit which opens the collection: "I've been frantic for screwing years â totally years". The band's street administrator Peter Watts (father of performing artist Naomi Watts) contributed the rehashed chuckling amid "Cerebrum Damage" and "Address Me". His second spouse, Patricia "Puddie" Watts (presently Patricia Gleason), was in charge of the line about the "geezer" who was "cruisin' for a bruisin utilized in the segue among "Cash" and "Us and Them", and the words "I never said I was alarmed of biting the dust" heard part of the way through "The Great Gig in the Sky". 

Maybe the most striking reactions "I am not panicked of passing on. Whenever will do: I wouldn't fret. For what reason would it be advisable for me to be alarmed of kicking the bucket? There's no explanation behind itÂ â you must go at some point" and shutting words "there is no clouded side in the moon, truly. Truly it's everything dull" originated from the studios' Irish concierge, Gerry O'Driscoll. Paul and Linda McCartney were additionally met, however their answers were made a decision to be "making a decent attempt to be entertaining", and were excluded on the collection. McCartney's Wings bandmate Henry McCullough contributed the line "I don't have a clue, I was truly flushed at the time". 

Following the consummation of the exchange sessions, maker Chris Thomas was contracted to give "a crisp pair of ears". Thomas' experience was in music, instead of designing. He had worked with Beatles maker George Martin, and was familiar with Pink Floyd's director Steve O'Rourke. Every one of the four individuals from the band were occupied with a difference over the style of the blend, with Waters and Mason leaning toward a "dry" and "clean" blend which utilized the non-melodic components, and Gilmour and Wright favoring a subtler and that's just the beginning "echoey" blend. Thomas later asserted there were no such contradictions, expressing "There was no distinction in supposition between them, I don't recollect Roger once saying that he needed less reverberation. Indeed, there were never any clues that they were later going to drop out. It was an innovative air. A ton of fun." Although reality stays hazy, Thomas' intercession brought about an appreciated trade off among Waters and Gilmour, leaving both altogether happy with the final result. Thomas was in charge of critical changes to the collection, including the ideal planning of the reverberation utilized on "Us and Them". He was additionally present for the chronicle of "The Great Gig in the Sky" (in spite of the fact that Parsons was in charge of procuring Torry). Met in 2006, when inquired as to whether he felt his objectives had been cultivated in the studio, Waters stated: 

The collection was initially discharged in a gatefold LP sleeve structured by Hipgnosis and George Hardie. Hipgnosis had structured a few of the band's past collections, with dubious outcomes; EMI had responded with disarray when looked with the spread plans for "Particle Heart Mother" and "Darkened by Clouds", as they had expected to see customary plans which included lettering and words. Creators Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell had the capacity to overlook such analysis as they were utilized by the band. For "The Dark Side of the Moon", Richard Wright educated them to concoct something "more brilliant, neater â increasingly tasteful". The structure was motivated by a photo of a crystal with a shading shaft anticipated through it that Thorgerson had found in a photography book. 

The fine art was made by their partner, George Hardie. Hipgnosis offered the band a decision of seven plans, yet every one of the four individuals concurred that the crystal was by a long shot the best. The last structure delineates a glass crystal scattering light into shading. The plan speaks to three components: the band's stage lighting, the collection verses, and Wright's solicitation for a "basic and striking" structure. The range of light proceeds through to the gatefold â a thought that Waters concocted. Included in a matter of seconds a short time later, the gatefold configuration additionally incorporates a visual portrayal of the heartbeat sound utilized all through the collection, and the back of the collection spread contains Thorgerson's recommendation of another crystal recombining the range of light, encouraging intriguing designs of the sleeve with regards to record shops. The light band exuding from the crystal on the collection spread has six hues, missing indigo contrasted with the conventional division of the range into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. Inside the sleeve were two publications and two pyramid-themed stickers. One notice bore photos of the band in show, overlaid with dissipated letters to frame PINK FLOYD, and the other an infrared photo of the Great Pyramids of Giza, made by Powell and Thorgerson. 

The band were so certain of the nature of Waters' verses that, out of the blue, they printed them on the collection's sleeve. 

As the quadraphonic blend of the collection was not then total, the band (except for Wright) boycotted the press gathering held at the London Planetarium on 27 February. The visitors were, rather, given a group of four of life-sized cardboard patterns of the band, and the stereo blend of the collection was displayed through a low quality open location framework. For the most part, in any case, the press were energetic; "Tune Maker"s Roy Hollingworth depicted side one as "so completely mistook for itself it was hard to pursue", however commended side two, stating: "The tunes, the sounds, the rhythms were strong and sound, Saxophone hit the air, the band shook and rolled, and after that spouted and stumbled away into the night." Steve Peacock of "Sounds" expressed: "I couldn't care less in the event that you've never heard a note of the Pink Floyd's music in your life, I'd wholeheartedly prescribe everybody to "The Dark Side of the Moon"". In his 1973 survey for "Moving Stone" magazine, Loyd Grossman announced "Clouded Side" "a fine collection with a textural and theoretical extravagance that welcomes, yet requests association". In "" (1981), Robert Christgau discovered its expressive thoughts unoriginal and its music pompous, however considered it a "kitsch perfect work of art" that can be enchanting with features, for example, taped discourse sections, Parry's saxophone, and studio impacts which improve Gilmour's guitar performances. 

"The Dark Side of the Moon" was discharged first in the US on 1 March 1973, and after that in the UK on 16 March. It turned into a moment graph achievement in Britain and all through Western Europe; by the next month, it had picked up a gold confirmation in the US. All through March 1973 the band had the collection as impact of their US visit, including a midnight act at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 17 March before a crowd of people of 6,000. The collection came to the "Bulletin" Top LPs and Tape graph's main spot on 28 April 1973, and was successful to the point that the band returned two months after the fact for another visit. 

A significant part of the collection's initial American achievement is credited to the endeavors of Pink Floyd's US record organization, Capitol Records. Recently delegated administrator Bhaskar Menon begin attempting to switch the generally poor offers of the band's 1971 studio collection "Interfere". In the interim, disillusioned with Capitol, the band and supervisor O'Rourke had been discreetly arranging another agreement with CBS president Clive Davis, on Columbia Records. "The Dark Side of the Moon" was the last collection that Pink Floyd were obliged to discharge before formally marking another agreement. Menon's energy for the new collection was with the end goal that he started an immense limited time publicizing effort, which included radio-accommodating truncated variants of "Us and Them" and "Time". In certain nations â eminently the UK â Pink Floyd had not discharged a solitary since 1968's "Point Me at the Sky", and strangely "Cash" was discharged as a solitary on 7 May, with "Any Color You Like" on the B-side. It came to numberÂ 13 on the "Board" Hot 100 in July 1973. A two-sided white name limited time rendition of the single, with mono and stereo blends, was sent to radio stations. The mono side had "horse crap" expelled from the tune â leaving "bull" in its place â nonetheless, the stereo side held the uncensored form. This was along these lines pulled back; the substitution was sent to radio stations with a note instructing circle racers to arrange concerning the primary uncensored duplicate. On 4 February 1974, a twofold A-side single was discharged with "Time" on one side, and "Us and Them" on the contrary side. Menon's endeavors to verify an agreement recharging with Pink Floyd were futile in any case; toward the start of 1974, the band marked for Columbia with a detailed development charge of $1M (in Britain and Europe they kept on being spoken to by Harvest Records). 

"The Dark Side of the Moon" wound up a standout amongst the top of the line collections ever and is in the topÂ 25 of a rundown of top of the line collections in the United States. Despite the fact that it held the main spot in the US for just seven days, it stayed in the "Bulletin" collection outline for 741Â weeks from 1973 to 1988. The collection re-showed up on the "Announcement" graphs with the presentation of the Top Pop Catalog Albums diagram in May 1991, and has been an enduring element from that point forward. In the UK, it is the seventh-top rated collection ever and the most astounding offering collection never to achieve number one. 

In the US the LP was discharged before the presentation of platinum grants in 1976. It along these lines held just a gold circle until 16 February 1990, when it was ensured 11Ã platinum. On 4 June 1998 the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) ensured the collection 15Ã platinum, meaning offers of fifteen million in the United States â making it their greatest selling work there ("The Wall" is 23Ã platinum, however as a twofold collection this connotes offers of 11.5Â million). "Cash" has sold well as a solitary, and similarly as with "Time", remains a radio top choice; in the US, for the year finishing 20 April 2005, "Time" was played on 13,723Â occasions, and "Cash" on 13,731Â occasions. Industry sources propose that overall offers of the collection aggregate around 45 million. "On a moderate week" somewhere in the range of 8,000 and 9,000Â copies are sold, and an aggregate of 400,000 were sold in 2002, making it the 200th-top rated collection of that year â about three decades after its underlying discharge. The collection has sold 9,502,000 duplicates in the US since 1991 when Nielsen SoundScan started following deals for Billboard. Right up 'til today, it involves an unmistakable spot on "Billboard"s Pop Catalog Chart. It achieved number one when the 2003 crossover CD/SACD version was discharged and sold 800,000Â copies in the US. On the seven day stretch of 5 May 2006 "The Dark Side of the Moon" accomplished a consolidated aggregate of 1,716Â weeks on the "Billboard"Â 200 and Pop Catalog outlines. One in each fourteen individuals in the US under the age ofÂ 50 is assessed to claim, or to have possessed, a duplicate. Upon an adjustment in procedure in 2009 permitting list titles to be incorporated into the "Board" 200, "The Dark Side of the Moon" came back to the diagram at number 189 on 12 December of that year for its 742nd outlining week. It has proceeded to sporadically show up on the Billboard 200 from that point forward, with the aggregate at 942 weeks on the graph as of January 2019. 

"The mix of words and music hit a pinnacle," clarified Gilmour. "All the music before had not had any incredible expressive point to it. What's more, this one was clear and compact. The spread was additionally right. I believe it's turned out to resemble a generous noose hanging behind us. All through our whole profession, individuals have said we could never top the "Clouded Side" record and visit. In any case, "The Wall" earned more in dollar terms." 

In 1979, "The Dark Side of the Moon" was discharged as a remastered LP by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, and in April 1988 on their "Ultradisc" gold CD group. The collection was discharged by EMI on the then-new reduced plate position in 1984, and in 1992 it was re-discharged as a remastered CD in the container set "Sparkle On". This adaptation was re-discharged as a twentieth commemoration box set version with postcards the next year. The spread plan was again by Storm Thorgerson, the architect of the first 1973 spread. On certain pressings, a faintly perceptible instrumental rendition of the Beatles' "Ticket to Ride" can be heard after "Shroud" over the collection's end pulses. 

The first quadraphonic blend, made by Alan Parsons, was charged by EMI yet never embraced by Pink Floyd, as Parsons was frustrated with his blend. To praise the collection's 30th commemoration, a refreshed encompass variant was discharged in 2003. The band chose not to utilize Parsons' quadraphonic blend (done soon after the first discharge), and rather had designer James Guthrie make another 5.1Â channel encompass sound blend on the SACD position. Guthrie had worked with Pink Floyd since co-creating and designing their eleventh collection, "The Wall", and had recently taken a shot at encompass variants of "The Wall" for DVD-Video and Waters' "In the Flesh" for SACD. Talking in 2003, Alan Parsons communicated some failure with Guthrie's SACD blend, recommending that Guthrie was "potentially excessively consistent with the first blend", however was commonly complimentary. The 30th-commemoration release won four Surround Music Awards in 2003, and has since sold more than 800,000Â copies. The spread picture was made by a group of creators including Storm Thorgerson. The picture is a photo of a uniquely crafted recolored glass window, worked to coordinate the definite measurements and extents of the first crystal structure. Straightforward glass, held set up by pieces of lead, was utilized instead of the misty shades of the first. The thought is gotten from the "feeling of immaculateness in the sound quality, being 5.1 encompass soundÂ ..." The picture was made out of a longing to be "the equivalent yet extraordinary, with the end goal that the plan was obviously DSotM, still the conspicuous crystal configuration, however was unique and thus new". 

"The Dark Side of the Moon" was additionally re-discharged in 2003 on 180-gram virgin vinyl (aced by Kevin Gray at AcousTech Mastering) and included somewhat extraordinary adaptations of the first publications and stickers that accompanied the first vinyl discharge, alongside another 30th commemoration notice. In 2007 the collection was incorporated into "Gracious, coincidentally", a crate set commending the 40th commemoration of Pink Floyd, and a without drm rendition was discharged on the iTunes Store. In 2011 the collection was re-discharged as a component of the Why Pink Floyd...? crusade, including a remastered adaptation of the collection alongside different other material. 

The accomplishment of the collection conveyed riches to each of the four individuals from the band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters purchased huge nation houses, and Nick Mason turned into an authority of upmarket autos. A portion of the benefits were put resources into the generation of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". Architect Alan Parsons got a Grammy Award assignment for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for "The Dark Side of the Moon", and he proceeded to have an effective vocation as a chronicle craftsman with the Alan Parsons Project. Despite the fact that Waters and Gilmour have now and again made light of his commitment to the achievement of the collection, Mason has applauded his job. In 2003, Parsons reflected: "I think they all felt that I figured out how to drape the remainder of my profession on "Clouded Side of the Moon", which has a component of truth to it. In any case, despite everything I wake up once in a while, baffled about the way that they made untold millions and a ton of the general population associated with the record didn't." 

Some portion of the inheritance of "The Dark Side of the Moon" is in its effect on present day music, the artists who have performed spread renditions of its tunes, and even in current urban fantasies. Its discharge is regularly observed as a urgent point in the historical backdrop of shake music, and correlations are here and there drawn between Pink Floyd and Radiohead â explicitly their 1997 collection "alright Computer" â which has been classified "The Dark Side of the Moon" of the 1990s, attributable to the way that the two collections share topics identifying with the passing of an imaginative person's capacity to work in the cutting edge world. 

In a 2018 book about exemplary shake, Steven Hyden finished up, in his youngsters, that "The Dark Side of the Moon" and "Drove Zeppelin IV" were the two biggest collections of the class, vision missions "encompass[ing] the twin posts of adolescent want". They had likenesses, in that both collection's spread and interior work of art shun photos of the groups for "uncertain iconography with no substantial significance (which dependably appeared to give the music bundled inside "increasingly" which means)".
