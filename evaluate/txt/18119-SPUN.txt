The Liverpool away strip has as a general rule been all yellow or white shirts and dark shorts, yet there have been a few exemptions. An all dim unit was presented in 1987, which was utilized until the 1991â 92 centennial season, when it was supplanted by a blend of green shirts and white shorts. After different shading mixes during the 1990s, including gold and naval force, brilliant yellow, dark and dim, and ecru, the club shifted back and forth among yellow and white away units until the 2008â 09 season, when it re-presented the dim pack.

Anfield was worked in 1884 ashore adjoining Stanley Park. It was initially utilized by Everton before the club moved to Goodison Park after an argument about lease with Anfield proprietor John Houlding.

The discoveries of the "Taylor Report" encouraged the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was remade in 1992, concurring with the century of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand. An additional level was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further expanded the limit of the ground however offered ascend to issues when it was opened.

The arena was planned to open in August 2011 and would hold 60,000 observers, with HKS, Inc. contracted to manufacture the arena. Development was ended in August 2008, as Gillett and Hicks experienced issues in financing the Â£300Â million required for the improvement. In October 2012, BBC Sport revealed that Fenway Sports Group, the new proprietors of Liverpool FC, had chosen to redevelop their present home at Anfield arena, instead of structure another arena in Stanley Park. As a major aspect of the redevelopment the limit of Anfield was to increment from 45,276 to roughly 60,000 and would cost around Â£150m. At the point when development was finished on the new Main stand the limit of Anfield was expanded to 54,074. This Â£100Â million development added a third level to the stand.

Liverpool fans frequently allude to themselves as Kopites, a reference to the fans who once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield. In 2008 a gathering of fans chose to frame a fragment club, A.F.C. Liverpool, to play matches for fans who had been estimated out of watching Premier League football. 

The melody "You'll Never Walk Alone", initially from the Rodgers and Hammerstein melodic "Merry go round" and later recorded by Liverpool artists Gerry and the Pacemakers, is the club's song of praise and has been sung by the Anfield swarm since the mid 1960s.

The club's supporters have been engaged with two arena calamities. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium catastrophe, in which 39 Juventus supporters were executed. They were kept to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged toward them; the heaviness of the cornered fans made a divider breakdown. UEFA laid the fault for the episode exclusively on the Liverpool supporters, and restricted every single English club from European challenge for a long time.
