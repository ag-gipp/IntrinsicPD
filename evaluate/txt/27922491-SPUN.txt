Somerset County Cricket Club contended in four residential rivalries amid the 2009 English cricket season: the principal division of the County Championship, the Friends Provident Trophy, the primary division of the NatWest Pro40 League and the Twenty20 Cup. Through their execution in the Twenty20 Cup, the group met all requirements for the Champions League Twenty20. They delighted in an effective season, yet missed the mark regarding winning any rivalries, provoking Director of Cricket Brian Rose to state "We've had enough of being cricket's about men." 

Predictable exhibitions in the County Championship helped Somerset remain challengers for the challenge until the most recent couple of long stretches of the period, yet the batting-accommodating pitch at their home ground, the County Ground, Taunton, implied that the province completed with such a large number of attracts to guarantee their first Championship title. Consistency was additionally key for Somerset's achievement in one-day cricket, where they stayed unbeaten in the gathering phase of the Friends Provident Trophy, however were wiped out in the main thump out round, and wrapped sprinters up by one point in the NatWest Pro40. In the Twenty20 Cup, Somerset completed as losing finalists. This implied they fit the bill for the Champions League Twenty20, where they advanced into the second gathering phase of the challenge. They neglected to win any matches in that period of the challenge, bringing about their disposal. 

Somerset were captained for the third progressive season by their Australian abroad player, Justin Langer, who reported amid the season that it would be his last with Somerset. Marcus Trescothick topped the national batting tables, scoring very nearly 3,000 keeps running in all rivalries in 2009; accordingly, he was named as both Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) Player of the Year and the PCA's Most Valuable Player of the Year. 

After advancement from the second division of the County Championship in 2007, Somerset were among the primary division title contenders in the 2008. A misfortune to Lancashire in the last match of the period implied they completed in fourth spot. David Foot, writing in "Wisden", asserted that such a large number of the Somerset batsmen had "lost their way" in one-day cricket, as they barely stayed away from assignment in the NatWest Pro40, and were wiped out in the Friends Provident Trophy. 

Somerset advanced four players from their institute for the 2009 season, offering contracts to Jos Buttler, Adam Dibble, Chris Jones and James Burke. Of these, just Buttler showed up in the primary group amid the season. They additionally marked David Stiff, a quick bowler topped at Under-19 level for England, on a two-month contract toward the start of the period, which was later stretched out to the finish of the period. Ian Blackwell, commander of the side in 2005 and 2006, left for Durham after mentor Andy Hurry and skipper Justin Langer clarified that they viewed wellness as a need. John Francis and Keith Parsons both resigned toward the finish of 2008, Francis refered to absence of first-group open doors for his takeoff, while at 35 years old, Parsons proclaimed that: "There comes when your body discloses to you it's an ideal opportunity to pack in pro game." 

In his review of the 2009 season for ESPNcricinfo, Andrew McGlashan recognized Somerset's opening organizations with bat and ball as their principle qualities, however anticipated that the center request would battle to have an effect in the County Championship, expressing that "none [of the center order] bounce out as potential match-victors in four-day cricket." He theorized that the group's most obvious opportunity with regards to progress would come in the one-day rivalries. "The Daily Telegraph" gave a progressively uplifting viewpoint, guaranteeing that the district had "enough profundity in batting and crease bowling to challenge [for the County Championship] once more." They recognized turn bowling as a territory of shortcoming following the flight of Blackwell. Sway Willis, writing in "The Guardian", shared this view, and anticipated that Somerset would likewise be blocked by the trouble of getting 20 wickets at home, bringing about such a large number of draws. 

The accompanying players showed up for Somerset in top of the line, List An or Twenty20 cricket in 2009. Age given is toward the beginning of Somerset's first match of the period (15 April 2009). 

In spite of the fact that Marcus Trescothick had a season which David Foot depicted as "imperiously guaranteed", Somerset neglected to win enough matches to represent a genuine test in the 2009 County Championship. The level pitch at the County Ground, Taunton did not support their endeavors; the unevenness for the batsmen implied that everything except one match at the ground was drawn. Sussexs aggregate of 742/5 pronounced was the fifteenth most elevated aggregate in the historical backdrop of the County Championship, while Murray Goodwins innings of 344 not out in that coordinate was the 6th most astounding score by a batsman ever of rivalry. Altogether, six of Somerset's eight home matches contained scores of 500 or over in a solitary innings. Conversely, 500 was come to in just a single of their away matches, by Hampshire at The Rose Bowl. The home conditions helped three of Somerset's batsmen pass 1,000 top notch keeps running in the season, including Craig Kieswetter and Arul Suppiah, who were both granted their area tops subsequent to passing the milestone. Trescothick's 1,817 runs were the most by any batsman in the 2009 challenge, completing more than 200 keeps running in front of the following most productive batsman, and he was named as both PCA Player of the Year and the PCA's Most Valuable Player of the Year for 2009. He was additionally chosen as a major aspect of the group of the year, alongside wicket-manager Kieswetter. 

Rather than the solid batting line-up, Foot recommended that Somerset "came up short on a crease bowler to make up for Andrew Caddicks withdrawal". Caddickâwho made his top notch debut for Somerset in 1991âjust played five matches in 2009, and reported his aim to resign toward the finish of the period. He took ten wickets in 2009, and completed his vocation as Somerset's 6th most astounding wicket-taker ever. This set most of the wicket-taking weight upon Charl Willoughby, the South African quick medium pace bowler. He reacted well, and took 54 wickets in the County Championship, more than some other bowler in the principal division. He was supported via crease bowlers David Stiff, who came back to the top of the line amusement out of the blue since 2006, and Alfonso Thomas. Solid took 31 wickets, more than quadrupling his vocation top notch wicket aggregate, and Thomas took 35, his most elevated return in an English household season. Somerset did not have a powerful turn bowler in 2009 after the takeoff of Ian Blackwell the past season, and the spinners joined just guaranteed 31 wickets, bowling less balls between them than Willoughby alone. 

Somerset started their season by playing out a high-scoring draw at home against Warwickshire, in which the two groups achieved 500 in their first innings. James Hildreth scored a triple-century, achieving the achievement prior in an English season than any player beforehand, and turned into the principal English player to pass 300 keeps running in an innings for Somerset since Harold Gimblett in 1948. Conversely, Somerset needed to fight back for an attract their second match. After Durham scored 543 in their first innings, Somerset fallen to 69 full scale in answer; just Langer passed 20 runs, while six of his batting associates made ducks. Subsequent to being compelled to pursue on, Trescothick, Langer and Kieswetter all scored a very long time to verify a draw. Somerset's third match brought about their solitary loss of the County Championship season, coming against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge; and toward the finish of May, they were second base in the primary division. Their next match completed in a draw against Lancashire, an outcome which was in every case likely after the primary day was lost to rain. Somerset next got triumphs against Yorkshire and Sussex before scoring the second-most astounding ever fourth innings winning aggregate in the County Championship to beat Yorkshire at Taunton. These three successes moved Somerset to third in the challenge toward the beginning of July, and they didn't dip under this situation for the rest of the period. 

In every one of their following two matches, at home against Hampshire and away to Worcestershire, Somerset batted first and afterward upheld the pursue on in the wake of bowling their adversaries out efficiently. In each their rivals figured out how to keep away from annihilation, and the two matches brought about draws. Amid the Worcestershire coordinate, Langer's first innings 107 took him past Sir Donald Bradman's aggregate of 28,067 top notch rushes to turn into the most astounding scoring Australian batsman. Progressive draws against Nottinghamshire, Warwickshire, Sussex and Hampshire implied that Somerset ventured out to Durham requiring a triumph to keep up any practical any desires for asserting the County Championship title. No play was conceivable on the third and fourth days, and the match brought about another draw, leaving Somerset with just a thin scientific possibility of the title. Another draw, against Lancashire, while Durham beat Nottinghamshire, implied that Durham secured the title. Somerset drew with Worcestershire (their ninth attract a column in the challenge), and completed third in the main division.

In the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy, the first day rivalry in the English residential logbook, Somerset demonstrated a checked improvement from the past season. They were depicted by Steve James, writing in "Wisden", as "the most great qualifiers" from the gathering stage, and both Trescothick and Kieswetter were lauded for their batting structure. They were the main side in the challenge to stay unbeaten in the gathering stages, completing with seven triumphs and one no outcome. In the quarter-last, against Group C sprinters up Sussex, Somerset won the hurl and picked to bat at Taunton. They battled at first, losing the early wickets of Trescothick, James Hildreth and Ben Phillips for only 39 runs. A fourth-wicket organization of 167, ruled by ground-breaking hitting from Kieswetter in which he scored an "eminent century" as per ESPNcricinfo's Andrew McGlashan, helped Somerset to recoup to make 285/8, however Sussex pursued the aggregate down in the last over to kill the home side. 

Amid the gathering phases of their battle, Somerset accomplished various huge triumphs. They won by eight wickets against Warwickshire and Middlesex, and by in excess of a hundred keeps running against Kent and Scotland. Their match against Middlesex at Lord's was defaced by some contention, after Somerset were permitted an excessive number of powerplay overs in the downpour influenced installation. 

Somerset were set a decreased focus of 290 off 41 overs, of which 19 were apportioned by the umpires as being powerplay overs, three more than there ought to have been. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) rejected Middlesex's solicitation to replay the match, expressing that they were maintaining "the point of reference that umpire mistakes can't frame the premise to pronounce a match invalid and void". 

The two matches played against Middlesex were as a conspicuous difference; in the match played at the Recreation Ground, Bath, Somerset bowled the London side out for 65, the joint second-most minimal all out made against Somerset in a List A match, while the 341/7 which Middlesex made at Lord's was the fourth-most elevated absolute scored against Somerset in the arrangement. Somerset themselves scored their second-most noteworthy List An aggregate, storing up 403/3 against Scotland, a diversion in which Hildreth scored 151, his most astounding List A score, and Somerset's most elevated score by a batsman at number three in List A cricket.

Somerset completed as sprinters up to Sussex in the 2009 Twenty20 Cup, having achieved Finals Day in what skipper Justin Langer portrayed as "strange" design. Somerset fit the bill for the thump out phases of the challenge as the best third-put group amid the gathering stage, at that point beat Lancashire in a bowl-out to meet all requirements for the semi-finals. Subsequent to defeating Kent in the semi-last, Somerset were exhaustively beaten by Sussex in the last. 

After the Indian Premier League's second season exhibited the significance of turn bowling in Twenty20 cricket, and because of Somerset's absence of a forefront turn bowler, Somerset picked youthful leg spinner Max Waller to make his Twenty20 introduction in their opening match of the battle. He guaranteed three wickets in two overs to enable Somerset to win by one run, and completed the challenge as Somerset's joint second-most elevated wicket-taker with 10 wickets. Regardless of various great exhibitions by Somerset's bowlers, a batsman was named man of the match in every one of the group's triumphs: James Hildreth, Craig Kieswetter and Marcus Trescothick were altogether granted the honor once, while Zander de Bruyn got the honor on three events. Somerset finished the gathering stage with six successes, three misfortunes and one no outcome, putting them third in the Midlands/Wales/West Division. They met all requirements for the knockout-arrange as they were the best third-set group in the three gatherings. 

Somerset's quarter-last, against Lancashire, was planned for Tuesday 28 July 2009. Terrible climate implied that no play was conceivable on either the Tuesday or Wednesday, because of which the groups mentioned uncommon administration from the ECB for an extra hold day on the Thursday, which was allowed. The wet climate kept, constraining the groups to play a bowl-out. Each group needed to choose five bowlers, every one of whom had two conveyances at a lot of unguarded stumps. Somerset won the bowl-out 5â 1, with Ben Phillips, Peter Trego and Willoughby each hitting the stumps once, and Thomas hitting them twice. 

In the second semi-last of 2009 Finals Day, Somerset won the hurl and chose to field against Kent. Affordable bowling from Thomas and Willoughby, just as the early wickets of Joe Denly and Martin van Jaarsveld, constrained Kent to 145/5. On a moderate pitch, Trescothick played what ESPNcricinfo's Andrew McGlashan portrayed as a "severe innings", scoring 56 keeps running off 32 balls. He shared an opening association of 73 with chief Langer, and when of Trescothick's rejection after 8.1 overs, Somerset required 62 keeps running off 71 balls.

A solid batting show by Sussex, featured by Dwayne Smith's 59 keeps running off 26 balls, set Somerset an objective of 173 to win. In the opening overs of Somerset's answer, Trescothick scored intensely, making the pursuit "look basic" as indicated by McGlashan. Be that as it may, after he was gotten on 33, Somerset lost ordinary wickets. An association of 41 between de Bruyn and Trego steadied Somerset for a period, yet when the pair were rejected in ensuing overs, their group fallen from 104/4 to 109 full scale. 

Toward the beginning of the challenge, Somerset played with forceful batting strategies, opening the innings with Kieswetter and Trescothick for the initial six matches. This opening pair just passed 20 runs together on one event, against Glamorgan, and for the remainder of the competition, Kieswetter dropped down the batting request and Langer joined Trescothick at the highest point of the innings, in a move that Kieswetter said "adds a touch of equalization to the side by putting more capability down the end and experience up top". The more experienced pair passed 40 runs together on four out of five events. The region's bowling depended intensely on medium pace, a reality which cricket author Scyld Berry proposed was uncovered in the last.

Somerset's first match of the 2009 NatWest Pro40, against Nottinghamshire, finished only one over shy of the prerequisite for a match. Pursuing 248 to win, Somerset were essentially behind the required rate when downpour ended play in the ninth over. The side reacted emphatically to this stroke of karma, winning their next three matches by huge edges, before losing to Essex. Having been placed in to bat at Taunton, every one of Somerset's main six batsman achieved twofold figures, yet none of them figured out how to pass 50 and the home side were in the end hard and fast for 205. In spite of taking early wickets amid Essex's inningsâat one phase having the guests 12/3âthe batting of John Maunders, James Foster and Tim Phillips impelled Essex past Somerset's aggregate with five balls remaining. Two further triumphs guaranteed that Somerset entered their last match of the period with an opportunity to win the title. 

Somerset had performed well yet passed up a great opportunity barely in both the other one-day rivalries in 2009, and could have secured the challenge with triumph in their last match. News sifted through to the County Ground amid their last match, against Durham, that pioneers Sussex had lost to Worcestershire, implying that a success against the north-eastern group would ensure Somerset the title. The outcome once in a while looked likely; a quick opening to the pursuit by Durham openers Phil Mustard and Ian Blackwell gave a stage to their group to guarantee triumph, and deny Somerset the title. Three of Somerset's bowlers asserted at least ten wickets in the challenge (Ben Phillips, 14; Alfonso Thomas, 13; Charl Willoughby, 11), more than some other area in Division One.

Media consideration encompassed Trescothick, who had returned home ahead of schedule from his last abroad visit in 2006â 07 with a "stress-related sickness". Brian Rose focused on that there was no weight on Trescothick to participate in the competition, and that the area would do everything conceivable to help him. The previous England batsman took part in the competition, arriving three days after the remainder of the squad. He played in both of Somerset's matches in the gathering phase of the challenge, however he just figured out how to score 17 keeps running between his two innings.

Wes Durston, who supplanted Trescothick in the side, top-scored for Somerset in their next match, making 57. Just two different players achieved twofold figures for the area, and the Diamond Eagles pursued down the aggregate with eight balls to save. Somerset went into their last match, against the New South Wales Blues with a thin numerical shot of advancing, yet a solid bowling show from Brett Lee and Stuart Clark limited Somerset to 111, which the Australian side came to easily.
