History of the British farthing 

The British farthing (got from the Anglo-Saxon "feorthing", a "fourthling" or "fourth part") was a British coin worth a fourth of an old penny ( of a pound sterling). It stopped to be struck after 1956 and was demonetised from 1 January 1961. 

The British farthing is a continuation of the English farthing, struck by English rulers before the Act of Union 1707, which brought together the crowns of England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain. Just example farthings were struck under Queen Anne as there was an excess of farthings from past rules. The coin was struck irregularly under George I and George II, however by the rule of George III, fakes were so common the Royal Mint stopped striking copper coinage after 1775. The following farthings were the primary struck by steam control, in 1799 by Matthew Boulton at his Soho Mint under permit. Boulton authored more in 1806, and the Royal Mint continued generation in 1821. The farthing was struck decently routinely under George IV and William IV. By then it conveyed a downsized adaptation of the penny's structure, and would keep on reflecting the penny and halfpenny until after 1936. 

Farthings were struck in many long stretches of Queen Victoria's long rule. The coin kept on being issued in many long periods of the primary portion of the twentieth century, and in 1937 it at long last gotten its own turn around structure, a wren. When the coin bore the picture of Elizabeth II in 1953â 1956, expansion had disintegrated its esteem. A fall in business request additionally added to its death. 

The British farthing is a continuation of the farthing arrangement started in silver under the English ruler Henry III in the thirteenth century and first struck in copper in the mid seventeenth century under James I of England. Britannia first showed up on the coin in 1672, under Charles II. Issuance of farthings had not been important amid a large portion of the rule of Queen Anne (1701â 1714) because of an overflow of English farthings, which proceeded available for use. Be that as it may, starting in 1713, there was a lack of copper coin (the halfpenny and farthing). The Royal Mint intended to issue farthings in 1714, however this was upset by the demise of the Queen that year. The 1714 farthing, weighing 4.8â 5.8Â grams and of 21â 22 millimeters distance across, is esteemed an example. It contained about a farthing of copper, as Sir Isaac Newton was Master of the Mint, and he trusted coins ought to contain their incentive in metal. Some Anne farthings got away into dissemination, and there was a tenacious and off base legend that they were of massively high esteem. Britannia is said to shoulder the similarity of Queen Anne, and as indicated by the numismatic essayist Kerry Rodgers, "it was now that the mixing of the female embodiment of Britain with the picture of the supreme Queen takes firm hold." Newton had solid perspectives about the nature of the coinage, and the Anne farthing shows progresses, for example, more prominent consistency in striking, over that of William III. 

The requirement for a copper coinage was no less after the promotion of King George I (1714â 1727), however the Anne halfpennies and farthings (made with metal arranged at the Royal Mint) had fizzled tests for virtue, and it was not until 1717 that Newton attempted to coin those two groups once more, this time from copper strip bought from a contractual worker. The cost of metal had risen, so the new farthings were lighter than the Anne coins, at 4.5â 5.3Â grams. The farthings struck in 1717 were littler and thicker than the 1714 coins, with a breadth of 20â 21 millimeters, and they are known as "dump" farthings. Farthings of 1719â 1724 are marginally bigger, at 22â 23 millimeters, yet are of a similar weight. The coins were in high help, and the Royal Mint experienced difficulty exchanging the structure to the spaces, bringing about bunch defects. The coin includes the right-confronting head of King George and the engraving on the front, and for the switch a plan indistinguishable to that of the Anne farthings: Britannia with the engraving and the date in the exergue beneath. Farthings were available to be purchased at the Mint's premises at the Tower of London in bundles of five and ten shillings; the Treasury would not allot assets for common circulation. The farthing's plans were by John Croker, conceivably helped by Johann Rudolph Ochs Sr, and were struck in consistently from 1717â 1724. The Mint had contracted for strip for a long time; when the agreement finished, the coinage ceased. 

George I kicked the bucket in 1727, a similar year as Newton, and the lord's child King George II prevailing to the position of authority, ruling until 1760. Croker engraved the new King's head for the coinage; the Britannia configuration was not changed. Farthings with Croker's plan for George's head were printed in 1730â 1737 and 1739. A bust appearing more seasoned King by John Sigismund Tanner was utilized on the farthing in 1741, 1744, 1746, 1749, 1750, and 1754, however the 1754 coin was likely stamped in any event until 1763. All George II farthings weighed 4.5â 5.3Â grams and had a width of 22â 23 millimeters. The two front-sides indicated left-confronting heads of King George and the engraving , and on the invert, Britannia with the engraving and the date in the exergue. The farthing was made in moderately modest number contrasted with the halfpenny (struck each year from 1730â 1754); in no year were even half the same number of farthings instituted, and in many years, far less. 

The 1754 stoppage was because of an excess of coppers, and was done at the pressing solicitation of dealers. And still, at the end of the day, an alternate issueâfalsifyingâhad developed. Lightweight fake halfpennies and farthings (the penny was then made of silver) had been viewed as ahead of schedule as 1725, and in the next decades, they turned into a flood. The laws at the time made forging copper coin only a crime, deserving of a fine or a present moment in gaol, while duplicating of gold and silver was managed harshly. The fakes were particularly predominant in provincial regions where majestic issues, with no composed arrangement of appropriation, were once in a while observed. No farthings were instituted after 1754, except for 1754-dated later issues which may have been because of the Royal Mint spending loads of copper. To make the falsifying uneconomical, in 1755 the Mint Board proposed decreasing the estimation of the farthing to pence and the halfpenny to , yet the Government can't. 

The principal halfpennies and farthings with the head of George II's grandson and successor, King George III (1760â 1820), were issued in 1771, the year Parliament made it a crime to fake copper coin. This had little impact; extensive amounts were dissolved down for lightweight impersonations, however the farthing was less duplicated than the halfpenny. This first arrangement of George III farthings, struck in 1771 and 1773â 1775, had a weight of 4.3â 5.3Â grams, with measurement 23â 24 millimeters. The front, planned by Richard Yeo or Thomas Pingo portrays a right-confronting bust of the lord, with the engraving , while no noteworthy change was made to the switch. Regardless of the duplicating, the Mint stopped striking coppers in 1775 on the ground that there were adequate legitimate farthings and halfpennies in business. The farthing would not be struck again by the Royal Mint until 1821. 

From 1775, most copper coins available for use were fake. The private area in the long run responded, filling the hole with private tokens beginning in 1787, and the Treasury granted an agreement to Matthew Boulton to strike copper coins in 1797. At his Soho Mint close Birmingham, Boulton created the outstanding Cartwheel pennies and twopences, so named for their appearance, the main authority British coins struck by steam. The agreement did exclude delivering farthings, however Boulton arranged a few examples. In 1799, Boulton was given a permit to create halfpennies and farthings. Meanwhile the cost of copper had risen, and an increasingly ordinary coin was struck. 

The 1799 farthing broke new ground in two regions: the switch was recorded , the first run through the name of a division had ever showed up on an English or British coin, and it was likewise the main British coin to have the date on a similar side as the ruler's head. The engraving on the front progressed toward becoming , and the turn around portrays an overhauled left-confronting situated Britannia holding a shower and lance, with the engraving . In 1806â 1807 a further 22.5 huge amounts of copper was struck into farthings by Boulton, yet the cost of copper had risen again and the weight was not exactly the 1799 issue. Farthings of the 1799 issue weigh 5.8â 6.6Â grams, with a distance across 23â 24 millimeters, while the later Boulton issue weighs 4.7â 4.8Â grams with a width 21â 22 millimeters. For the 1806â 1807 issues, the group was expelled from the coin, was contracted as , and the picture of Britannia was marginally adjusted. Copper farthings and halfpennies from before 1797 were brought in by decree dated 5 December 1817, and were recovered by weight. 

The money was improved during the 1810s with the Great Recoinage of 1816. The creation of copper coins did not continue until after George III's demise in 1820 and the increase of King George IV (1820â 1830). Farthings were created in 1821, Britannia keeping up her place on the invert. These pieces were made current by a decree of 14 November of that year, that made them lawful delicate to sixpence. The first coinage representation of the King, by Benedetto Pistrucci, pulled in solid regal abhorrence, yet was utilized on the farthing in 1821 and in 1823â 26. By at that point, Pistrucci had been banished from work on the coinage for declining to duplicate crafted by another craftsman. William Wyon was given the errand of etching what turned into the additionally complimenting "uncovered head" sort of 1826. The issue of coppers in 1826 was a direct result of the withdrawal of isolated issues for Ireland; the Irish penny had been esteemed at of its British proportionate. The invert was updated somewhat, yet stayed pretty much the equivalent. The Pistrucci-structured farthings weighed 4.5â 4.8Â grams, with a measurement of 22 millimeters; the later ones by Wyon (issued every year from 1826â 1830) weighed 4.6â 4.9Â grams with a distance across of 22 millimeters. Both Pistrucci's and Wyon's plans were delivered in 1826. The Pistrucci front demonstrates a left-confronting bust of King George IV with the engraving , while the invert demonstrates a right-confronting helmeted Britannia situated to one side of the coin, holding a shield and trident, with the engraving and the date in the exergue under Britannia. The Wyon front demonstrates a laureate bust of King George IV, confronting left, with the engraving , while the switch engraving is unaltered. 

The demise of King George in 1830 brought his sibling, King William IV (1830â 1837) to the position of royalty. Wyon, by then Chief Engraver, left the turn around of the farthing unaltered, and for the front engraved a picture of King William by Sir Francis Chantrey. The engravings were unaltered, then again, actually (William IV) was substituted for on the front. The farthing was created in 1831, and 1834â 1837, the last issue being struck amid the time of King William's passing. 

Farthings bearing the representation of Queen Victoria, by Wyon, were struck start in 1838; no change was made to the turn around other than substituting the shortened form (Regina, or Queen) for (King), showing there was presently a supreme Queen. The farthing continued as before size it had been since 1826. From 1838, the farthing was struck each time of Victoria's long rule aside from 1870, 1871 and 1889 (the 1877 issue was just in verification and may have been made sometime in the not too distant future). A similar front-side bites the dust were utilized for the copper farthing and the sovereign and undoubtedly were utilized for the gold coin first. This added to an abnormal state of imperfections in the farthing arrangement, however guaranteed that they were struck each year, similar to the prevalent gold coin. In Victorian occasions, a farthing could purchase three clams, with meat and potatoes, from a shellfish dealer strolling the roads of London. The coin would be sufficient to buy a sparrow at a market in London's East End. 

In 1859, the Government chose the poor condition of the copper coinage requested its withdrawal. Bronze was esteemed an appropriate substitution. Parliament passed enactment in 1860 that permitted the penny, halfpenny and farthing to be struck from an amalgam of metals. Expansive amount of bronze pennies, halfpennies and farthings were struck start in 1860 by the Royal Mint as well as by two Birmingham firms under contract. Despite the fact that the heaviness of the penny was divided, the farthing was helped by somewhat not as much as that in case it be excessively little. The farthing was practically indistinguishable to the penny and halfpenny however for minor subtleties. The new bronze coinage went into flow in December 1860; the old copper pieces were demonetised after 31 December 1869 in Britain (however the Mint would even now acknowledge them until 1873) and toward the finish of 1877 for the provinces. 

The new bronze farthings weighed 2.8â 3.0Â grams, were 20 millimeters in measurement, and were made of a composite of 95% copper, 4% tin and 1% zinc. Slighting minor changes in combination, these would remain the farthing's particulars until abrogation after 1956. They read on the switch, with the date in the exergue underneath Britannia. The front highlights the "Bun head" or "Youthful head" of Victoria; the two sides of the coin were structured by Leonard Charles Wyon, William's child. The engraving on the front-side was . A "H" mintmark underneath the date can be seen on some 1874â 1876 and 1881â 1882 farthings; they were struck at the Heaton Mint in Birmingham. Despite the fact that the Bun farthing arrangement delivered a few assortments, they are not as broad with respect to the penny and halfpenny. The farthing would in general have the least mintages of the three bronze coins, somewhere in the range of 1 and 6 million being struck in many years in the late Victorian time; a bigger number of halfpennies were struck than farthings, and mintages of the penny were routinely surpassing 10 million by the 1890s. Albeit less farthings were struck, a bigger rate has made due because of the nostalgic connection of the British individuals to the coin most reduced in group. 

In 1896, another front-side was acquainted with the bronze coinage appearing as an old lady. The front-side was planned by Thomas Brock and engraved by George William de Saulles. The farthing kept on showing it until the time of the Queen's passing, 1901. De Saulles additionally reconsidered the switch; the most noteworthy change was the cancellation of the beacon and ship on either side of Britannia; they could stay away for the indefinite future to the farthing. The engraving on the Old Head farthing was . Starting in 1897, farthings were issued misleadingly obscured; this was to keep away from perplexity of brilliant new farthings with the half sovereign; the bronze farthing and the gold piece were a similar size. 

The farthing of King Edward VII (1901â 1910), Victoria's child and successor, was struck in consistently from 1902â 1910; it was still falsely obscured. Mintages extended from 2.6 million (1910) to 8.9 million (1908) when the penny's mintage never dipped under 12 million and rose to 47 million of every 1907. A sum of Â£1,021,013 in pennies were struck bearing Edward's picture, and Â£222,790 in halfpennies, however just Â£45,429 in farthings. Be that as it may, for the announcement of the coin's esteem, the plans on the penny, halfpenny and farthing are adequately indistinguishable as De Saulles utilized a Janvier diminishing machine to change over models to kicks the bucket. The new front was his work, demonstrating the lord's correct confronting bust, with the engraving . 

The farthings of Edward's child and successor, King George V, brought about another left-confronting picture by Sir Bertram Mackennal and the continuation of the Britannia plan. Farthings bearing King George's picture were delivered each time of his rule yet 1910 and 1936. Other than substituting (George V) for , no change was made to the engraving. In 1917, the Mint stopped to obscure farthings as the half sovereign was never again being stamped. In a similar manner as the penny and halfpenny, the King's head was made somewhat littler in 1926. The delineation of Britannia was likewise marginally balanced in that year. An aggregate of Â£5,710,748 in pennies, Â£1,039,704 in halfpennies and Â£222,643 in farthings were struck for the rule. 

The Edward VIII farthing is an example which was anticipating illustrious endorsement at the season of the renouncement in December 1936. There was a development in progress for increasingly present day coinage structures; the Irish Free State had in 1927 embraced a progression of coins delineating creatures and a portion of the provinces had overhauled their coinages. Lord Edward was additionally intrigued by a move far from the heraldry that checked British coinage, indicating outside coins on his watch chain to the Deputy Master of the Mint, Robert Johnson, and requesting progressively like those. Ruler Edward inevitably gave in on the inquiry, expecting that such plans would be inadmissible to the British individuals, yet non-heraldic topics for the halfpenny (a cruising boat) and farthing endure. The chose structure for the farthing, a wren, set the littlest British fledgling on the British coin littlest in esteem. While trying to break the stop among King and Mint, craftsman Wilson Parker had arranged a progression of coinage structures dependent on what were inexactly esteemed regal creatures: bird, dove, stag, sturgeon, swan and wren, which however loved by the Advisory Committee (counting a youthful Kenneth Clark) did not get their underwriting because of their inclination for heraldry. Another explanation behind the change was that the Britannia configuration, diminished from a model, was hard to acknowledge given the coin's little size. The front was planned by Humphrey Paget. Lord Edward got his way on one issue; his representation confronted left on the examples, though by convention a ruler faces the other way from the last rule, and George V had confronted left. Edward demanded as he thought about his left profile his better side. The main change to the engraving was the substitution of (Edward VIII) for . 

The wren configuration was endorsed for the coinage of Edward's sibling and successor, King George VI (1936â 1952); it would remain on the coin for its staying twenty years. Paget updated his front-side to incorporate the new ruler's left-confronting bust, and the wording was changed in accordance with incorporate . The coin was struck every year from 1937. In 1949, after the freedom of India, was expelled from the front-side. The promotion of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 conveyed another representation to the farthing the next year, structured by Mary Gillick. The front-side engraving was in 1953, and from that point. This change was an acknowledgment that a portion of the countries of the British Commonwealth were republics. 

In the years after the Second World War, the farthing had seen more use, as the standard one-pound (454 g) bread portion had its value set by government, and the cost incorporated an odd halfpenny; hence a money exchange for the buy of a half-pound portion without anyone else's input required a farthing, either with the installment or change. By the 1950s, because of swelling, the obtaining intensity of the farthing had dropped, as had business request. Letters to "The Times" mirrored this reality: one reporter detailed being declined when offering eight farthings to a transport conductor for a twopenny admission, and a seller getting to be harsh when offered six farthings for a paper. This happened despite the fact that, as a later letter noticed, the coin was as yet lawful delicate to a peddling. Request kept on lessening, and creation of the farthing was suspended after 1956. Dispensing with the farthing from trade additionally cleared path for a conceivable littler penny and halfpenny that Royal Mint authorities mulled over proposing.. The farthing stopped to be lawful delicate after 31 December 1960.
