The collection is planned as a soundtrack to the "Prisons and Dragons" pretending diversion and was created by Midnight Syndicate in line with Wizards of the Coast, the organization that possesses the rights to the "Cells and Dragons" establishment. Midnight Syndicate was drawn closer by amusement planners at a gaming tradition where they had set up slow down, and they consented to create the collection. 

After an underlying gathering with Wizards of the Coast, the two individuals from Midnight SyndicateâEdward Douglas and Gavin Goszkaâwere left to compose and create the collection themselves. They went their different ways and created tracks freely of each other, yet returned together to orchestrate the collection and ace the tracks. The collection was an adjustment in style for Midnight Syndicate, in light of the fact that a large portion of it had a dream feel, though their prior works had been for the most part repulsiveness based. Craftsmanship inside the collection booklet originated from "Prisons and Dragons" sourcebooks, including works from noticeable amusement originators, for example, Skip Williams. The collection was generally welcomed by Wizards of the Coast, with positive audits from music pundits and the gaming network. It is supposedly the main authority "Prisons and Dragons" soundtrack. 

As indicated by Bob Ignizio of Utter Trash, an ezine including "music, films and the sky is the limit from there", Midnight Syndicate's more established collections had just been utilized as ambient sounds to pretending sessions for a long time. Wizards of the Coast portrayed the band's music as "the ideal backup to pretending amusement sessions". Backing for Midnight Syndicate's music as a pretending help developed so much that the band chose to set up slows down at gaming traditions. At their first tradition, Midnight Syndicate was drawn nearer by Wizards of the Coast, which thusly inquired as to whether they would be keen on chronicle an official soundtrack, to which they concurred. 

Before the band began composing or recording music they sat down with the "Cells and Dragons" fashioners, who educated them of a few components that were basic on the collection. As indicated by Ed Stark, the exceptional task supervisor of Wizards of the Coast, this comprised of "a pursuit scene and a battle scene and things like that". This was new to the band who had never composed music to fit another person's thoughts previously. Obvious stated, be that as it may, that "they truly got that. We were inspired, on the grounds that we're in kind of a specialty industry, and we're not constantly used to individuals getting precisely what we need immediately". After this, the band was for the most part left to manage the music themselves. The planners were at that point acquainted with Midnight Syndicate's music and recognized what's in store from the collection. As motivation for prior collections had now and then originated from "Cells and Dragons" gaming sessions, Douglas said that composition the collection came all around normally. 

After the underlying gathering with diversion architects, the collection was written similarly Midnight Syndicate expectedly compose. To start with, Douglas and Goszka concurred on the setting they were endeavoring to make with the collection and after that filled in insights regarding the setting. When this was done, they dealt with music independently, in their own distinctive studios. They stayed in contact all through the composition procedure to guarantee that their work was firm and fitting for the collection. When composing was finished, they cooperated on orchestrating, acing and blending the tracks. 

Douglas said that, for him, instrument decision fell into place without any issues and that "sounds and here and there even songs fall in line themselves". The band had a wide number of instruments available to them, as all the music is delivered on synthesizers. To guarantee Douglas remained consistent with making the melodic scene he proposed, his studio was secured with "Prisons and Dragons" work of art and module covers all through chronicle. 

Joseph Vargo, the official maker on Midnight Syndicate's collections "Conceived of the Night" and "Domain of Shadows", has said that he was the person who started the main contact between Wizards of the Coast and the band.

Wizards of the Coast guaranteed that the collection was the primary authority "Cells and Dragons" soundtrack, and this was rehashed by different gatherings, including Metropolis Mail Order, GamingReport.com, and Skirmisher Game Store. It was not, be that as it may, the primary authority "Prisons and Dragons" music. A long time prior, another collection, "First Quest: The Music", was discharged by Filmtrax and authorized by TSR, at that point proprietors of "Cells and Dragons", for "Cutting edge Dungeons and Dragons". The collection was discharged both as a tape and a record and accompanied a pre-printed module. The two organizations demonstrated disliked and are hard to discover today. The music on "First Quest" was keyed explicitly to the module that accompanied it, as opposed to as a soundtrack to the amusement when all is said in done. 

As indicated by Mario Mesquita Borges of AllMusic, Midnight Syndicate commonly make "dimly mixed structures", portrayed both as "melancholy" and "agonizing". Leonard Pickel of "Frequented Attraction Magazine" expressed that "every year, the band's music turns out to be more a piece of America's Halloween culture", and expressed that the band had "truly shaped their very own melodic sort". For Douglas, in any case, "Prisons and Dragons" was an alternate style of music from different collections and soundtracks that the band had delivered. Initially, he had portrayed Midnight Syndicate's music as "Gothic Nightmare Soundtracks", however asserted that "Prisons and Dragons" had a more dream feel than past discharges, which concentrated more on awfulness, implying that he currently depicts the band's music as "Gothic Fantasy Nightmare Soundtracks".

Sounds were additionally examined, including the hints of fight on "Conclusive Confrontation", and spoken words in "Specialty of the Wizard". 

Dwindle Jan Van Damme, the proprietor of the elective music ezine Darker than the Bat, portrayed "Cells and Dragons" as going more toward contemporary traditional writers, for example, Trevor Jones, while as yet holding the frightfulness sound ordinary of Midnight Syndicate. The collection has been ordered into a scope of kinds by commentators, including neoclassical, gothic encompassing, ethereal, and gothic shake. 

Wizards of the Coast were content with the subsequent collection, with Anthony Valterra, the organization's RPG classification chief, saying that Midnight Syndicate "have prevailing at catching the enchantment of "D&D" through music". Various pundits got on the possibility that new topic had brought about another vibe for the music, with analysts guaranteeing that the dream impact had given the collection an alternate sound to Midnight Syndicate's gothic ghastliness soundtracks. An anonymous author for the now-old Living Dead Girls ezine said that "Cells and Dragons" "brings a more extensive scope of melodies than Midnight Syndicate produces for their Gothic frightfulness soundtracks", implying that the collection "shows out of the blue the assorted variety and melodic specialty [of which] Midnight Syndicate is proficient".

The collection was scrutinized by Marc Shayed, of the diversion gaming news site GamingReport.com, for concentrating a lot on battle and mood. He clarified that there was just a single track that felt triumphant and no tracks appropriate for voyaging or character "down time", which are measures in dream gaming. Regardless of these apparent holes, he called it "a definitive" gaming soundtrack. The collection was additionally condemned by Gene Vogal of the National Gamers Guild who said that it came up short on a ton of the "oomph" that "Vampyre" had, and thought Wizards about the Coast may have been at fault for it. He thought that the collection's being made unequivocally for "D&D" made it better than music not explicitly created for amusements (e.g., film soundtracks) as a gaming help. He reprimanded the soundtrack for being less unique than "Vampyre", and sounding much like "The Lord of the Rings" soundtracks. 

The collection was composed and delivered by Edward Douglas and Gavin Goszka, the main two individuals from Midnight Syndicate. The collection's graphical structure was executed by Mark Rakocy and Jeff Visgaitis, with "extra plan" credited to "Stan!"

Prior to this point, the depictions had been composed by Douglas or by Vargo, who had likewise been in charge of fine art in some prior collections. Fine art for the collection was taken from "Cells and Dragons" pretending sourcebooks. Douglas said that he was "a colossal devotee of "Prisons and Dragons" fine art, so having free on that material was entertaining". This work of art was applauded by Gene Vogal, who depicted it as "one or more to the conceivable Wizards of the Coast obstruction" and said that the "Disc coat was done all around pleasantly and has some cool fine art all through". The collection contains work of art by the amusement fashioners Todd Lockwood and Skip Williams, just as from the specialists Scott Fischer, Brian Snoddy, Lars Grant-West, Wayne Reynolds, Mark Tedin, and Sam Wood. 

There is a last 36-second reward track, which once in a while gets no title, and now and then is named "Bungle!" The Midnight Syndicate site does not make reference to the track by any means. It is a joke track in which a hapless "D&D" player calls something from the amusement into this present reality. Chris Harvey of "Development Magazine" found the shakers moving audio cues "amusing".
