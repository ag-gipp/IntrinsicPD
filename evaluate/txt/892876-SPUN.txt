War of the League of Cambrai 

The War of the League of Cambrai, once in a while known as the War of the Holy League and by a few different names, was a noteworthy clash in the Italian Wars. The fundamental members of the war, battled from 1508 to 1516, were France, the Papal States and the Republic of Venice; they were joined, at different occasions, by about each critical power in Western Europe, including Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England, the Duchy of Milan, Florence, the Duchy of Ferrara and Swiss soldiers of fortune. 

Pope Julius II, meaning to check Venetian impact in northern Italy, had made the League of Cambrai, an enemy of Venetian coalition comprising of himself, Louis XII of France, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Maximilian I, the Holy Roman Emperor. In spite of the fact that the League was at first fruitful, grinding among Julius and Louis made it breakdown by 1510; Julius then aligned himself with Venice against France. 

The Venetoâ Papal collusion in the end ventured into the Holy League, which drove the French from Italy in 1512; differences about the division of the riches, in any case, drove Venice to desert the union for one with France. Under the administration of Francis I, who had succeeded Louis to the position of royalty, the French and Venetians would, through triumph at Marignano in 1515, recapture the domain they had lost; the bargains of Noyon and Brussels, which finished the war the following year, would basically restore the guide of Italy to the present state of affairs of 1508. 

In the consequence of the First Italian War, Pope Alexander VI had, with French help, moved to solidify Papal command over focal Italy by catching the Romagna. Cesare Borgia, going about as Gonfalonier of the Papal armed forces, had ousted the Bentivoglio family from Bologna, which they had managed as a fief, and was well on his way towards setting up a changeless Borgia state in the district when Alexander kicked the bucket on 18 August 1503. In spite of the fact that Cesare figured out how to catch the leftovers of the Papal treasury for his very own utilization, he was unfit to verify Rome itself, as French and Spanish militaries merged on the city trying to impact the Papal gathering; the decision of Pius III (who soon kicked the bucket, to be supplanted by Julius II) stripped Cesare of his titles and consigned him to directing an organization of men-at-arms. Detecting Cesare's shortcoming, the seized masters of the Romagna offered to submit to the Republic of Venice in return for help in recapturing their domains; the Venetian Senate acknowledged and had claimed Rimini, Faenza and various different urban areas before the finish of 1503. 

Julius II, having verified his very own control of the Papal armed forces by capturing and detaining Cesare, first in Rome and later in Madrid, immediately moved to restore Papal power over the Romagna by requesting that Venice return the urban communities she had seized. The Republic of Venice, albeit willing to recognize Papal power over these port urban communities along the Adriatic coast and willing to pay Julius II a yearly tribute, would not surrender the urban areas themselves. Accordingly, Julius finished up a union with France and the Holy Roman Empire against Venice; the demise of Isabella I of Castile and the subsequent breakdown of relations between the gatherings before long broke up the coalition, however not before Venice had been initiated to desert a few of the urban areas. Julius, albeit unsatisfied with his additions, did not himself have adequate powers to battle the Republic; for the following two years he rather involved himself with the reconquest of Bologna and Perugia, which, situated among Papal and Venetian domain, had meanwhile expected a status of semi freedom. 

In 1507, Julius came back to the topic of the urban areas in Venetian hands; by and by rebuked by the Senate, he urged Emperor Maximilian I to assault the Republic. Maximilian, utilizing his voyage to Rome for the Imperial royal celebration as an affection, entered A venetian area with an expansive armed force in February 1508 and progressed on Vicenza, yet was vanquished by a Venetian armed force under Bartolomeo d'Alviano. A second strike by a Tyrolean power a little while later was a significantly bigger disappointment; Alviano steered the Imperial armed force as well as seized Trieste and Fiume, driving Maximilian to close a ceasefire with Venice. 

Julius, embarrassed by the disappointment of the Imperial attack, swung to Louis XII of France (who, having been left possessing Milan after the Second Italian War, was keen on further venture into Italy) with an idea of collusion. In mid-March, the Republic gave an appearance to an assault on itself by selecting her very own contender to the empty priestly district of Vicenza (a demonstration with regards to winning custom, however Julius thought of it as an individual incitement); the Pope required every single Christian country to go along with him in an endeavor to curb Venice. On 10 December 1508, agents of the Papacy, France, the Holy Roman Empire and Ferdinand I of Spain finished up the League of Cambrai against the Republic. The understanding accommodated the total dismantling of Venice's region in Italy and for its parcel among the signatories: Maximilian, notwithstanding recapturing Istria, would get Verona, Vicenza, Padua and the Friuli; France would attach Brescia, Crema, Bergamo and Cremona to its Milanese belongings; Ferdinand would seize Otranto; and the rest of, Rimini and Ravenna, would be added to the Papal States. 

On 15 April 1509, Louis left Milan at the leader of a French armed force and moved quickly into A venetian area. To restrict him, Venice had contracted a condottiere armed force under the direction of the Orsini cousinsÂ â Bartolomeo d'Alviano and NiccolÃ² di PitiglianoÂ â yet had neglected to represent their difference on how best to stop the French development. Thus, when Louis crossed the Adda River toward the beginning of May and Alviano progressed to meet him, Pitigliano, trusting it best to evade a pitched fight, moved away toward the south. On 14 May, Alviano defied the French at the Battle of Agnadello; dwarfed, he sent solicitations for fortifications to his cousin, who answered with requests to sever the fight and proceeded on his way. Alviano, neglecting the new requests, proceeded with the commitment; his military was in the end encompassed and wrecked. Pitigliano figured out how to abstain from experiencing Louis; yet his soldier of fortune troops, becoming aware of Alviano's annihilation, had betrayed in huge numbers by the following morning, compelling him to withdraw to Treviso with the leftovers of the Venetian armed force. 

The Venetian breakdown was finished. Louis continued to possess A venetian area as far east as Brescia without experiencing any noteworthy opposition; the Venetians lost all the domain that they had amassed in northern Italy amid the earlier century. The real urban areas that had not been involved by the FrenchâPadua, Verona and Vicenzaâwere left undefended by Pitigliano's withdrawal, and immediately surrendered to Maximilian when Imperial emissaries touched base in the Veneto. Julius, having meanwhile issued a forbid against Venice that banished each native of the Republic, attacked the Romagna and caught Ravenna with the help of Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. D'Este, having joined the League and been designated Gonfalonier on 19 April, caught the Polesine for himself. 

The recently arrived Imperial governors, nonetheless, immediately ended up being disagreeable. In mid-July, the natives of Padua, supported by separations of Venetian mounted force under the order of the proveditor Andrea Gritti, revolted. The landsknechts garrisoning the city were excessively very few to mount viable obstruction, and Padua was reestablished to Venetian control on 17 July 1509. The achievement of the revolt at long last pushed Maximilian without hesitation. Toward the beginning of August, a gigantic Imperial armed force, joined by assortments of French and Spanish troops, set out from Trento into the Veneto. On account of an absence of steeds, just as general confusion, Maximilian's powers would not achieve Padua until September, giving Pitigliano an opportunity to think such troops as were as yet accessible to him in the city. The Siege of Padua started on 15 September 1509; albeit French and Imperial mounted guns effectively broken Padua's dividers, the protectors figured out how to hold the city until Maximilian, becoming anxious, lifted the attack on 30 September and pulled back to Tyrol with the fundamental piece of his military. 

In mid-November, Pitigliano came back to the hostile; Venetian troops effectively crushed the staying Imperial powers, catching Vicenza, Este, Feltre and Belluno. In spite of the fact that a consequent assault on Verona fizzled, Pitigliano obliterated a Papal armed force under Francesco II of Gonzaga all the while. The Battle of Polesella, a stream assault on Ferrara by the Venetian cookroom armada under Angelo Trevisan flopped, notwithstanding, when the Venetian boats moored in the Po River were sunk by Ferrarese ordnance. Francesco Guicciardini attributed the conclusive triumph to Alfonso himself. Another French development before long constrained Pitigliano to pull back to Padua indeed. 

Looked with a lack of the two assets and men, the Senate chose to send an international safe haven to Julius so as to arrange a settlement. The terms demanded by the Pope were brutal: the Republic lost her conventional capacity to designate church in her region, just as all purview over Papal subjects in Venice, the Romagnan urban communities that had provoked the war were to be come back to Julius, and reparations were to be paid to cover his costs in catching them. The Senate contended over the terms for two months, however at long last acknowledged them on February 24, 1510. Indeed, even before the Venetian ministers had introduced themselves to Julius for vindication, in any case, the Council of Ten had secretly settled that the terms had been acknowledged under pressure and were in this way invalid, and that Venice ought to disregard them at the most punctual chance. 

This obvious compromise among Venice and the Pope did not prevent the French from again attacking the Veneto in March. Pitigliano's demise in January had left Andrea Gritti in order of the Venetian powers; despite the fact that Maximilian neglected to fortify Louis, the French armed force was regardless adequate to drive the Venetians from Vicenza by May. Gritti garrisoned Padua for a normal assault by a consolidated Franco-Imperial armed force, yet Louis, progressively worried by the passing of his counsel, the Cardinal d'Amboise, deserted his arrangements for an attack. 

Julius, then, had turned out to be progressively worried by the developing French nearness in Italy; more essentially, estranged from Alfonso d'Este by contact over a permit for a salt imposing business model in the Papal states and Alfonso's proceeded attacks against Venetian powers to verify his as of late reacquired Polesine, he had figured designs to catch the Duchy of Ferrara, a French partner, and to add its region to the Papal States. His very own powers being lacking for the endeavor, the Pope contracted a multitude of Swiss hired fighters, requesting them to assault the French in Milan; he likewise welcomed Venice to align with him against Louis. The Republic, confronting a reestablished French surge, promptly acknowledged the offer. 

By July 1510, the new Veneto-Papal coalition was in all out attack mode. An underlying assault on French-involved Genoa bombed, yet Venetian troops under Lucio Malvezzo at long last drove the French from Vicenza toward the beginning of August; and a joint power instructed by Francesco Maria della Rovere, the Duke of Urbino, caught Modena on 17 August. Julius now banished Alfonso d'Este, in this manner legitimizing an assault on the Duchy itself; fully expecting his coming triumph, the Pope made a trip to Bologna, in order to be adjacent when Ferrara was taken. 

The French armed force, be that as it may, had been left unopposed by the Swiss (who, having landed in Lombardy, had been paid off into leaving by Louis) and was allowed to walk south into the core of Italy. Toward the beginning of October, Charles II d'Amboise progressed on Bologna, part the Papal powers; by 18 October, he was just a couple of miles from the city. Julius now understood that the Bolognese were transparently unfriendly to the Papacy and would not offer any protection from the French; left with just a unit of Venetian mounted force, he turned to banishing d'Amboise, who had meanwhile been persuaded by the English represetative to abstain from assaulting the individual of the Pope and had in this way pulled back to Ferrara. 

In December, a recently gathered Papal armed force vanquished Concordia and, in December, blockaded the post of Mirandola; d'Amboise, walking to alleviate the last mentioned, became sick and passed on, quickly leaving the French in disorder. Mirandola fell in January 1511, the pope having assumed moral responsibility for the strike; yet d'Amboise had been supplanted by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, who reclaimed Concordia and Castelfranco, while the Papal armed force withdrew to Casalecchio. Alfonso d'Este, then, stood up to and wrecked the Venetian powers on the Po River, leaving Bologna segregated again. Julius, scared of being caught by the French, left the city for Ravenna. Cardinal Francesco Alidosi, whom he deserted to direction the resistance of the city, was no preferable loved by the Bolognese over Julius himself had been; and when, on 23 May 1511, a French armed force instructed by Trivulzio landed at the doors, they immediately surrendered. Julius accused this thrashing for the Duke of Urbino, who, discovering this very unreasonable, continued to kill Alidosi in full perspective on the Papal gatekeeper. 

By June 1511, a large portion of the Romagna was in French hands; the Papal armed force, disrupted and came up short on, was in no condition to keep Trivulzio from progressing on Ravenna. Because of this fiasco, Julius broadcasted a Holy League against France. The new coalition quickly developed to incorporate not just Spain and the Holy Roman Empire (which surrendered any affectation of clinging to the League of Cambrai with expectations of seizing Navarre from Queen Catherine and Lombardy from Louis), yet in addition Henry VIII of England who, having chosen to blame the event so as to extend his property in northern France, closed the Treaty of Westminsterâa promise of common guide against the Frenchâwith Ferdinand on 17 November 1511. 

In February 1512, Louis designated his nephew, Gaston de Foix, to direction the French powers in Italy. Foix demonstrated more enthusiastic than Amboise had been; having checked the development of RamÃ³n de Cardona's Spanish troops on Bologna, he came back to Lombardy to sack Brescia, which had opposed the French and garrisoned itself with Venetian troops. Mindful that a great part of the French armed force would be redirected to manage the looming English attack, Foix and Alfonso d'Este assaulted Ravenna, the last Papal fortress in the Romagna, with expectations of driving the Holy League into a definitive commitment. Cardona walked to ease the city toward the beginning of April, and was unequivocally beaten in the subsequent Battle of Ravenna, battled on Easter Sunday; the passing of Foix amid the battling, be that as it may, left the French under the order of Jacques de la Palice, who, reluctant to proceed with the crusade without direct requests from Louis, mollified himself with altogether sacking Ravenna. 

By May 1512, the French position had disintegrated significantly. Julius had employed another military of Swiss hired fighters; they slid on Milan, carrying with them Maximilian Sforza, who was resolved to recapture control of the Duchy for his family. The French armies relinquished the Romagna (where the Duke of Urbino immediately caught Bologna and Parma) and withdrew to Lombardy, endeavoring to block the attack. By August, the Swiss had joined with the Venetian armed force and constrained Trivulzio out of Milan, permitting Sforza to be broadcasted Duke with their help; La Palice was then compelled to pull back over the Alps. 

In late August, the individuals from the League met at Mantua to examine the circumstance in Italy (especially the segment of an area obtained from the French). They rapidly went to an understanding with respect to Florence, which had incensed Julius by enabling Louis to gather the Council of Pisa in its region. At the Pope's solicitation, Ramon de Cardona walked into Tuscany, crushed Florentine opposition, ousted the Republic and introduced Giuliano de' Medici as leader of the city. 

Regarding the matter of an area, in any case, crucial differences rapidly emerged. Julius and the Venetians demanded that Maximilian Sforza be allowed to keep the Duchy of Milan; Emperor Maximilian and Ferdinand contrived rather to have one of their cousins introduced as duke. The Pope requested the quick addition of Ferrara to the Papal States; Ferdinand questioned this game plan, wanting the presence of a free Ferrara to counter developing Papal power. Most hazardous, in any case, was the mentality of Maximilian towards Venice. The Emperor wouldn't surrender any Imperial region, which in his eyes included the greater part of the Veneto, to the Republic; to this end, he consented to an arrangement with the Pope to prohibit Venice completely from the last parcel. At the point when the Republic questioned, Julius took steps to change the League of Cambrai against her. Accordingly, Venice swung to Louis; on 23 March 1513, a bargain vowing to separate all of northern Italy among France and the Republic was marked at Blois. 

In late May 1513, a French armed force told by Louis de la TrÃ©moille crossed the Alps and progressed on Milan; in the meantime, Bartolomeo d'Alviano and the Venetian armed force walked west from Padua. The disagreeability of Maximilian Sforza, who was seen by the Milanese as a manikin of his Swiss hired fighters, empowered the French to travel through Lombardy with little opposition; TrÃ©moille, having caught Milan, attacked the staying Swiss in Novara. On 6 June, the French were assaulted by a Swiss help armed force at the Battle of Novara, and were steered regardless of having unrivaled numbers. Separations of the Swiss armed force sought after the escaping French over the Alps and had achieved Dijon before being influenced into pulling back. 

The defeat at Novara initiated a time of ceaseless thrashings for the French union. English troops under Henry VIII assaulted ThÃ©rouanne, vanquished La Palice at the Battle of the Spurs, and caught Tournai. In Navarre, protection from Ferdinand's intrusion fallen; he quickly combined his hold over the whole area and moved to help another English hostile in the Guyenne. James IV of Scotland attacked England at the command of Louis; yet he neglected to draw Henry's consideration from France, and his passingâand the Scots' cataclysmic thrashingâat the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, finished Scotland's short contribution in the war. 

In the interim, Alviano, out of the blue left without French help, withdrew into the Veneto, sought after intently by the Spanish armed force under Cardona. While the Spanish were unfit to catch Padua even with decided Venetian opposition, they infiltrated profound into Venetian domain and by late September were in sight of Venice itself. Cardona endeavored an assault of the city that demonstrated to a great extent inadequate; at that point, having no water crafts with which to cross the tidal pond, turned back for Lombardy. Alviano, having been strengthened by several volunteers from the Venetian honorability, sought after Cardona and stood up to him outside Vicenza on 7 October. In the subsequent Battle of La Motta, the Venetian armed force was unequivocally vanquished, with numerous conspicuous aristocrats chop down outside the city dividers as they endeavored to escape. 

Be that as it may, the Holy League neglected to catch up on these triumphs. Cardona and Alviano kept on skirmishing in the Friuli for the remainder of 1513 and through 1514, battling a few uncertain fights, yet Cardona was unfit to gain any genuine ground. Henry VIII, having neglected to increase any noteworthy domain, finished up a different harmony with France. At long last, the passing of Julius left the League without a pioneer; Julius' successor to the Papacy, Leo X, was fairly less worried about military issues. 

The demise of Louis XII on 1 January 1515 conveyed Francis I to the position of authority. Having expected the title of Duke of Milan at his crowning liturgy, Francis quickly moved to recover his possessions in Italy. By July, Francis had collected a military in the DauphinÃ©. A joined Swiss and Papal power moved north from Milan to hinder the Alpine goes against him, however Francis, following the counsel of Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, kept away from the principle passes and walked rather through the valley of the Stura. The French vanguard astonished the Milanese rangers at Villafranca, catching Prospero Colonna; in the interim, Francis and the principle body of the French went up against the Swiss at the Battle of Marignano on 13 September. The Swiss development at first made progress; in any case, Francis' predominance in rangers and big guns, together with the opportune entry of Alviano (who had effectively stayed away from Cardona's military at Verona) on the morning of 14 September, prompted a deliberately unequivocal triumph for Francis and the Venetians. 

After the annihilation at Marignano, the League never again had the capacity or the will to proceed with the war. Francis progressed on Milan, catching the city on 4 October and expelling Sforza from the royal position. In December, he met with Leo at Bologna; the pope, who had meanwhile been left by the rest of his Swiss soldiers of fortune, surrendered Parma and Piacenza to Francis and Modena to the Duke of Ferrara. Consequently, Leo got assurances of French strategic distance in his proposed assault on the Duchy of Urbino. At long last, the Treaty of Noyon, marked by Francis and Charles V in August 1516, perceived French cases to Milan and Spanish cases to Naples, expelling Spain from the war. 

Maximilian waited, making another endeavor to attack Lombardy; his military neglected to achieve Milan before turning back, and by December 1516, he had gone into arrangements with Francis. The subsequent Treaty of Brussels acknowledged French control of Milan, yet in addition affirmed Venetian cases to the rest of the Imperial belongings in Lombardy (aside from Cremona), successfully finishing the war with an arrival to business as usual of 1508. The harmony, in any case, would last just four years; the decision of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 caused Francis, who had wanted the situation for himself, to start the Italian War of 1521â 26. The Italian Wars, in this way reignited, would then proceed until 1530 without noteworthy intrusion.
