She has begun researching paranoid ideas with the expectation that she will discover him once more. She trusts her second thoughts to her granddad Wilfred Mott, who met the Doctor before in "Voyage of the Damned". 

The Doctor and Donna, neither one mindful of the other's association, both explore Adipose Industries, which is showcasing an exceptional eating routine pill to the general population of London. They find that the pill's motto, "The Fat Just Walks Away", is strict. The pills utilize inert muscle to fat ratio to parthenogenetically make little white outsiders called Adipose that bring forth during the evening and leave the host's body. The Doctor and Donna independently penetrate the workplaces of Adipose Industries, each uninformed that the other is there. Donna hangs out in a can work space until they close, the Doctor remains in an extra space. As they investigate the structure, they all of a sudden experience each other through inverse windows in an office. They are gone up against by Miss Foster, an outsider who is utilizing Britain's overweight populace to make the Adipose infants for the Adiposian First Family. Miss Foster seeks after the Doctor and Donna around the structure, at last getting them in an office. She tells the Doctor that the Adipose lost their reproducing planet and employed Miss Foster to discover a substitution. The Doctor utilizes Miss Foster's sonic pen and his sonic screwdriver to make a redirection and getaway. 

Miss Foster quickens her arrangements, realizing that the Doctor will endeavor to stop her. All through London, the Adipose start to generate and before long number a few thousand. The Doctor and Donna avert all out crisis parthenogenesis happening, which would have slaughtered the individuals who had taken the pill, and the rest of the youthful Adipose advance toward Adipose Industries.

"Unruly accomplices" includes a few on-screen characters coming back to the arrangement. Catherine Tate was offered the chance to return as Donna Noble amid lunch with official maker Julie Gardner. Tate, who expected Gardner would get some information about showing up in a biopic, later let it be known was "the farthest thing from [her] mind". Tate's arrival was questionable among "Specialist Who" fans; the analysis she got was contrasted with Daniel Craig after he was given a role as James Bond. Howard Attfield, who showed up as Donna's dad Geoff in "The Runaway Bride", taped a few scenes for this scene, however kicked the bucket before his scenes for the rest of the period were finished. The makers resigned his character out of regard, and devoted him in the end credits for the scene. Maker Phil Collinson proposed exchanging his qualities to the random character Stan Mott from "Voyage of the Damned", and modifying his job as Donna's granddad. Official makers Russell T Davies and Gardner loved the thought and reviewed Bernard Cribbins to the job to re-film Attfield's scenes, with the character renamed as Wilfredâa name Davies favored for Donna's granddadâin time for the credits of "Voyage of the Damned" to be changed. 

Davies adopted an alternate strategy while composing the scene. David Tennant and Sarah Lancashire noticed the character of Miss Foster meant well however was ethically uncertain. The reason of the Adipose pill was similarly equivocal with uncommon symptoms, however was a "win-win circumstance" for anybody included. Davies based the character of Miss Foster on "Supernanny" star Jo Frost and Argentine altruist and legislator Eva PerÃ³n, and Lancashire contrasted her character with Mary Poppins. The Adipose are an alternate style to ordinary "Specialist Who" scalawags; opponents, for example, Lazarus in "The Lazarus Experiment" or the werewolf in "Like the devil" were solitary beasts intended to alarm the group of onlookers; the Adipose were composed as "charming" to give a "peculiar [and] strange" experience. 

Davies rolled out certain improvements to Donna's character. The character was "roundedÂ ... out from being a yelling fishwife to somebody who's very helpless and enthusiastic". Donna was composed to give a "burning" and "adult" demeanor towards the Doctor, contrary to Rose and Martha, who began to look all starry eyed at him. Tate believed Donna to be increasingly equivalent to the Doctor since her character did not romanticize him, enabling her to scrutinize his ethical quality all the more effectively.

The Adipose were motivated by a stuffed toy Davies claimed. The name originates from the logical name for muscle to fat ratio, fat tissue. Davies' concise laid out an "adorable" tyke amicable animal molded like a square of fat, like the Pillsbury Doughboy. Further interview with after creation group The Mill brought about the ears and the solitary tooth each Adipose has. Stephen Regelous, who won an Academy Award for his product "Gigantic", traveled to London to administer the making of the group enhancements. Regelous, a "Specialist Who" fan, was energetic about helping The Mill with enhancements, expressing that "When I originally discovered that the Mill was taking a shot at "Specialist Who", I was discreetly trusting that Massive may be utilized to make swarms of Daleks or Cybermen and with arrangement 4, I seized the chance to be included."
