Douglas MacArthur's departure from the Philippines 

On 11 March 1942, amid World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and individuals from his family and staff left the Philippine island of Corregidor and his powers, which were encompassed by the Japanese. They went in PT pontoons through stormy oceans watched by Japanese warships and achieved Mindanao two days after the fact. From that point, MacArthur and his gathering traveled to Australia in a couple of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, eventually touching base in Melbourne via train on 21 March. In Australia, he delivered his celebrated discourse in which he announced, "I came through and I will return". 

MacArthur was a notable and experienced officer with a recognized record in World War I, who had resigned from the United States Army in 1937 and had turned into a resistance consultant to the Philippine government. He was reviewed to dynamic obligation with the United States Army in July 1941, a couple of months before the flare-up of the Pacific War between the United States and the Empire of Japan, to move toward becoming leader of United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), joining the Philippine and United States Armies under one direction. 

By March 1942, the Japanese intrusion of the Philippines had constrained MacArthur to pull back his powers on Luzon to Bataan, while his central command and his family moved to Corregidor. The bound barrier of Bataan caught the creative energy of the American open. When the news from all fronts was consistently terrible, MacArthur turned into a living image of Allied protection from the Japanese. 

Expecting that Corregidor would before long fall, and MacArthur would be taken prisoner, President Franklin D. Roosevelt requested MacArthur to go to Australia. A submarine was made accessible, however MacArthur chose to get through the Japanese bar in PT water crafts under the direction of Lieutenant (junior evaluation) John D. Bulkeley. The staff MacArthur carried with him wound up known as the "Bataan Gang". They would turn into the core of his General Headquarters (GHQ) Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). 

Douglas MacArthur was a notable and experienced officer. The child of Lieutenant General Arthur MacArthur Jr., who was granted the Medal of Honor for his administrations in the American Civil War, MacArthur had graduated at the highest point of the United States Military Academy class of 1903. He was a confidant to his dad from 1905 to 1906, and to President Theodore Roosevelt from 1906 to 1907. Amid World War I he instructed the 84th Brigade of the 42nd (Rainbow) Division in the battling on the Western Front. After the war he filled in as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy, and as Chief of Staff of the United States Army. He resigned from the United States Army in 1937, and turned into a field marshal in the Philippine Army. 

MacArthur's activity was to prompt the Philippine government on resistance matters, and set up the Philippine barrier powers when the Philippines turned out to be completely free, which was to be in 1946. The Philippine Army, on the whole kept an eye on and officered by Filipinos with just few American counselors, was raised by enrollment, with two classes of 20,000 men being prepared every year, beginning in 1937. Furthermore, there was a standard U.S. Armed force battalion of around 10,000, half of whom were Filipinos serving in the U.S. Armed force known as Philippine Scouts. At the point when MacArthur was reviewed from retirement in July 1941 to move toward becoming officer of United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) at 61 years old, he joined the Philippine and United States Armies under one order. 

In preparing the Philippine Army for war, MacArthur confronted a tremendous errand. On a visit to the United States in 1937, MacArthur campaigned the Navy Department for the advancement of PT pontoonsâlittle, quick vessels outfitted with torpedoesâfor which he trusted that the topography of the Philippines, with its shallow waters and numerous bays, was preferably fit. The beginning Philippine Navy gained three, known as "Q" pontoons, after President Manuel L. Quezon. In August 1941, the U.S. Naval force made Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, under the order of Lieutenant (junior evaluation) John D. Bulkeley. It was a half-quality squadron, with just six PT water crafts rather than the typical twelve, numbered 31 to 35 and 41. It touched base at Manila in September 1941. It was comprehended that an armada comprising of more than PT water crafts would be required for a fruitful protection of the Philippines. 

As right on time as 1907, U.S. maritime and military organizers had inferred that it is unrealistic to repulse an attack of the Philippines. As well as could be expected be sought after was that the army could hold out on the Bataan promontory until help arrived. During the 1920s it was evaluated that they could do as such for around 60 days. By the 1930s, the organizers had turned out to be positively cynical in perspective on the expanded capacity of air ship, and by 1936 they were concurred that the Philippines ought to be discounted. In any case, in July 1941, this choice was suddenly switched, and it turned into the strategy of the U.S. government to protect and hold the Philippines. This was based, in any event to some degree, in the conviction that Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft could hinder or vanquish an attacking power. 

Not long after the Japanese intrusion of the Philippines in 1941, MacArthur, as per the pre-war plan, pronounced Manila an open city, and requested his powers on Luzon to pull back to Bataan. The Philippine government, the High Commissioner's office and MacArthur's USAFFE central command moved to Corregidor Island. In spite of the fact that the wards of U.S. military faculty had been sent back to the United States, MacArthur was, until his review from retirement, a Philippine government worker, so his family had stayed in the Philippines. MacArthur's significant other, Jean MacArthur, and youthful child, Arthur MacArthur IV, ran with him to Corregidor. Arthur commended his fourth birthday celebration on Corregidor, on 21 February 1942. At the point when an assistant got some information about Arthur's conceivable destiny, MacArthur answered: "He is a warrior's child." 

A large portion of the United States Asiatic Fleet resigned toward the south of the Philippines. A little power was deserted under the direction of Rear Admiral Francis W. Rockwell comprising of the submarine delicate , the submarine salvage dispatch , gunboats , and , minesweepers , and , five tugboats, three little watch vessels, and the PT pontoons of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three. The loss of Manila and the U.S. Maritime Base Subic Bay implied that fuel and extra parts turned out to be rare. The PT water crafts depended on "Canopus" and the skimming dry dock for help with upkeep. In spite of this, Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three kept on patroling. On 17 December, , and protected 296 survivors from SS "Corregidor", which had been conveying outcasts to Australia when it struck a mine and sank in Manila Bay. After seven days, steered into the rocks while watching south of Manila Bay, and was determined to flame to keep her being rescued by the Japanese. met a comparative destiny a month later, after its motors fizzled and it floated onto a reef. The PT water crafts assaulted foe flatboats off Luzon the evening of 23 January 1942, a little Japanese warship on 1 February, and a little vessel, most likely an angling trawler, on 17 February. 

In a message to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington, D.C., on 11 February, MacArthur reported that he and his family proposed to "share the destiny of the battalion". This implied surrender, best case scenario; MacArthur realized that demise from big guns shoot or an air assault was likewise likely. After three days, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, George C. Marshall, asked MacArthur to send his family away, however MacArthur disregarded this piece of the message. Singapore, when thought about secure, fell on 15 February, and in Washington, the likelihood that Corregidor would likewise fall and MacArthur would be taken prisoner was considered. MacArthur was America's most experienced general, yet would be of little use in a POW camp. Additionally, he had turned into a living image of Allied protection from the Japanese. The courageous however destined barrier of Bataan had caught the creative ability of the American open, who considered MacArthur to be the main Allied general who realized how to battle the Japanese. Walter R. Borneman noticed that: 

Secretary of State Cordell Hull raised the likelihood of MacArthur's clearing. Brigadier General Dwight Eisenhower wrote in his journal: 

The President considered sending MacArthur to Mindanao to organize the protection of the Philippines from that point, yet another thought emerged. The fall of Singapore fixed the destiny of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA), of which MacArthur's direction was ostensibly a section. Exchanges were held with the British about future order courses of action. A wide understanding was achieved that the United States would accept accountability for the Southwest Pacific. A senior American officer was required, and MacArthur was the undeniable decision. On 23 February, MacArthur got a message that had been drafted by the President, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and Marshall. It read: 

MacArthur reacted with a solicitation that he may choose the season of his takeoff. "Except if the correct minute is picked for this sensitive task", he expressed, "an unexpected breakdown may happen." "as to the genuine development", he went on, "I regard it fitting to go to Mindanao by joined utilization of surface art and submarine, and thus via air, further development by submarine being too tedious." Marshall answered that the President would enable him to pick the time and strategy for his takeoff. ABDA was broken down on 27 February, and MacArthur ostensibly went under Dutch order, yet was arranged to keep discussing legitimately with the War Department. 

MacArthur examined the PT vessel squadron on 1 March. With air spread given by his four residual Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, MacArthur and his significant other Jean took a half-hour ride on "PT-41". Despite the fact that the ocean was quiet, Jean still felt squeamish. Apparently, the motivation behind MacArthur's visit was giving Bulkeley the Distinguished Service Cross for sinking a "unidentified 5,000-ton adversary transport with torpedoes without genuine harm to his ship or loss to his team", yet a while later MacArthur took Bulkeley aside and inquired as to whether it is conceivable to make the voyage through unfamiliar waters during the evening in PT pontoons. Bulkeley disclosed to him that it would be "simple." 

At the point when some days go with no further word on the issue, follow-up messages were sent on 6 and 9 March. By 10 March, MacArthur had chosen that the Bataan front was not in risk of approaching breakdown, and answered that he intended to withdraw on 15 March, when the submarine was planned to touch base at Corregidor. Radio communicates in the United States calling for MacArthur to be set in control in Australia had been gotten by MacArthur's base camp in Corregidor, and it must be accepted that the Japanese had heard them as well. There were foreboding signs: Japanese surface watches had been ventured up in the Subic Bay zone, and there were reports of Japanese destroyers traveling north from the southern Philippines. MacArthur in this manner chose not to hang tight for the "Grant", yet to leave at the earliest opportunity, by PT watercraft the evening of 11 March. Significant General Jonathan M. Wainwright was left in order on Bataan and Corregidor. "When I get back", MacArthur let him know, "in case you're still on Bataan, I'll make you a lieutenant general." Wainwright answered: "I'll be on Bataan in case I'm as yet alive." 

Of the choice to withdraw by PT pontoon instead of hang tight for the submarine, Lieutenant Robert B. Kelly, official officer of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, and authority of "PT-34", later reviewed: 

Bulkeley and his groups updated the PT water crafts for the voyage. The majority of the motors had performed hard war administration, and had been worked for twofold the prescribed mileage without redesign. Subsequently, they were diminished to working at half speed. Since there were no new parts, the gaskets, which regularly would have been disposed of, must be painstakingly cleaned and supplanted. Every PT vessel would convey twenty 55-gallon drums of extra fuel on the deck. This decreased the top speed of the pontoons to about . To account for the travelers, Bulkeley needed to leave 32 of his men behind, who might be sent to battle as infantry on Bataan. 

MacArthur's head of staff, Major General Richard K. Sutherland, drew up the traveler records. Rockwell and his head of staff, Captain Herbert J. Beam, were requested to go with MacArthur. They were at that point compelled to return by submarine, yet this was changed to going with MacArthur when his date of flight was presented. A United States Army Air Corps officer, Brigadier General Harold H. George, was incorporated in line with the United States Army Air Forces. 

MacArthur was joined by his family: his significant other Jean, four-year-old child Arthur, and Arthur's Cantonese "amah", Ah Cheu. MacArthur later safeguarded his choice to take her rather than an American medical attendant. "Scarcely any individuals outside the Orient", he stated, "know how totally an individual from the family an "amah" can progress toward becoming, and Ah Cheu had been with us since Arthur's introduction to the world. In view of her relationship to my family, her demise would have been sure had she been abandoned." 

In the event that a specialist was required, Major Charles H. Morhouse was called from Bataan to go with the gathering. The staying thirteen were individuals from MacArthur's staff, who were steadfast and encountered; some had been with MacArthur for a considerable length of time. Making another staff in Australia would have required some serious energy, while taking his current one would empower him to initiate work not long after entry in Australia. They would be more significant there than in the Philippines, where they would have been taken prisoner. Sutherland included two of his own men: his colleague, Lieutenant Colonel Francis H. Wilson, and his stenographer, Master Sergeant Paul P. Rogers. Advanced from private that day, Rogers was the main enrolled man on the rundown, which he composed. Various men gave him letters to post. 

Since there was no sustenance for the travelers on the PT vessels, Jean and MacArthur's confidant, Lieutenant Colonel Sidney L. Episode, stuffed tins of nourishment into four duffel packs, one for each watercraft. Episode expelled the four-star rank number plates from MacArthur's vehicle so they could be utilized in Australia, and took a sleeping cushion for the MacArthurs to lie on. Stories later circled that it was loaded with money or gold. Different stories had it that furnishings from MacArthur's living arrangement in the Manila Hotel had been stacked on board the PT vessels, even, in one rendition of the story, the piano. Truth be told, every traveler was restricted to one bit of gear gauging or less. Jean took a little bag with some garments. It donned a name from the Hotel New Grand in Yokohama, where she remained amid her special night. Ok Cheu enclosed her assets by a tissue. MacArthur took nothing. 

Just "PT-41", which conveyed MacArthur and his family, withdrew from Corregidor's North Dock. The travelers of the rest of the vessels were taken to Bataan in dispatches and boarded their PT water crafts there. While his family boarded, MacArthur addressed Major General George F. Moore, the officer of the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays. "George", he let him know, "keep the banner flying. I'm returning." 

"PT-41" left at 19:45 on 11 March and joined the other three 15 minutes after the fact. A naval force minelayer drove the PT water crafts through the defensive minefield in single document. The pontoons at that point accepted a precious stone arrangement, with "PT-41" in the number one spot and "PT-34" raising the back. Whenever assaulted by the Japanese, "PT-41" was to escape while the other three pontoons drew in the adversary. The oceans were moderate, however a large portion of the travelers rapidly ended up nauseous. MacArthur later reviewed: 

Amid the night, the four pontoons wound up isolated. Bulkeley invested energy searching for the other three vessels, yet was unfit to discover them in the dimness. At day break he surrendered, and set out toward one of the elective concealing spots. Kelly's "PT-34" was the first to achieve the meeting point, a bay on Tagauayan Island, two hours late at 09:30. There was no indication of different water crafts, and Rockwell, in almost the same situation with Kelly, was a long way from persuaded that Kelly had discovered the right island. A few fixes were made, and the vessel was refueled by hand siphons from the drums. Two men were posted on the island's tallest slope to keep an eye out for the Japanese and different water crafts. 

"PT-32", which had just two great motors, had straggled behind the others. Around day break, Schumacher spotted what had all the earmarks of being a Japanese destroyer heading towards him. He ejected his fuel drums so he could expand speed and keep running from it. He requested his team to man the .50-gauge assault rifles and prepare to dispatch torpedoes. Associated arranged to hurl a sleeping enclosure sack loaded up with code books over the edge. Nonetheless, as the light improved, and the vessel moved nearer, another glance through the binoculars uncovered that it was anything but a Japanese destroyer by any stretch of the imagination, yet "PT-41", conveying an irate Bulkeley. Schumacher was requested to recuperate the drums he had casted off, yet this turned out to be a tedious assignment, and a hazardous one without trying to hide, and it must be relinquished after just a couple of drums were recouped. Bulkeley had his heavy armament specialists sink the rest. The two water crafts at that point covered up for the day in a close-by bay. 

Toward the evening, "PT-41" and "PT-32" advanced toward Tagauayan, where they discovered "PT-34". There was a discourse about whether to continue to Mindanao, or hang tight for "Grant". Bulkeley cautioned that the oceans may even be higher. In any case, since there was no affirmation that the submarine would make it, MacArthur chose to keep, leaving in sunshine at 18:00 to make certain to meet their air transport there. Since "PT-32" had no fuel to make Mindanao, its travelers were partitioned between "PT-41" and "PT-34". Not long after they had left, "PT-35" belatedly touched base at the meeting point. Akers found the team of "PT-32" there, and found that the other two vessels had been and gone. He in this way set out for Cagayan de Oro too. 

At 19:00, around an hour after they had left Tagauayan, "PT-34" and "PT-41" detected a Japanese cruiser. Bulkeley made a sharp turn due west, and headed at top speed, about , into the setting sun. Regardless of whether as a result of the high waves, the glare of the sun, or straightforward distractedness, the cruiser did not spot them. After 12 pm, the climate started to exacerbate, with substantial swells and sporadic squalls. Kelly later reviewed: 

Before sun-up, the breezes and swells had died down, however the deferral brought about by the awful climate had hindered the two vessels, and they presently needed to traverse the Mindanao Sea in light. Cagayan was located not long after 06:30 on 13 March. In spite of the fact that "PT-34" had driven right from Tagauayan, Kelly currently let Bulkeley lead the pack, as he had the channel graphs. "PT-41" in this manner pulled up at the wharf first, with MacArthur on the bow. They were met by Colonel William Morse, an officer on the staff of the Brigadier General William F. Sharp, the officer of U.S. powers on Mindanao. MacArthur told Bulkeley "I'm giving each officer and man here the Silver Star for courage. You've removed me from the jaws of death, and I won't overlook it." 

A couple of hours after the fact, "PT-35" came to Cagayan. Willoughby later reviewed: 

USS "License", under the order of Lieutenant WrefordÂ G. Chapple, came to Tagauayan on 13 March, and discovered "PT-32". With two of his three motors out of activity, Schumacher felt that his vessel was never again fit for sailing. He had Chapple pulverize the vessel with "Grant" deck weapon. Chapple then took the fifteen "PT-32" crew members back to Corregidor. There, eight of the group were landed, while Chapple set out forty additional travelers, thirty-six of them codebreakers. In any case, Chapple was requested to lead an ordinary war watch, which he did. He at long last achieved Australia on 7 April. Ignorant of this, Bulkeley endeavored to find "PT-32". Throughout the following couple of days he flew over the region as a traveler in different flying machine, including a P-35 and a P-40, in the expectation of discovering it. 

The administrator of U.S. Armed force Forces in Australia, Lieutenant General George H. Brett, got a radiogram from General Marshall in Washington, D.C., cautioning him that MacArthur would demand aircraft to transport his gathering from Mindanao to Australia. A consequent message from MacArthur mentioned his "most experienced pilots, and the best accessible planes in top condition", however the main long-run airplane that Brett had were Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses of the nineteenth Bombardment Group which had seen hard administration in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies crusades. He in this manner moved toward Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary, the administrator of maritime powers in the Anzac Area, to request an advance of some of twelve recently arrived Navy B-17s. Leary, who had a notoriety for declining demands except if he could perceive how the Navy would profit, turned Brett down. 

Brett in this manner sent four of the nineteenth Bombardment Group's old planes. Two were compelled to turn back with motor inconvenience. One of the others incidentally dumped of its fuel. The pilot flew on, and almost made it to Del Monte Field, be that as it may, only a couple of miles from his goal, the fuel tanks ran dry and the motors halted. The B-17 crash arrived in the ocean. Two of the group were slaughtered, yet the rest made it to shore, and thereupon to Del Monte Field. Just a single B-17, guided by Lieutenant Harl Pease, came to Del Monte, and this B-17 was in poor condition, without any brakes and a broken supercharger. Sharp arranged it back to Australia before MacArthur arrived. In spite of the absence of brakes, Pease made the arrival trip, conveying sixteen travelers. 

Along these lines, with the landing of "PT-35", the majority of MacArthur's gathering had achieved Mindanao securely, however there were no flying machine at Del Monte Field to meet them. They were taken to the Del Monte Plantation, where they were stopped in the visitor houses, and ate in the clubhouse. MacArthur sent a few sharp messages to Brett in Melbourne and Marshall in Washington. On their second day there, a Filipino lady arrived who needed to address MacArthur. Her child was battling on Luzon, and she had strolled with the expectation that the general would have some news about him. He didn't, however the way that she knew about MacArthur's essence was aggravating to the gathering, as the Japanese were just away, at Davao on the south bank of Mindanao. 

Brett returned to Leary, hoping to be turned down once more, however this time, Leary gave Brett the flying machine he needed. "Maybe", Brett hypothesized, "Leary had gotten notification from Washington". The recently framed 40th Reconnaissance Squadron kept an eye on the planes. One B-17 turned back, however two made it to Del Monte Field on 16 March, arriving in obscurity on a runway lit by flares. Lieutenant Frank P. Bostrom, the pilot of the main plane, determined that everybody could be conveyed in only two planes on the off chance that they left the greater part of their stuff behind. They isolated into two gatherings and the two planes took off at 01:30 on 17 March. MacArthur rode in the radio administrator's seat, which did not should be kept an eye on as the flying machine were going under radio quietness. For the majority of the travelers, the excursion was dull and cold, with just a cover among them and the metal skin of the air ship. 

As the two planes moved toward Darwin, word was gotten that a Japanese air strike was in advancement there. The two B-17s along these lines flew on to Batchelor Airfield, where they contacted down at 09:30. MacArthur granted Silver Stars to the groups of the two planes. Brett's head of staff, Brigadier General Ralph Royce, was close by to welcome them, and Brett had sent two Australian National Airways DC-3s to convey them to Melbourne. Be that as it may, Jean presently would not fly any further, so MacArthur requested a motorcade to take them to the closest railroad station, which was at Alice Springs, away. Sutherland had gotten expression of an approaching Japanese air assault, and asked Morhouse to intercede. Morhouse revealed to MacArthur that Arthur, who had experienced severely nausea and motion illness, was on an intravenous feed, and couldn't ensure that he would endure the excursion over the desert. MacArthur at that point consented to take the planes to Alice Springs. Sutherland had Huff rush everybody onto the airplane, which took off as the air strike alarm sounded. 

At Alice Springs, the gathering split up. MacArthur, his family, Sutherland, Morhouse and Huff took an exceptional train that Brett had acquired from the Australians, while the remainder of the staff flew down to Melbourne by means of Adelaide in the DC-3s. His celebrated discourse, in which he stated, "I came through and I will return", was first made at Terowie railroad station in South Australia, on 20 March, where he changed trains. On 21 March, MacArthur's adventure was finished when his train folded into Melbourne's Spencer Street station, where he was welcomed by the Australian Minister for the Army, Frank Forde. 

Roosevelt issued an open explanation on 17 March: 

On Bataan, the response to MacArthur's break was blended, with numerous American and Filipino troops feeling unpleasant and sold out. At the point when Wainwright broke the news to his officers "they were all at first discouraged by the newsÂ â¦ But I before long observed that they saw similarly as I saw." Some individuals with relatives in the Philippines were overwhelmed. One kept in touch with Roosevelt that "Nothing you could have done would have broken their resolve and that of their folks at home so completely". Wainwright held out on Corregidor until 6 May. To Joseph Goebbels, MacArthur was an "escaping general", while Benito Mussolini named him a defeatist. Marshall chose that the most ideal approach to counter this was to grant MacArthur the Medal of Honor. 

In April 1942, Bulkeley drove his squadron in an assault on the . The PT pontoons scored a hit on the cruiser, however the torpedo was a failure, and neglected to detonate. No harm came about. With the loss of Cebu City, there were no more torpedoes, so the dynamic professions of the rest of the water crafts of Bulkeley's squadron reached an end. MacArthur gave PT vessel officers a high need to be flown out from Mindanao. Bulkeley was flown out on MacArthur's requests on 13 April. Knox, Kelly and Akers were cleared on 23 April, and Brantingham additionally made one of the last flights out from Mindanao. Sharp surrendered on Mindanao on 10 May. 

MacArthur consequently assigned Bulkeley for the Medal of Honor. The Commander in Chief, U.S. Armada, Admiral Ernest King was not going to give MacArthur a chance to grant the Medal of Honor to a maritime officer, so he composed a reference for Bulkeley in the interest of the Navy. Roosevelt exhibited it to Bulkeley in a function in the Oval Office on 4 August 1942. Bulkeley added to a book about his PT squadron's adventures, entitled "They Were Expendable". Parts were serialized in "Peruser's Digest" and "Life" magazines and it turned into a smash hit in 1942. In 1944, it was adjusted as a film of a similar name, with Robert Montgomery playing a character dependent on Bulkeley, John Wayne one dependent on Kelly, and Donna Reed in the job of an Army nurture with whom Kelly had a concise contact. After war investigation found that a large portion of the book's cases were overstated. 

The staff that MacArthur carried with him from Corregidor framed the core of General Headquarters (GHQ) Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). The "Bataan Gang", as they came to be called, stayed with MacArthur for the span, and were noted for their over the top reliability to him. So too was Bulkeley, who commended MacArthur as "the best broad just as statesman since George Washington", and hailed his choice to escape on PT pontoons as a flash of brilliance. MacArthur inevitably stayed faithful to his commitment, and came back to the Philippines. The Bataan Gang came back to Corregidor in March 1945 on four PT water crafts.
