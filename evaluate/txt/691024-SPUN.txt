Amid the second a large portion of a surprising change occurred and England began playing a far reaching diversion many had questioned they were equipped for creating. A 3â 0 deficiency was transformed into a 35â 3 win, with England scoring six attempts. 

In the 35â 3 win, three of England's attempts were scored by Chris Oti, a player who had made a notoriety for himself that season as a speedster on the left wing.

Andy Robinson, Woodward's successor, accused the absence of authority over players for his group's fruitless record. Brian Ashton, who took over from Robinson, deliberately named his playing squad for Six Nations coordinates in 2007 right off the bat with the expectation that their clubs would not play them in the end of the week before a Test. The RFU and the Premiership clubs are arranging a comparative arrangement to the one of every 2001 that will empower worldwide players to be discharged into the England squad before global matches.
