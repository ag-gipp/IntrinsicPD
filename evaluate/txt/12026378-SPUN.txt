Greece runestones 

The Greece runestones (Swedish: "Greklandsstenarna", Greek: "Î¡Î¿ÏÎ½Î¹ÎºÎ­Ï Î»Î¯Î¸Î¿Î¹ ÎÎ»Î»Î¬Î´Î±Ï") are around 30 runestones containing data identified with voyages made by Norsemen to the Byzantine Empire. They were made amid the Viking Age until around 1100 and were engraved in the Old Norse language with Scandinavian runes. Every one of the stones have been found in advanced Sweden, the greater part in Uppland (18 runestones) and SÃ¶dermanland (7 runestones). Most were recorded in memory of individuals from the Varangian Guard who stayed away forever home, yet a couple of engravings notice men who came back with riches, and a rock in Ed was engraved on the requests of a previous officer of the Guard. 

On these runestones "Grikkland" ("Greece") shows up in three engravings, "Grikk(j)ar" ("Greeks") shows up in 25 engravings, two stones allude to men as "grikkfari" ("voyager to Greece") and one stone alludes to "Grikkhafnir" ("Greek harbors"). Among different runestones which allude to campaigns abroad, the main gatherings which are practically identical in number are the purported "Britain runestones" that notice endeavors to England and the 26 Ingvar runestones that allude to a Viking undertaking to the Middle East. 

The stones change in size from the little whetstone from Timans which measures Â ÃÂ Â ÃÂ  to the rock in Ed which is in outline. The vast majority of them are decorated with different runestone styles that were being used amid the eleventh century, and particularly styles that were a piece of the Ringerike style (eight or nine stones) and the Urnes style (eight stones). 

Since the principal revelations by Johannes Bureus in the late sixteenth century, these runestones have been as often as possible distinguished by researchers, with numerous stones found amid a national look for noteworthy landmarks in the late seventeenth century. A few stones were recorded by Richard Dybeck in the nineteenth century. The most recent stone to be found was in Nolinge, close Stockholm, in 1952. 

Scandinavians had filled in as hired soldiers in the Roman armed force numerous hundreds of years before the Viking Age, however amid when the stones were made, there were a bigger number of contacts among Scandinavia and Byzantium than at some other time. Swedish Viking ships were normal on the Black Sea, the Aegean Sea, the Sea of Marmara and on the more extensive Mediterranean Sea. Greece was home to the Varangian Guard, the world class protector of the Byzantine Emperor, and until the Komnenos administration in the late eleventh century, most individuals from the Varangian Guard were Swedes. As late as 1195, Emperor Alexios Angelos sent emissaries to Denmark, Norway and Sweden mentioning 1,000 warriors from every one of the three kingdoms. Positioned in Constantinople, which the Scandinavians alluded to as "MiklagarÃ°r" (the "Incomparable City"), the Guard pulled in youthful Scandinavians of the sort that had formed it since its creation in the late tenth century. 

The expansive number of men who withdrew for the Byzantine Empire is shown by the way that the medieval Scandinavian laws still contained laws concerning voyages to Greece when they were recorded after the Viking Age. The more seasoned adaptation of the "Westrogothic law", which was recorded by Eskil Magnusson, the lawspeaker of VÃ¤stergÃ¶tland 1219â 1225, expressed that "no man may get a legacy (in Sweden) while he abides in Greece". The later form, which was recorded from 1250 to 1300, includes that "nobody may acquire from such an individual as was not a living beneficiary when he left". Likewise the old Norwegian "GulaÃ¾ingslÃ¶g" contains a comparable law: "yet on the off chance that (a man) goes to Greece, at that point he who is next in line to acquire will hold his property". 

Around 3,000 runestones from the Viking Age have been found in Scandinavia of which c. 2,700 were raised inside what today is Sweden. Upwards of 1,277 of them were brought up in the territory of Uppland alone. The Viking Age concurred with the Christianisation of Scandinavia, and in numerous locale c. half of the stone engravings have hints of Christianity. In Uppland, c. 70% of the engravings are expressly Christian, which is appeared engraved crosses or included Christian supplications, while just a couple runestones are unequivocally agnostic. The runestone custom presumably vanished before 1100, and at the most recent by 1125. 

Among the runestones of the Viking Age, 9.1â 10% report that they were brought up in memory of individuals who traveled to another country, and the runestones that notice Greece comprise the biggest gathering of them. Moreover, there is a gathering of three or four runestones that remember men who kicked the bucket in southern Italy, and who were presumably individuals from the Varangian Guard. The main gathering of stones practically identical in number to the Greece runestones are those that notice England, trailed by the c. 26 Ingvar runestones brought up in the wake of the portentous Ingvar endeavor to Persia. 

BlÃ¶ndal and Benedikz (2007) note that the greater part of the Greece runestones are from Uppland and relate it to the way that it was the most well-known zone to begin a voyage to Greece, and the region from which most Rus' begun. In any case, as confirmed by Jansson (1987), the way that the vast majority of these runestones were brought up in Uppland and SÃ¶dermanland does not really imply that their number mirrors the organization of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two territories are those that have the best convergences of runic engravings. 

Not each one of the individuals who are recognized on the Greece runestones were essentially individuals from the Varangian Guard, and some may have gone to Greece as shippers or kicked the bucket there while going by on a journey. The way that a voyage to Greece was related with incredible threat is affirmed by the way that a lady had a runestone made in memory of herself "previously" she withdrew on a journey to Jerusalem: "IngirÃºn HarÃ°ardÃ³ttir had runes graven for herself; she would go East and out to Jerusalem. FÃ³tr cut the runes." However, BlÃ¶ndal and Benedikz (2007) express that in spite of the fact that there were different explanations behind going to Greece, it is sure that the greater part of the runestones were made in memory of individuals from the Varangian Guard who kicked the bucket there. All things considered, some runestones recount men who came back with expanded riches, and an engraving on a rock in Ed was charged by a previous skipper of the Guard, Ragnvaldr. 

The explanations behind the runestone convention involve banter yet they incorporate legacy issues, status and the regarding of the perished. A few runestones unequivocally remember legacy, for example, the Ulunda stone and the Hansta stone, yet by far most of the runestones just tell who brought the stone and up in memory of whom. 

A view held by researchers, for example, Erik Moltke and Sven B. F. Jansson holds that the runestones were basically the aftereffect of the numerous Viking undertakings from Scandinavia, or to refer to Jansson (1987): 

At the point when the extraordinary undertakings were finished, the old exchange courses shut, and the Viking ships never again influenced prepared each spring for voyages to east to and west, at that point that implied the finish of the cutting and setting up of rune stones in the correct feeling of the term. They might be known as the landmarks of the Viking voyages, and the touchy peruser may get in a significant number of their engravings the Viking's affection for experience and adventures of tumultuous brave. 

Sawyer (2000), then again, responds against this usually held view and remarks that most by far of the runestones were brought up in memory of individuals who are not answered to have passed on abroad. She contends that couple of men who traveled to another country were respected with dedications and the reason is that the runestones were for the most part raised due to worries at home, for example, legacy issues. Such concerns would have emerged when a family realized that a relative would not come back from abroad. 

Beneath pursues an introduction of the Greece runestones dependent on data gathered from the Rundata venture, composed by area. The interpretations from runic engravings into institutionalized Old Norse are in Old East Norse (OEN), the Swedish and Danish lingo, to encourage correlation with the engravings, while the English interpretation given by Rundata give the names in the standard vernacular, Old West Norse (OWN), the Icelandic and Norwegian tongue. 

There is a long-standing routine with regards to composing transliterations of the runes in Latin characters in boldface and deciphering the content into a standardized type of the language with italic kind. This training exists in light of the fact that the two types of rendering a runic content must be kept unmistakable. By appearing unique engraving as well as transliterating, deciphering and deciphering, researchers present the investigation in a way that enables the peruser to pursue their elucidation of the runes. Each progression presents difficulties, yet most Younger Futhark engravings are viewed as simple to decipher. 

In transliterations, *, :, Ã, and + speak to regular word dividers, while Ã· speaks to less normal ones. Enclosures, ( ), speak to harmed runes that can't be related to conviction, and square sections, [ ], speak to groupings of runes that have been lost, yet can be recognized gratitude to early portrayals by researchers. A short hyphen, - , demonstrates that there is a rune or other sign that can't be distinguished. A progression of three full stops ... demonstrates that runes are accepted to have existed in the position, yet have vanished. The two partitioning signs | isolate a rune into two Latin letters, since runemasters regularly cut a solitary rune rather than two continuous ones. Â§P and Â§Q present two elective readings of an engraving that worry numerous words, while Â§A, Â§B and Â§C present the distinctive pieces of an engraving as they may show up on various sides of a runestone. 

Edge sections, , show that there is a succession of runes that can't be deciphered with assurance. Other extraordinary signs are "Ã¾" and "Ã°", where the first is the thistle letter which speaks to a voiceless dental fricative as "th" in English "thing". The second letter is eth which represents a voiced dental fricative as "th" in English "them". The "Ê" sign speaks to the yr rune, and "Ã´" is equivalent to the Icelandic O caudata "Ç«". 

Each runic engraving is appeared with its ID code that is utilized in academic writing to allude to the engraving, and it is just required to give its initial two pieces. The initial segment is a couple of letters that speak to the territory where the runic engraving shows up, for example U for Uppland, SÃ¶ for SÃ¶dermanland and DR for Denmark. The second part speaks to the request in which the engraving is displayed in authority national distributions (for example "Sveriges runinskrifter"). Therefore U 73 implies that the runestone was the 73rd runic engraving in Uppland that was recorded in "Sveriges runinskrifter". On the off chance that the engraving was recorded later than the official distribution, it is recorded by the production where it was first portrayed, for example SÃ¶ Fv1954;20, where "SÃ¶" speaks to SÃ¶dermanland, "Fv" represents the yearly distribution "FornvÃ¤nnen", 1954 is the time of the issue of "FornvÃ¤nnen" and 20 is the page in the production. 

There are upwards of 18 runestones in Uppland that relate data about men who made a trip to Greece, the majority of whom kicked the bucket there. 

Runestone U 73 (area) was most likely raised to clarify the request of legacy from two men who passed on as Varangians. It is in the style Pr3 which is a piece of the more broad Urnes style. The stone, which is of grayish rock estimating in tallness and in width, is raised on an incline some north of HÃ¤gerstalund ranch, in the past Hansta(lund). The stone was found by Johan PeringskiÃ¶ld amid the national look for notable landmarks in the late seventeenth century. The stone offers a similar message as U 72, together with which it once shaped a landmark, yet U 72 was moved to Skansen in 1896. The last stone relates that "these stones" were raised by GerÃ°arr and JÃ¶rundr in memory of Ernmundr and Ingimundr. Thusly, U 73's expression "Inga's children" and "they passed on in Greece" allude to Ernmundr and Ingimundr. Ernmundr and Ingimundr had acquired from their dad, yet they left for the Byzantine Empire and passed on there as Varangians. As they had not fathered any youngsters, their mom Inga acquired their property, and when she kicked the bucket, her siblings GerÃ°arr and JÃ¶rundr acquired from her. These two siblings at that point brought the two commemorations up to pay tribute to their nephews, which was most likely because of the nephews having separated themselves in the South. Be that as it may, it might have likewise been in appreciation for riches accumulated by the nephews abroad. In the meantime, the landmark served to report how the property had gone starting with one family then onto the next. Sawyer (2000), then again, recommends that on the grounds that the two engravings don't specify who charged them, the main inevitable petitioner to the fortune, and the one that had the stones made, may have been the congregation. The runemaster has been recognized as VisÃ¤te.

Runestone U 104 (unique area) is in red sandstone estimating in stature and in width. It was first recorded by Johannes Bureus in 1594. It was given as one of a couple (the other is U 1160 ) to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford in 1687 upon the solicitation of ruler James II of England to lord Charles XI of Sweden requesting two runestones to add to the Oxford University accumulation. It is in the Urnes (Pr5) style. It was brought by Ãorsteinn up in memory of his dad Sveinn and his sibling ÃÃ³rir, both of whom went to Greece, and in conclusion in memory of his mom. The stone is marked by the runemaster Ãpir whose Old Norse is outstanding for its strange utilization of the haglaz rune (á¼), as in cottage for Old Norse "Ãºt" ("out"). The sporadic utilization of the h-phoneme is a lingo attribute that has endure is as yet trademark for the cutting edge Swedish tongue of Roslagen, one of the areas where Ãpir was dynamic.

Runestone U 112 (area), an expansive rock estimating in boundary, is adjacent to a lush way named Kyrkstigen ("church way") in Ed. It has been known to researchers since Johannes Bureus' first runological campaign in 1594, and it dates to the mid-eleventh century. 

The stone bears runic engravings on two of its sides, alluded to as U 112 An and B. The semantic criticalness of the engravings lies in the utilization of the haglaz (á¼) rune to signify the velar approximant (as in "Ragnvaldr"), something that would wind up regular after the end of the Viking Age. The engraving likewise incorporates some dabbed runes, and the ansuz () rune is utilized for the phoneme. 

The engravings are in the Urnes style (Pr4), and they were authorized by a previous chief of the Varangian Guard named Ragnvaldr in memory of his mom just as in his very own respect. Not very many could flaunt returning home with the respect of having been the chief of the Varangian Guard. Besides, the name "Ragnvaldr" demonstrates that he had a place with the higher echelons of Old Norse society, and that he may have been a relative of the decision line. 

Ragnvald's maternal granddad, ÃnÃ¦mr, is referenced on two extra runestones in Uppland, U 328 and U 336. Runestone U 328 relates that Ragnvaldr had two aunties, GyrÃ­Ã°r and GuÃ°laug. Also, runestone U 336 includes that Ulf of Borresta, who got three Danegelds in England, was ÃnÃ¦m's fatherly nephew and hence Ragnvald's first cousin. He was presumably the equivalent Ragnvaldr whose demise is connected in the Hargs brother runic engravings, which would likewise interface him to Estrid and the rich Jarlabanke tribe. 

Thinking about Ragnvald's experience, it isn't amazing that he rose to turn into an officer of the Varangian Guard: he was a well off chieftain who conveyed numerous driven troopers to Greece.

Runestone U 136 (area) is in the Pr2 (Ringerike) style, and it once shaped a landmark together with U 135. It is a dull grayish stone that is tall and wide. In 1857, Richard Dybeck noticed that it had been found in the dirt five years sooner. A little piece of it had stuck up over the dirt and when the landowner was working the land and found it, he had it raised again on a similar spot. A few pieces were inadvertently worn down by the landowner and the upper pieces of certain runes were lost. 

The stone was initially raised by a rich woman named ÃstrÃ­Ã°r in memory of her significant other Eysteinn, and Sawyer (2000) recommends it to have been one of a few stones made in a pull of-war over legacy. There is vulnerability regarding why Eysteinn went to Greece and Jerusalem, due to the understanding of "sÅkja" (authenticated as "sotti" in the past tense). It signifies "look for" however it can signify "assault" as on the stones SÃ¶ 166 and N 184, yet additionally "visit" or "travel". Subsequently, Eysteinn has been distinguished as one of the principal Swedes to make a journey to Jerusalem, however Jesch (2001) takes note of that making a decision from the other runic precedents, the "assault" sense is more probable. The interpretation of "sÅkja" as "assault" is likewise picked by the Rundata venture (see beneath). It is one of two Jarlabanke Runestones that notice voyagers abroad, the other being U140, beneath.

At first, the part was moved to a slant close to the street among Hagby and TÃ¤by church, yet in 1930, it was moved alongside the street. It is one of the Jarlabanke Runestones and it makes reference to a man who voyaged abroad (think about U 136, above).

The ruddy rock stone is walled into the sacristy of Angarn Church c. over the ground, estimating in tallness and in width. Johannes Bureus (1568â 1652) referenced the stone, however for no good reason, it was disregarded amid the national scan for notable landmarks in 1667â 1684.

Runestone U 270 was found in Smedby (area) close Vallentuna and portrayed by Johan Hadorph and associate, for Johan PeringskiÃ¶ld, amid the national look for memorable landmarks in 1667â 84. Richard Dybeck noted in 1867 that he had seen the runestone unblemished three years already, however that it had been utilized for the development of a storm cellar in 1866. Dybeck sued the blameworthy rancher, and the indictment was finished by the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities. The documentation from the court case demonstrates that it had been remaining at the residence and that it had been exploded multiple times into little pieces that could be utilized for the development of the cellar. Recreation of the runestone was regarded unthinkable. The stone was tall and wide, and it was brought up in memory of a dad who seems to have headed out to Greece.

It was not until 1942 that it was expelled from the turret and was raised once more a couple of paces away. The stone is in light grayish rock. It is tall over the ground and wide. The contractual worker of the runestone was named "Folkmarr" and it is a name that is generally obscure from Viking Age Scandinavia, in spite of the fact that it is known to have existed after the end of the Viking Age. It was then again a typical name in West Germanic dialects and particularly among the Franks.

Runestone U 374 was a runestone that once existed in Ãrby (area). In 1673, amid the national scan for notable landmarks, Abraham Winge revealed that there were two runestones remaining at Ãrby. In 1684, PeringskiÃ¶ld went to Ãrby so as to report and portray the stones, yet he found just a single standing (). Rather he found the second, or a third runestone, U 374, as the base piece of a flame stove. The utilization of the stone as a chimney was , and the last time somebody expounded on having seen it was in 1728. PeringskiÃ¶ld's illustration is thusly the main documentation of the engraving that exists. The stature of the stone was and its width , and it is credited to the runemaster Ãsmund KÃ¥resson.

Runestone U 431 (area) was found, similar to U 430, in a field having a place with the hotel of Ãshusby when stones were exploded so as to set up the field for developing harvests in 1889. As the stone was lying with the engraving side downwards, it was exploded and it was not until the shards were grabbed that the runes were found. The runestone was patched with concrete and moved to the chamber of the congregation of Norrsunda. The stone is in somewhat blue dark gneiss, and it gauges in tallness and in width. The surfaces are abnormally smooth. It is in the Ringerike (Pr2) style, and it is credited to the runemaster Ãsmund KÃ¥resson. It was raised by a dad and mother, TÃ³fa and Hemingr, in memory of their child, Gunnarr, who kicked the bucket "among the Greeks", and it is extremely unordinary that the mother is referenced before the dad.

A piece of the runestone U 446 in Droppsta (area) is just bore witness to from a documentation made amid the national look for notable landmarks in the seventeenth century, and amid the planning of the Uppland segment of "Sveriges runinskrifter" (1940â 1943) researchers hunt ineffectively down any remaining parts of the stone. The section was what survived from the base piece of a runestone and it seems to have been in two bits of which one had the initial segment of the engraving and the second one the last part. The section seems to have been c. high and wide and its Urnes style is credited to either Pr3 or Pr4. The runes isifara have been translated as "Ã¦ist-fari" which signifies "explorer to Estonia", which is known from an engraving in SÃ¶dermanland, yet they are left as undeciphered by the Rundata venture.

Runestone U 518 (area) is in the RAK style and is raised on the southern side of a piny incline some north-east of the principle working of the estate VÃ¤stra Ledinge. The stone was made known by Richard Dybeck in a few distributions during the 1860s, and at the time it had as of late been decimated and was in a few bits of which the base part was still in the ground. In 1942, the stone was patched and raised once again at the first spot. The stone comprises of dim and coarse rock. 

The runestone was made in memory of three men, of whom two passed on in Greece, while a third one, Freygeirr, kicked the bucket at a discussed area composed as I silu Ã nur. Richard Dybeck proposed that it may either allude to the adjacent home of SkÃ¤llnora or lake Siljan, and Sophus Bugge recognized the area as "Saaremaa north" ("Ãysilu nor"), while Erik Brate considered the area to have been Salo in present-day Finland. The contemporary view, as exhibited in Rundata, gets from a later examination by OtterbjÃ¶rk (1961) who consider it to allude to a sound at the island SelaÃ¶n in MÃ¤laren.

Runestone U 540 (area) is in the Urnes (Pr4) style and it is ascribed to the runemaster Ãsmund KÃ¥resson. It is mounted with iron toward the northern mass of the congregation of Husby-Sjuhundra, however when the stone was first recorded by Johannes Bureus in 1638 he noticed that it was utilized as a limit in the chamber of the congregation. It was as yet utilized as a limit when Richard Dybeck visited it in 1871, and he masterminded with the goal that the whole engraving was made obvious so as to make a cast duplicate. In 1887, the parishioners chose to separate both U 540 and U 541 from the congregation and with money related assistance from the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities the stones were expelled and joined outside the northern divider. The stone is of red sandstone and it is high and wide. A few pieces of the stone and its engraving have been lost, and it is worn out because of its previous use as a limit. 

A hypothesis, proposed by Germanist F. A. Braun (1910), which depends on the runestones runestone , U 540, SÃ¶ 179 and SÃ¶ 279, holds the lamenting Ingvar to be a similar individual as Ingvar the Far-Traveled, the child of the Swedish ruler Emund the Old. Braun takes note of that the stones were raised at a Husby, an illustrious living arrangement, and the names "EirÃ­kr" (Eric) and "HÃ¡kon" were fairly uncommon in Sweden, yet known from the regal line. Ãnundr would be Anund GÃ¥rdske, who was brought up in Russia, while EirÃ­kr would be one of the two actors named Eric, and HÃ¡kon would be HÃ¥kan the Red. These distinguishing pieces of proof of the three men EirÃ­kr, HÃ¡kon and Ingvarr additionally show up in the reference work "Nordiskt runnamnslexikon" (2002), where it includes that EirÃ­kr is likewise considered to show up on the HillersjÃ¶ stone and runestone U 20. It additionally recognizes HÃ¡kon with the person who appointed the runestones Ãg 162 and Ãg Fv1970;310.

Runestone U 792 (area) is in the Fp style and it is credited to the runemaster Balli. The stone is in dark rock and it gauges in stature and in width. It was initially raised together with a second runestone, with one on each side of the Eriksgata where the street passed a portage, c. west of where the homestead Ulunda is today. The Eriksgata was the way that recently chosen Swedish lords passed when they visited the nation so as to be acknowledged by the neighborhood congregations. The stone was first archived by Johannes Bureus in the seventeenth century, and later around the same time by Johan PeringskiÃ¶ld, who believed it to be an amazing stone brought up in memory of a frivolous lord, or war boss, in agnostic occasions. At the point when Richard Dybeck visited the stone, in 1863, it was leaning back significantly, and in 1925, the stone was accounted for to have totally tumbled down at the bank of the stream. It was not until 1946 that the Swedish National Heritage Board organized to have it re-raised. It was brought up in memory of a man (presumably Haursi) by his child, KÃ¡rr, and his brother by marriage. Haursi had come back from Greece a rich man, which left his child beneficiary to a fortune.

Runestone U 922 (area) is in the Pr4 (Urnes) style and it gauges in tallness and in width. It is covered up inside the floor in Uppsala Cathedral, beside the tomb of lord Gustav Vasa of Sweden. Its reality was first archived by Johannes Bureus in 1594, and in 1666, Johannes Schefferus remarked on the stone as one of numerous runestones that had been seen as rapscallion and which had along these lines been utilized as development material for the house of God. Schefferus considered U 922 to be the most remarkable one of these stones and he lamented that parts were under the column and that it could in this way not be perused altogether. In 1675, Olof Verelius found that it had been made in memory of a voyager to Greece, yet at the same time the French explorer Aubrey de la Motraye kept in touch with home, in 1712, that he had been educated that it had been made in memory of an explorer to Jerusalem. The last researcher to report that the engraving was obvious was Olof Celsius in 1729, and it gives the idea that it was before long secured by another layer of floor. In 1950, educator Elias WessÃ©n and the region caretaker of ancient pieces mentioned that it be expelled for better investigation together with three different runestones, however the solicitation was dismissed by the Royal Board of Construction (KBS) due to wellbeing concerns. 

ÃgulbjÃ¶rn additionally shows up on a second runestone in Uppsala Cathedral, U 925, made by ÃgulbjÃ¶rn in memory of his child GagÊ who passed on "in the South", with "South" likely alluding to the Byzantine Empire.

Runestone U 956 (area) was cut by the runemaster Ãsmund KÃ¥resson in runestone style Pr3 or Urnes style. It is one of two enduring engravings that demonstrate Ãsmund's patronym, the other being GS 11 in JÃ¤rvsta. This stone is raised at Vedyxa close Uppsala, about east of the intersection of the way to LÃ¶vsta and the nation street among Uppsala and Funbo. The stone is in dark rock and it has an unordinary shape with two level surfaces and an unfeeling point between them. The engraving is high, of which the upper part is and the lower part , and the width is . 

U 956 was first archived by Johannes Haquini Rhezelius (d. 1666), and later by Johan PeringskiÃ¶ld (1710), who remarked that the engraving was neat regardless of the stone having been part in two sections. In contrast to present day researchers, PeringskiÃ¶ld associated this stone, similar to the next Greece runestones, to the Gothic wars in south-eastern Europe from the third century and onwards. Olof Celsius visited the stone multiple times, and the last time was in 1726 together with his nephew Anders Celsius. Olof Celsius noticed that PeringskiÃ¶ld had been off-base and that the stone was unblemished, despite the fact that it gives an impression of being part in two, and a similar perception was made by Richard Dybeck in 1866.

Runestone U 1016 (area) is in light dark and coarse stone, and it is high and wide. The stone stands in a lush field west of the way to the town Fjuckby, of the intersection, and about south-south-east of the ranch Fjuckby. The primary researcher to remark on the stone was Johannes Bureus, who visited the stone on June 19, 1638. A few different researchers would visit the stone amid the next hundreds of years, for example, Rhezelius in 1667, PeringskiÃ¶ld in 1694, and Olof Celsius in 1726 and in 1738. In 1864, Richard Dybeck noticed that the runestone was one of a few in the region that had been raised again amid the late spring. 

Portions of the ornamentation have been lost due to chipping, which presumably occurred amid the seventeenth century, however the engraving is flawless. The craftsmanship on the runestone has probably been grouped under style Pr2, yet WessÃ©n and Jansson (1953â 1958) remark that the ornamentation is viewed as uncommon and it is not quite the same as that on most different runestones in the region. Different stones in a similar style are the Vang stone and the Alstad stone in Norway, and U 1146 in Sweden. The style was more qualified for wood and metal and all things considered, just couple of runemasters at any point attempted to apply it on stone. 

Comparable the engraving on U 1011, this runic engraving utilizes the expression "stÃ½rimaÃ°r" as a title that is interpreted as "skipper". Different runestones utilize this term clearly to depict filling in as a steersman on a ship. There have been a few unique understandings of parts of the engraving, however the accompanying two elucidations show up in "Rundata" (2008):

Runestone U 1087 (previous area) was a strangely substantial and forcing runestone in the Urnes (Pr4) style, yet it has vanished. Before it was lost, it was contemplated and depicted by a few researchers, for example, Bureus, Rhezelius, PeringskiÃ¶ld and finally by Olof Celsius in 1726. 

PeringskiÃ¶ld remarked that the stone was leaning back in reverse in a jump garden at the eastern homestead of LÃ¶vsta, which was later affirmed by Celius in 1726. Stolpe attempted to discover it, yet noted in 1869 that the landowner knew about the runestone, yet that the last had announced it to be totally canvassed in soil, and in 1951, a runologist endeavored to find the runestone yet fizzled. 

The engraving had an abnormal spotted k-rune in girkium ("Greece") which it shared for all intents and purpose with U 922, above, however the main trouble that has emerged in the translation of the runes is the arrangement onar. Rhezelius read it as a name, "Onarius", which would have had a place with a third child, while Verelius, PeringskiÃ¶ld, Dijkman and Celsius deciphered it as the pronoun "annarr" signifying "the other" and alluding to Ãtryggr, an understanding bolstered by WessÃ©n and Jansson (1953â 1958), and by Rundata (see underneath).

There are seven runestones in SÃ¶dermanland that relate of voyages to Greece. Two of them seem to make reference to administrators of the Varangian Guard and a second talks of a thegn, a high positioning warrior, who battled and passed on together with Greeks. 

The runestone SÃ¶ Fv1954;20 (area) was found in 1952 around west-south-west of Nolinge estate amid the furrowing of a field, together with a uninscribed stone. It was thus part of a twin landmark and they had been situated about 2â 3 m separated on the two sides of a locally imperative street, where they had denoted a passage. The two stones had lost their upper parts and the present tallness of the runestone is (of which is over the ground) and it is wide. It is delegated being cut in runestone style Fp.

Runestone SÃ¶ 82 (area) is in rock, and it quantifies in tallness and it is wide. It was in the past under a wooden edge inside Tumbo church, and the upper part was covered up under the mass of the chamber. A large portion of the engraving and the fine art have been devastated, yet what remains is delegated either style Fp or Pr1 (Ringerike style). The engraving somewhat comprises of figure runes. 

The stone was brought by VÃ©steinn up in memory of his sibling Freysteinn who passed on in Greece, and as per Omeljan Pritsak, Freysteinn was the authority of an entourage. The wolf-monster picture in the focal point of SÃ¶ 82 contacts the engraving at the name Freysteinn and has its jaws at the word for "was dead" or "passed on." Since one known kenning in Old Norse verse for being executed in fight was that the "wolf was encouraged," the mix of the content and symbolism would prompt the end that Freysteinn had kicked the bucket fighting in Greece. 

In spite of the fact that the dedication stone picture incorporates a Christian cross, the two individual names in the engraving both allude to Norse agnosticism. Ãorsteinn incorporates as a name component the god Thor and signifies "Thor's stone," while VÃ©steinn incorporates "vÃ©", a sanctuary or asylum, and when utilized in an individual name signifies "sacred," giving the name the signifying "heavenly stone."

Runestone SÃ¶ 85 (area) is a runestone in style KB that measures in tallness. The rock stone was found at a little creek, however in 1835 the runestone was devastated. A few pieces were conveyed to Munkhammar and MÃ¤lhammar where they were utilized for the development of chimneys. were conveyed to VÃ¤sterby in 1855 so as to be secured by a fence, yet when an insightful enquiry occurred in 1897, just four pieces remained. A relationship of neighborhood curators orchestrated with the goal that the four outstanding parts could be reassembled at VÃ¤sterby.

Runestone SÃ¶ 163 (area) is in the style Fp and it is of dark gneiss estimating in tallness and in width. The runestone was first reported amid the national scan for notable landmarks in 1667â 84 and PeringskiÃ¶ld noticed that it was close to the town of Snesta among Ryckesta and the interstate. In 1820, the stone was accounted for to be seriously harmed and generally covered up in the ground because of its being in favor of a neighborhood street. George Stephens revealed in 1857 that its previous position had been on a pushcart at a little way close Ryckesta, however that it had been moved in 1830 to the road of the house TÃ¤ckhammar and reerected on a lush slant exactly 14 paces from the passage to the expressway. 

The man who raised the stone is named with the runes Ã¾ruÊikr and the name was distinguished as "ÃrÃ½rÃ­kr" by Sophus Bugge who recognized the primary component of the name as the thing "Ã¾rÃ½Ã°-" that would be gotten from a "*Ã¾rÅ«Ã°i-" and relate to Old English "Ã¾rÃ½Ã°u" ("control", "constrain"). The Old English structure is related with the Old Icelandic component "Ã¾rÃºÃ°-" ("constrain") which shows up in a few Old Norse words regarding the Norse god Thor. This examination was acknowledged by Brate and WessÃ©n despite the fact that they noticed that the name contains Ê rather than the normal r, while the Rundata corpus gives the somewhat unique structure "ÃryÃ°rÃ­kr". 

The stone was brought up in memory of two children, one of whom went to Greece where he "isolated up gold", an articulation that additionally shows up on runestone SÃ¶ 165, beneath. It can either imply that he was in charge of conveying installment to the individuals from the Varangian Guard or that he partook in the division of plunder. DÃ¼wel has recommended that the articulation is the eastern course likeness "gjaldi skifti" ("partitioned installment") which shows up in the close-by stone SÃ¶ 166 that discussions of installments to Vikings in England (see likewise U 194, U 241 and U 344). Assuming this is the case, the articulation could imply that the man who was remembered had gotten installment.

Runestone SÃ¶ 165 (area) is likely sorted as being in the RAK style. It is of dark rock and is tall and wide. The runestone was first reported amid the national look for memorable landmarks (1667â 81) and after that it was raised close to various raised stones. Later the runestone was moved and raised adjacent to SÃ¶ 166 at a jettison southwest of Grinda ranch. 

It was raised by a mother, GuÃ°run, in memory of her child, HeÃ°inn. Like runestone SÃ¶ 163, it likewise reports that the man concerned went to Greece and "isolated up gold" which may allude to dispersing installment to individuals from the Varangian monitor, the division of plunder or having gotten installment (look at SÃ¶ 163, above). The engraving itself is a sonnet in fornyrÃ°islag.

Runestone SÃ¶ 170 in dim rock is raised north of the previous street in NÃ¤lberga (area), and the stone is tall and wide. Its style is probably given as RAK and a portion of the runes are figure runes as branch runes. The runic content tells that a man named BÃ¡ulfr passed on with the Greeks at an area that has not been plainly recognized through a few investigations of the figure runes. LÃ¤ffler (1907) proposed that the area is to be perused "ÎÏá½¡Î¼Î·" which was the name of a town in Thessaly and a fortification in Messenia, likewise called "Îá½¡Î¼Î·". BÃ¡ulfr is portrayed as being "Ã¾rÃ³ttar Ã¾egn" or a thegn of solidarity. The term thegn portrays a class of retainer. The expression "Ã¾rÃ³ttar Ã¾egn" is utilized on six different runestones, SÃ¶ 90 in LÃ¶vhulta, SÃ¶ 112 in Kolunda, SÃ¶ 151 in LÃ¶vsund, and SÃ¶ 158 in Ãsterberga, and, in its plural structure at SÃ¶ 367 in SlÃ¤bro and SÃ¶ Fv1948;295 in PrÃ¤stgÃ¥rden. 

Omeljan Pritsak (1981) remarks that among the individuals who raised the remembrance, the most youthful child GuÃ°vÃ©r would ascend to turn into the officer of the Varangian Guard in the mid-eleventh century, as appeared in a second notice of GuÃ°vÃ©r on the runestone SÃ¶ 217. That stone was brought up in memory of one of the individuals from GuÃ°vÃ©r's entourage.

Runestone SÃ¶ 345 (area) was first archived amid the national look for memorable landmarks in 1667, and it was then utilized as a doorstep to the patio of YtterjÃ¤rna church. It had most likely been utilized for this reason amid an impressive timeframe, in light of the fact that as per an illustration that was made a couple of years after the fact, it was very worn out. In 1830 a congregation amendment noticed that it was in a demolished state thus worn that just a couple of runes stayed perceptible, and when Hermelin later delineated the stone, he noticed that the stone had been broken in two pieces. In 1896, the runologist Erik Brate visited the stone and found that one of the pieces had vanished and that the main outstanding part was leaning back on the congregation divider. The rest of the piece estimated and . The stone has from that point forward been reassembled and raised on the graveyard.

English interpretation (parts B and C are presumably not part of the landmark and are not deciphered): 

In ÃstergÃ¶tland, there are two runestones that notice Greece. One, the striking HÃ¶gby Runestone, depicts the passings of a few siblings in various pieces of Europe. 

The HÃ¶gby runestone (area) is in Ringerike (Pr1) style, and the rosy rock stone measures in tallness and in width. It was once in the past embedded into the external mass of HÃ¶gby church with the cross side (An) outwards. The congregation was annihilated in 1874, and after that side B of the engraving was found. The stone was raised once more on the burial ground of the previous church. 

The runestone recognizes Ãzurr, one of the first Varangians who is known to have kicked the bucket in the administration of the Byzantine Emperor, and he is evaluated to have passed on around 1010, or in the late tenth century. He was one of the children of the "great man" Gulli, and the runestone portrays a circumstance that may have been normal for Scandinavian families right now: the stone was made on the requests of Ãzur's niece, ÃorgerÃ°r, in memory of her uncles who were all dead. 

ÃorgerÃ°r presumably had the stone made when she had discovered that Ãzurr, the remainder of her uncles, had passed on in Greece, and she likely did this to guarantee her privilege of legacy. The engraving on the turn around side of the stone, relating how her different uncles kicked the bucket, is in fornyrÃ°islag. 

Her uncle Ãsmundr most likely kicked the bucket in the Battle of FÃ½risvellir, during the 980s, and it was presumably along the edge of lord Eric the Victorious. Ãzurr had gone into the administration of an all the more dominant master and passed on for the Byzantine Emperor. Halfdan may have passed on either on Bornholm or in a holmgang, though where KÃ¡ri kicked the bucket stays questionable. The no doubt elucidation might be that he passed on Od, the old name for the north-western cape of Zealand, however it is likewise conceivable that it was at Dundee in Scotland. BÃºi's area of death isn't given, however Larsson (2002) remarks that it was most likely in a way that was not considered as heavenly as those of his siblings.

Runestone Ãg 94 (area) in the style Ringerike (Pr1), is in ruddy stone and it raised on the previous burial ground of Harstad church. The stone is high and wide at its base. The toponym "HaÃ°istaÃ°ir", which is referenced in the engraving, alludes to present day Haddestad in the region, and it additionally seems to specify Greece as the area where the perished kicked the bucket, and it was likely as an individual from the Varangian monitor. Also, the last piece of the engraving that makes reference to the area of his demise is most likely a lyric in fornyrÃ°islag.

In VÃ¤stergÃ¶tland, there are five runestones that recount eastern voyages yet just a single of them specifies Greece. 

Runestone Vg 178 (area) in style Pr1 used to be outside the congregation of KÃ¶laby in the graveyard, about ten meters north-north-west of the steeple. The stone comprises of chipping gneiss estimating in stature and in width. 

The most established comment of the stone is in a congregation stock from 1829, and it says that the stone was unintelligible. LjungstrÃ¶m archived in 1861 that it was in the stone fence with the engraving confronting the graveyard. At the point when Djurklou visited the stone in 1869, it was still in a similar spot. Djurklou believed its situation to be unhelpful on the grounds that a piece of the runic band was covered in the dirt, so he instructed a good rancher to choose a gathering of men and expel the stone from the divider. Whenever Djurklou visited the area, he found the stone brought up in the burial ground.

There was just a single rune stone in SmÃ¥land that referenced Greece (see Sm 46, beneath). 

Runestone Sm 46 (area) was in the style RAK and it was high and wide. 

The stone was at that point in a destroyed state when Rogberg portrayed the stone in 1763. Rogberg noticed that it had been utilized as a scaffold over a rivulet and as a result of this the runes had been worn out so much that a large portion of them were basically indecipherable, an explanation that is repudiated by later delineations. Since the runestone had passed unnoticed by the runologists of the seventeenth century, all things considered, it was utilized as an extension. In an explorer's diary written in 1792 by Hilfeling, the base piece of the stone is delineated out of the blue, however the craftsman does not seem to have understood that the two sections had a place together. In 1822, Liljegren touched base to portray it. An enduring yet unsigned attracting is credited to Liljegren ("see representation"). In 1922, the runologist Kinander gained from a nearby rancher that somewhere in the range of 40 years sooner, the runestone had been seen walled into a scaffold that was a piece of the nation street, and the engraving had been upwards. Somebody had chosen to expel the runestone from the extension and put it alongside the street. Kinander needed to see the stone and was appeared huge worn out stone in the patio nursery of Eriksstad. Be that as it may, as indicated by Kinander it was impractical to locate any outstanding runes on what should be the runestone.

Just a single runestone referencing the Byzantine Empire has been found on Gotland. This might be expected both to the way that couple of rune stones were brought on Gotland up for picture stones, just as to the way that the Gotlanders managed principally in exchange, paying a yearly tribute to the Swedes for military insurance. 

G 216 (unique area) is a long, wide and thick honing stone with a runic engraving that was found in 1940. It was found by a laborer at a profundity of while he burrowed a pole for a phone wire in a field at Timans in Roma. It is currently at the historical center Gotlands fornsal with stock number C 9181. It has been dated to the late eleventh century, and despite the fact that the translation of its message is unsure, researchers have commonly acknowledged von Friesen's investigation that it honors the movements of two Gotlanders to Greece, Jerusalem, Iceland and the Muslim world ("Serkland"). 

The engraving caused a buzz as it makes reference to four far off nations that were the objectives of brave Scandinavian campaigns amid the Viking Age, yet it likewise mixed a few questions as to its credibility. Be that as it may, exhaustive geographical and runological examinations dispersed any questions as to its authentic nature. The stone had a similar patina as other Viking Age stones on the entirety of its surfaces and carvings, and also it has the typical r-rune with an open side stroke, something which is normally ignored by forgerers. In addition, v Friesen remarked that there could be no master on Old Swedish that made a fraud while he effectively composed krikiaÊ as all reference books of the time erroneously informed that the structure was "grikir". 

Jansson, WessÃ©n and SvÃ¤rdstrÃ¶m (1978) remark that the individual name that is viewed as most fascinating by researchers is "Ormika", which is generally just known from the "Gutasaga", where it was the name of a free rancher who was absolved by the Norwegian ruler Saint Olaf in 1029. The main component "ormr" ("snake") is outstanding from the Old Norse naming custom, yet the second component is the West Germanic minute - "ikan", and the absence of the last "- n" recommends an acquiring from Anglo-Saxon or Old Frisian, in spite of the fact that the name is unattested in the West Germanic region. The runologists value the presence of the nominative structure "GrikkiaÊ" ("Greece") as it is generally unattested while other case shapes are found on various runestones. The spot name Jerusalem shows up in the Old Gutnish structure iaursaliÊ while the western-most tongue of Old Norse, Old Icelandic, has "JÃ³rsalir", and both speak to a Scandinavian people etymological rendering where the main component is translated as the name component "jÃ³r-" (from a more seasoned *"eburaz" signifying "pig"). The engraving likewise demonstrates the main runic appearance of the name of Iceland, while there are five other runic engravings in Sweden that notice Serkland.
