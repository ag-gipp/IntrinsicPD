UConn spoke to the Big East Conference (Big East) in the diversion; Buffalo entered as the Mid-American Conference (MAC) champion. 

Connecticut was chosen as a member in the 2009 International Bowl following a 7â 5 standard season where they won their initial five recreations, just to lose five of their last seven challenges. Confronting the Huskies were the Buffalo Bulls with an ordinary season record of 8â 5, featured by an annoyed success over then-No.Â 12 and undefeated Ball State in the 2008 MAC Championship Game. Pre-diversion media inclusion concentrated on the inheritance of the 1958 Buffalo Bulls, the primary group from the college to be welcome to a bowl amusement. At the point when informed that the two African-American individuals from the group would not be permitted to play in view of isolation, the group chose to decline the bowl offer. Wild ox would not play in a bowl until this diversion, 50Â years later. 

The diversion started at 12:00Â PM EST. Connecticut, driven by running back Donald Brown's 208Â yards surging, overwhelmed the main half measurably, yet ended up down 20â 10 halfway during that time quarter since they submitted six bungles, five of which were recuperated by Buffalo. UConn would close the hole to 20â 17 by halftime, and lead the pack for good late in the second from last quarter off a 4-yard touchdown go from quarterback Tyler Lorenzen to tight end Steve Brouse. The Connecticut triumph was fixed when, late in the final quarter, Buffalo quarterback Drew Willy tossed a pass that was captured by UConn wellbeing Dahna Deleston and returned 100Â yards for a touchdown. 

UConn junior running back Donald Brown was named player of the amusement. He completed with 261Â rushing yards and oneÂ touchdown; his 2,083Â rushingÂ yards for the 2008 season was best in the NCAA. Following the diversion, Brown pronounced his qualification for the 2009 NFL Draft; he would turn into the main Connecticut player at any point drafted in the first round. Three other UConn players were drafted in the second round. 

The International Bowl had contracts with the Big East and Mid-American Conferences that enabled them to choose one group from every gathering to take part in their yearly amusement. By temperance of being the Big East boss Cincinnati was granted a programmed Bowl Championship Series compartment; they would play in the 2009 Orange Bowl. The Gator Bowl and Sun Bowl shared the second pick of Big East groups; after the Gator Bowl picked to choose Big 12 part Nebraska and the Sun Bowl discovered that they would not be permitted to choose Notre Dame, Pittsburgh got the Sun Bowl welcome. The Meineke Car Care Bowl, which had the third choice, picked West Virginia. The fourth, fifth, and 6th choices of Big East groups had a place aggregately with the International Bowl, PapaJohns.com Bowl, and St. Petersburg Bowl, which, in counsel with the Big East, chose which schools were the best fit for each bowl. There were three residual bowl-qualified Big East groups: Connecticut, Rutgers, and South Florida. The past season, Rutgers had played in the International Bowl and South Florida had showed up in the PapaJohns.com Bowl; bowls when all is said in done abhorrence welcoming a similar group in sequential years, on the hypothesis that fans are less inclined to need to head out to a similar goal they were at the prior year. Also, the St. Petersburg Bowl, in its debut year, looked to have neighborhood group South Florida play in their amusement to drive nearby participation. Hence, the groups were distributed among the dishes as pursues: South Florida to the St. Petersburg Bowl, Rutgers to the PapaJohns.com Bowl, and Connecticut to the International Bowl. On December 7, 2008, UConn formally acknowledged the bowl welcome, the third in their history. 

Bison acknowledged a solicitation to the International Bowl following their triumph over then-undefeated Ball State in the 2008 MAC Championship Game. Despite the fact that in past years the MAC champion had been welcome to the Motor City Bowl, Buffalo liked to go to the International Bowl because of Toronto being nearer to the school than Detroit, the home of the Motor City Bowl. The diversion denoted the main bowl for the Bulls after their first MAC Championship since moving to Division I-An and joining the MAC in 1999. 

The Bulls and Huskies had been visit adversaries amid the earlier decade as the two projects made the change from Division I-AA to Division I-A. The two groups played each other in six back to back seasons from 1999 to 2005, with Connecticut winning five of the six substance. The 2005 diversion, won by UConn 38â 0, was the latest gathering between the two groups. By and large, the Huskies and Bulls had played each other multiple times since their first gathering in 1939, with Connecticut holding a 12â 4 advantage in the untouched arrangement. Preceding the 2008 season, Buffalo and UConn had marked an agreement to play a four-amusement, home-and-home arrangement starting in 2010. 

Entering 2008, the Bulls looked to work off of their 2007 season, where they shared the MAC East title yet did not show up in the title amusement because of a 31â 28 misfortune to individual division co-champion Miami (Ohio). Their 5â 7 last record, while not sufficient to meet all requirements for a bowl diversion, was as yet the best by a Buffalo group since they had climbed to Division I-An out of 1999. With 10 starters returning on offense and eight on protection, the 2008 group was anticipated to be maybe the most skilled group in Bulls history; be that as it may, because of their difficult calendar, their last record was anticipated to be no superior to 3â 9. 

Wild ox opened the season more grounded than anticipated, with a predominant home success over the University of Texas-El Paso (UTEP), 42â 17. This was trailed by a closer-than-anticipated misfortune at intensely supported Pittsburgh, 27â 16. Bison's third amusement and meeting opener, versus Temple, was a forward and backward challenge that came down to the last play of the diversion. Keeping the amusement inside seven for the initial seventy five percent, the Bulls originally led the pack with 2:27 left in the final quarter, on a 25-yard field objective by A.J. Principe. Sanctuary reacted with a nine-play, 74-yard drive topped by a 11-yard touchdown get by wide recipient Bruce Francis, his second score of the amusement, to take a 28â 24 lead with just 38Â seconds remaining. Taking over at their own 40-yard line after the kickoff left limits, the Bulls drove down the field, scoring the diversion winning touchdown on a 35-yard franticness hurl from Drew Willy to wide collector Naaman Roosevelt with no time staying on the clock. Wild ox's record following the very late success was 2â 1, denoting the first run through since 1969 that the Bulls had a record more than .500 past Week 1 as a Division I-A group. The last time the Bulls had begun a season 2â 1 was 1998, while they were as yet played in Division I-AA. 

The Bulls continued to lose their next three diversions. Wild ox was unfit to stay aware of No.Â 5-positioned Missouri, losing 42â 21 of every a diversion that Missouri saw as a tuneup for their later season. In the following challenge, against MAC adversary Central Michigan, down nineÂ points with under threeÂ minutes left Buffalo scored on a 65-yard go to James Starks, recouped an onside kick to hold ownership, and endeavored an amusement winning field objectiveâyet A.J. Principe's 46-yard kick hit the correct goalpost to give Central Michigan the triumph.

Against Army, Buffalo turned around the aftereffect of the Western Michigan amusement, returning from a two-touchdown shortfall to win in additional time. Dealing with gathering rivals Ohio and Miami (Ohio) without any difficulty, Buffalo proceeded with meeting play by beating Akron in a four-hour, four-extra time slugfest, 43â 40, in Akron's last football match-up at the Rubber Bowl. In their next amusement, against Bowling Green, the Bulls ended up down 21â 0 halfway through the second from last quarter, yet at the same time figured out how to return for their third extra time win of the period. With the success, Buffalo secured the MAC East title and guaranteed that they would have their first winning normal season since moving to Division I-A; the last ordinary season diversion, a 24â 21 misfortune to Kent State, was just a convention. The Bulls completed the ordinary season with a general record of 7â 5, 5â 3 inside the meeting. 

Wild ox's adversary in the 2008 MAC Championship Game would be the No.Â 12-positioned Ball State Cardinals, who had gone undefeated in winning the MAC West. Ball State was a two-touchdown most loved entering the diversion; Buffalo in its history was 0â 5 against the Cardinals. The Bulls hit first with a touchdown late in the principal quarter; Ball State reacted with a touchdown and a field objective in the second quarter to take a 10â 7 lead at the half. The two groups exchanged touchdowns right off the bat in the second from last quarter. Calamity at that point struck for Ball State: on two back to back belongings late in the second from last quarter, in the wake of having crashed into the red zone, the Cardinals mishandled the ball. Bison returned both of these bobbles for touchdowns and took a lead they would not surrender. The Bulls won 42â 24, winning their first-since forever MAC Championship just as their first-historically speaking win over a positioned rival in nine endeavors. 

The Huskies entered 2008 looking to demonstrate their prosperity the past season was no fluke. In 2007, Connecticut earned their first Big East co-title, though in the wake of losing to their kindred co-champion, West Virginia, 66â 21. A misfortune to Wake Forest in the 2007 Meineke Car Care Bowlâthe group's second bowl appearance untouchedâgave the Huskies a last 2007 record of 9â 4. In the Big East preseason media survey, UConn was picked to complete sixth generally speaking in the gathering. 

UConn began the season solid, winning their initial five amusements. The Huskies effectively won their first amusement 35â 3 against Division I-Football Championship Subdivision (Division I-FCS) adversary Hofstra. The second diversion, at Temple, was played as the leftovers of Hurricane Hanna hit Philadelphia. UConn won 12â 9 in additional time as Donald Brown kept running for a then-profession high 214Â yards and scored the amusement winning touchdown. Connecticut next retaliated for their misfortune to Virginia from 2007, winning the rematch 45â 10. Baylor was next on the calendar; the Huskies hauled out the success in a forward and backward diversion, 31â 28. Connecticut opened Big East gathering play in their next diversion against Louisville. The diversion was not chosen until UConn linebacker Lawrence Wilson restored a capture attempt for a touchdown with 2:45 left in the final quarter, giving the Huskies a 26â 21 lead they would not give up. This was the second in a row season where Connecticut won their initial five diversions; before 2007, they had not opened a season so effectively since 1995, when they won their initial six straight. Following the diversion, UConn accomplished their sole positioning of the year, showing up at No.Â 24 in the Associated Press (AP) and Harris surveys and No.Â 23 in the Coaches' survey. Be that as it may, beginning quarterback Tyler Lorenzen broke his foot in the Louisville diversion; the Huskies would be compelled to depend on reinforcement Zach Frazer for the following couple of amusements. 

The Huskies were unfit to coordinate their initial achievement in the second 50% of the period, losing five of their next seven amusements. Everything turned out badly for UConn in their amusement at North Carolina, as Frazer was caught multiple times and three Connecticut punts were blocked; North Carolina won in a victory, 38â 12. Against Big East adversary Rutgers, UConn lost 12â 10 as kicker Tony Ciaravino missed three field objectives, incorporating one with 1:09 left in the diversion that hit the correct goalpost. The Huskies skiped back in their next amusement against possible Big East boss Cincinnati, winning in a victory 40â 16. While not positioned in any of the surveys, after the success Connecticut got itself No.Â 25 in the BCS standings. The Huskies would instantly surrender that respect, losing to West Virginia 35â 13 subsequent to driving 10â 0 toward the finish of the primary quarter and 13â 7 at halftime. UConn would win the following week at Big East base inhabitant Syracuse, 39â 14, as Lorenzen came back from his damage. This would turn out to be their last win of the normal season, as the Huskies completed with misfortunes to South Florida (17â 13) and No.Â 23-positioned Pittsburgh (34â 10). Connecticut finished the ordinary season with a record of 7â 5, 3â 4 inside the Big East gathering. 

In the weeks paving the way to the amusement, media inclusion concentrated on the accomplishments of the Buffalo Bulls. Wild ox had been a standout amongst the most ineffective projects in school football from their progress to Division I-An out of 1999 to 2006, amid which they had a total record of 12â 79. In 2008, the Bulls had their first winning season since 1996, won five diversions in succession out of the blue since 1986, beat a positioned group without precedent for program history with their furious triumph over Ball State in the MAC Championship Game, and would show up in school history. The turnaround of the Buffalo program conveyed praise to Bulls head mentor Turner Gill, who had assumed control over the group in 2007. 

Nearly, Connecticut was a bit of hindsight heading into the diversion. Pre-bowl inclusion of UConn concentrated on NCAA hurrying pioneer Donald Brown, who was thinking about prior his senior season to enter the 2009 NFL Draft. Dark colored showed before the amusement that he had chosen to come back to UConn for the 2010 season. 

Following the standard season, theory encompassed whether Turner Gill would leave Buffalo for another school's head instructing position.

Gill wound up marking an agreement augmentation with Buffalo. 

UConn head mentor Randy Edsall, who had been with the Huskies since 1999, was additionally reputed to be a contender for the Syracuse work. Edsall, a Syracuse graduate, denied any intrigue. Hostile facilitator Rob Ambrose acknowledged the head instructing position at Towson, his place of graduation; he would remain to mentor UConn amid the bowl amusement, be that as it may. 

While the 2009 International Bowl denoted the main appearance of the Buffalo Bulls in a bowl diversion, it was not the first run through the school had been welcome to a bowl. Fifty years sooner, the 1958 Buffalo Bulls group completed with a record of 8â 1. They were granted the Lambert Cup, given to the best little school group in the eastern US, and got an offer to play in the 1958 Tangerine Bowl, where they would confront Florida State. There was one trick: the group's African-American playersâbeginning running back Willie Evans and reinforcement protective end Mike Wilsonâwould not be permitted to play. The Tangerine Bowl arena was constrained by the Orlando High School Athletic Association, who disallowed incorporated football match-ups.

Willy, heading into his last diversion as a Buffalo Bull, had just outperformed the 3,000-yard mark in passing on the season, tossing for 25Â touchdowns against just fiveÂ interceptions. Starks, while not seen as a similar gauge of player as UConn's Donald Brown, had kept running for over 1,300Â yards and got 41Â passes for 340Â yards, scoring 16Â touchdowns on the year. Roosevelt was viewed as the top playmaker, going over the 100-yard mark in every one of Buffalo's last fiveÂ games and scoring in any event once in his last seven. 

Particularly contrasted with Buffalo, the UConn offense was incredibly unequal; the Huskies positioned nineteenth in the country in running, averaging 204.6Â yards per amusement, however just 106th in the country in passing, averaging 147.3Â yards per diversion. Connecticut's offense was based on running back Donald Brown. Portrayed as "a definitive workhorse", Brown drove the NCAA in hurrying going into the diversion with 1,822Â yards.

Connecticut was particularly great against the pass; they permitted a normal of just 165Â yards per amusement, seventh-best in the nation. No UConn rival go for more than 259Â yards amid the customary season.
