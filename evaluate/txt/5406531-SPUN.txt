Heinrich BÃ¤r 

Heinrich "Pritzl" BÃ¤r (; 25 May 1913Â â 28 April 1957) was a German Luftwaffe flying pro who served all through World War II in Europe. BÃ¤r flew more than one thousand battle missions, and battled in the Western, Eastern and Mediterranean theaters. On 18 events he endure being shot down, and as indicated by records in the German Federal Archives, he professed to have shot down 228 adversary flying machine and was credited with 208 aeronautical triumphs, around 16 of which were in a Messerschmitt Me 262 stream contender. 

BÃ¤r, a local of Saxony, joined the Reichswehr in 1934 and exchanged to the Luftwaffe in 1935. Serving first as a specialist, at that point as a pilot on transport flying machine, he was casually prepared as a military pilot. He guaranteed his first flying triumph in September 1939 on the French fringe. Before the finish of the Battle of Britain, his count of triumphs had expanded to 17. Exchanged toward the Eastern Front to take an interest in Operation Barbarossa, he immediately gathered further triumphs, an accomplishment that earned him the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords for 90 elevated triumphs in February 1942. 

Amid the rest of World War II, BÃ¤r was credited with 130 other flying triumphs, including 16 while flying one of the principal stream contenders, the MeÂ 262, an accomplishment which would typically have earned him the pined for Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. Hermann GÃ¶ring's own aversion of BÃ¤r, combined with BÃ¤r's disobedient character and absence of military control, denied him of this honor. After World War II, BÃ¤r proceeded with his profession as a pilot. He was murdered in a flying mishap on 28 April 1957 close Braunschweig. 

BÃ¤r was conceived on 25 May 1913 in Sommerfeld close Leipzig in the Kingdom of Saxony, a united condition of the German Empire. His folks were ranchers, and in 1916, his dad was murdered in real life on the Western Front of World War I. BÃ¤r went to the "Volksschule", a joined essential and lower optional school, in Sommerfeld. At first, he anticipated assuming control over the family ranch in Engelsdorf and following graduation went to the agribusiness school in Wurzen. Matured 15, he turned into a lightweight flyer pilot, joining the lightweight plane club on the ""Schwarzer Berg"" (Black Mountain) at Taucha. BÃ¤r then needed to turn into a forester, for everything related with untamed life and backwoods intrigued him. His first sight of a Junkers transport flying machine altered his opinion and persuaded him that he ought to turn into a pilot. As a young person, he had aspirations to turn into a carrier pilot with Deutsche Luft Hansa. He gained the moniker "Pritzl" in view of his fondness for Pritzl sweet treats. 

The Great Depression kept BÃ¤r from picking up a common pilot permit. In 1934, he joined the Reichswehr and was doled out to the 3. "Kompanie" of "Kraftfahrabteilung 4" (third Company of the fourth Motor Vehicle Battalion) as a specialist. He served in this situation until the next year, when he was exchanged to a battle wing of the Luftwaffe. A couple of months after the fact, he was acknowledged for pilot preparing, accepting his vehicle air ship pilot's preparation. From 1 November 1937 to 31 March 1938, BÃ¤r went to the flight school at Oldenburg and was then exchanged to the flight school at Hildesheim. He was exchanged once more, going to the flight school at Ludwigslust where he accomplished his Luftwaffe Advanced Pilot's Certificate ("Erweiterter Luftwaffen-FlugzeugfÃ¼hrerschein"), otherwise called 'C'- Certificate, affirming capability on multi-motor flying machine, on 16 May 1938. BÃ¤r then went to the visually impaired flying school "Blindflugschule" 2 (BFS 2âsecond visually impaired flying school) at Neuburg a der Donau from 7 July to 14 August 1938. He was exchanged to I./"Jagdgeschwader" 135, the center of things to come "Jagdgeschwader" 51 (JGÂ 51), on 1 September 1938, normally flying the Junkers Ju 86. The Squadron Leader ("StaffelkapitÃ¤n") Douglas Pitcairn saw BÃ¤r's flying abilities and endeavored to persuade BÃ¤r to turn into a military pilot. At first BÃ¤r cannot, however after he unlawfully directed some aerobatics in the Ju 86 prompting a motor disappointment, he reluctantly acknowledged and turned into a military pilot. 

Positioned on the outskirt with France, BÃ¤r accomplished his first triumphâa Curtiss P-36 Hawkâon 25 September 1939 amid the Phony War air clashes with the "ArmÃ©e de l'Air" (French flying corps). This earned him the Iron Cross second Class () on 29 September 1939 which was displayed to him by Hugo Sperrle. Amid the Battle of France, he was credited with two progressively ethereal triumphs before including a further 10 amid the Battle of Britain and was granted the Iron Cross first Class () on 6 July 1940. Amid this time, he had a few crisis arrivals in gravely harmed air ship and was shot down over the English Channel on 2 September 1940 by a Spitfire. BÃ¤r was brought to show up before Hermann GÃ¶ring and report on this fight. When GÃ¶ring asked him what he was thinking about while in the water, BÃ¤r quickly answered, "Your discourse, Herr "Reichsmarschall", in which you said that England is never again an island!", suggesting a location that GÃ¶ring had made before the German military pilots. Episodes like this are declaration to his regularly barefaced negligence for more recognizable expert. His straightforwardness regularly landed him stuck in an unfortunate situation with GÃ¶ring. In mid 1941, he was credited with an extra four ethereal triumphs against the Royal Air Force (RAF), conveying his aggregate to 17. 

In June 1941, JGÂ 51 was exchanged East to partake in Operation Barbarossa with 1 "staffel". On the morning of the 22 June, BÃ¤r and his wingman "Oberfeldwebel" Heinrich HÃ¶femeier were escorting a harmed Heinkel He 111 over German lines when they reached 18 Tupolev SB planes from the 39 SBAP ("Skorostnoy Bombardirovohchnyy Aviatsionny Polk"â fast aircraft flying regiment) and 10 SAD ("Smeshannaya Aviatsionnaya Diviziya"â composite avionics regiment). The German pilots assaulted; HÃ¶femeier asserted four, BÃ¤r twoâhowever the previous was injured in the arm. The Germans noticed the weakness of the Soviet airplane which needed self-fixing fuel tanks and had a penchant to blast into blazes. More JGÂ 51 Bf 109s showed up and guaranteed six more. None of the 18 Tupolev SB planes from the 39 SBAP or 10 SAD flying machine returned home. BÃ¤r had accomplished his nineteenth and twentieth triumph. 

JGÂ 51 at the time was a piece of the "Fliegerkorps" II, working in the focal segment of the Eastern Front. BÃ¤r guaranteed five airborne triumphs on 30 June 1941, conveying his aggregate to 22. On this day JGÂ 51 was credited with 113 airborne triumphs altogether, among them their 1,000th ethereal triumphâthe main unit to achieve this figureâand "Oberst" Werner MÃ¶lders, with 82 aeronautical triumphs, outperformed Manfred von Richthofen in number of triumphs. The "Geschwader" recorded 24 separate commitment in a 14-hour time frame and lost five Bf 109s. BÃ¤r's rivals included Ilyushin DB-3 aircraft from the 42nd and 52nd DBA ("Dal'me-Bombardirovochnaya Aviatsiya"â long range flight plane regiment). Five Tupolev TB-3s from the third TBAP were likewise guaranteed. 

Inside about fourteen days of battle against the Soviet Air Force, BÃ¤r's count rose to 27, which earned him the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross () on 2 July, trailed by his advancement to "Oberleutnant" on 1 August 1941. On 5 July, BÃ¤r or MÃ¶lders may likewise have shot down the Soviet contender pro "Podpolkovnik" (Lieutenant Colonel) Stepan Suprun from the 401 IAP ("Istrebitel'nyy Aviatsionyy Polk"â warrior avionics regiment) and holder of the Hero of the Soviet Union. BÃ¤r represented a Petlyakov Pe-2 on 23 July. Three were lost from the 411 BAP ("Bombardirovochnyy Aviatsionyy Polk"â plane aeronautics regiment) working under the OSNAZ ("Osoboye Naznachenie"â Special reason unit or team). German pilots submitted three cases. On 9 August a SB plane was asserted from an arrangement of eight having a place with the 57 BAP's third "Eskadrilya"â five Soviet flying machine were shot down. BÃ¤r had accomplished his 55th triumph. 

On 14 August, he was granted the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves () for 60 triumphs, and on 30 August he turned into an "expert in-a-day" by shooting down six Soviet air ship. On 31 August, BÃ¤r was shot somewhere near an Ilyushin Il-2 some behind Soviet lines, close Novgorod-Seversky. He endured wounds to his back and feet while ransoming. BÃ¤r sidestepped Soviet watches which raced to the accident site. BÃ¤r stayed sequestered from everything through to the next night. He turned his calfskin coat back to front and disposed of his flying boots to introduce himself as a Russian worker. Vanity kept him from discarding the Knight's Cross and Oak Leaves and he shrouded the things. BÃ¤r in the end made it to German lines yet irritated his wounds and went through two months in emergency clinic. 

BÃ¤r was elevated to "Hauptmann" in late 1941 and designated Squadron Leader of 12./JGÂ 51 in mid 1942. By late 1941, after MÃ¶lders (115), LÃ¼tzow (100), Galland (96) and Gollob (85), BÃ¤r's 80 set him among the main pilots of the war. His long-lasting wingman at the time was Heinrich Hoffmann. From January he was named "Gruppenkommandeur" (Group Commander) of IV "Gruppe". As of now JGÂ 51 was just the second of two warrior bunches that kept on working the Bf 109E in the winter, 1941. He got the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords () on 16 February as his count rose to 90. This accomplishment was referenced in the day by day "Wehrmachtbericht" purposeful publicity notice on 12 February 1942, his first of three references over the span of the war. After three months he was referenced once more. 

On 11 May, BÃ¤r was exchanged from IV./JGÂ 51 on the Moscow front to assume responsibility for I. "Gruppe" of Gordon Gollob's "Jagdgeschwader" 77 (JGÂ 77) flying wing. BÃ¤r supplanted Herbert Ihlefeld who had been exchanged. JGÂ 77 was entrusted with supporting the hard battling in the Crimean Campaign over the Kerch Strait on the Crimean Peninsula. Driven by the flying pros ("Experten") Gollob and BÃ¤r, JGÂ 77 assumed control over the air space above Kerch-Taman as Gollob and BÃ¤r shot down two and three LaGG-3s individually, raising BÃ¤r's triumph aggregate to 93. Shared ill will between the two men, Gollob, a slave driver professional Nazi, and BÃ¤r, an enemy of tyrant, guaranteed a serious contention. On 19 May 1942, BÃ¤r guaranteed five further ethereal triumphsâincluding a Polikarpov R-5 toward the beginning of the day and four Polikarpov I-16s in a single evening mission: his triumph absolute presently remained at 103. He was the ninth Luftwaffe pilot to accomplish the century mark. That equivalent day, Inspector of Fighters ("General der Jagdflieger") Adolf Galland touched base to investigate BÃ¤r's I./JGÂ 77 and JGÂ 77 outperformed 2,000 triumphs. This flying accomplishment earned BÃ¤r a second notice in the day by day "Wehrmachtbericht" on 20 May 1942. 

In June 1942, JGÂ 77 was moved to the Mediterranean theater and partook noticeable all around fights over Malta before migrating to Tunisia and taking part in the North African Campaign. On 13 October 1942 he represented three Spitfire warriors from 185 and 1345 Squadron close to the Sicilian coast. I./JGÂ 77 before long exchanged to North Africa and partook in the Tunisian Campaign. 

On 1 January 1943 BÃ¤r submitted one of two cases against 12 Curtiss P-40 Warhawks of 3 Squadron RAAF. Flying Officer Ritchie and Sergeant Roediger were lost however BÃ¤r did not get credit. BÃ¤r guaranteed two B-25 Mitchell aircraft and three P-40s on 14 January which don't seem to have been credited. Two cases for P-40s demolished on the 18 January were additionally not allowed. 

On 25 January 1943, BÃ¤r guaranteed two Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk/Warhawk warriors, taking his aggregate to 149 ethereal triumphs. The Allied units included were 112Â SqnÂ RAF, 450Â SqnÂ RAAF, 65th FS,Â USAAF and 66th FS,Â USAAF. (A South African aircraft squadron, 21 Squadron SAAF, was additionally apparently included.) The Germans guaranteed 10 P-40s. 450 and 112 Squadrons lost one each while the 65th Squadron lost three and the 66th two. After BÃ¤r accomplished his 149th aeronautical triumph, General Hans-JÃ¼rgen von Arnim submitted him for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (). "Reichsmarschall" Hermann GÃ¶ring overlooked this solicitation, denying BÃ¤r the "Precious stones". The purpose behind this remaining parts dubious, yet it is trusted that GÃ¶ring loathed BÃ¤r for his defiant character and solid Saxon tongue, which GÃ¶ring was known to hate. On 27 January 1943, BÃ¤r outperformed the 150 aeronautical triumph mark. BÃ¤r's adversaries were most likely USAAF P-40s and P-39 Airacobras from the 33rd and 81st Fighter Group. 

On 4 February BÃ¤r drove I. "Gruppe" enthusiastically against Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft from the 97th and 301st Bomb Group and their Lockheed P-38 Lightning escorts from the first Fighter Group. BÃ¤r asserted one B-17. On 15 February BÃ¤r asserted two USAAF Spitfires. The American pilots were perhaps Lieutenant Joe Reed and H. E Huntingdon from the 31st Fighter Group. After an uncredited guarantee on 24 February over a P-40 BÃ¤r represented five on two days after the fact. German warrior units guaranteed 13 against a genuine 14 (conceivable 15) and a few increasingly harmed. Seven of the British pilots were safe. The next day he was credited with another P-40 in battle with 11 pilots from 4 Squadron SAAF. Records recommend he may have asserted three however was just credited with one. 

BÃ¤r and his I. Gruppe of JGÂ 77 worked from Fatnassa, Tunisia, toward the beginning of March 1943. On first or 2 March, BÃ¤r asserted a Spitfire shot down. At that point at night met Galland, who was making an unexpected visit to I./JGÂ 77. Galland was welcomed by "Real" Joachim MÃ¼ncheberg, who acquainted BÃ¤r with Galland. In this way started a comradeship which outlived World War II. On 6 March 92 Squadron Spitfires gave spread to 1 SAAF Squadron. They were bolstered by 601. BÃ¤r detected their methodology and climbed then jumped onto the British. BÃ¤r represented two SpitfiresâFlight Sergeant Tilston, from 601, was compelled to parcel out and Flying Officer Mahon from the South African unit was slaughtered. 

Over North Africa and the Mediterranean theater, BÃ¤r had expanded his count to 179, in any case, battling a losing fight against regularly expanding Allied air predominance, BÃ¤r lost his battling soul, and endured serious mental and physical fatigue. After a few contentions with JGÂ 77's new Commander Colonel Johannes Steinhoff and Hermann GÃ¶ring, in mid-1943 BÃ¤r was exchanged to France "for weakness before the foe" and downgraded to Squadron Leader. He took over order of an operational preparing unit, "Jagdgruppe SÃ¼d". 

His battle aptitudes were difficult to neglect and consequently BÃ¤r was exchanged to II./"Jagdgeschwader" 1 (JGÂ 1) on 21 January 1944 as a common pilot. He was appointed to 6./JGÂ 1. "Jagdgeschwader" 1 (JGÂ 1) Wing Commander ("Geschwaderkommodore") Colonel Walter Oesau invited him with an update that he had guaranteed "Oberkommando der Luftwaffe" (OKL) GÃ¶ring that BÃ¤r would not be given any order obligations. In spite of the fact that BÃ¤r acknowledged this with amusingness, he later remarked to others that noticeable all around he was the "Kommodore of his own container". 

On 15 March 1944, BÃ¤r, presently a "Noteworthy" and restored from the downgrade, was given order of II./"Jagdgeschwader" 1 (JGÂ 1). This was after the demise of Hauptmann Hermann Segatz on 8 March 1944. JGÂ 1 was entrusted with "Reichsverteidigung" (Defense of the Reich) and outfitted with the Focke Wulf 190 A-7 warrior. Spirit of the gathering took off after his arrangement. He was viewed as the informal pioneer of the gathering and the best officer in the whole "Geschwader". On 11 April 1944, BÃ¤r accomplished his 199th aeronautical triumph over a B-17 close Fallersleben. His 200th airborne triumph, a Consolidated B-24 Liberator, was guaranteed on 22 April joined by his normal wingman Warrant Officer ("Oberfeldwebel") Leo Schuhmacher, who might be granted the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 1 March 1945 as a military pilot in II./JGÂ 1. BÃ¤r had recently arrived at StÃ¶rmede landing strip from an II./JGÂ 1 catch when a smoking United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-24 of the 458th Bombardment Group passed overhead. BÃ¤r and his wingman rapidly got into their air ship and caught the B-24. The plane's heavy armament specialists had just rescued of the flying machine, making it a simple aeronautical triumph. BÃ¤r came back to StÃ¶rmede runway to the congrats of his men. This twofold century triumph earned BÃ¤r his third and last reference in the "Wehrmachtbericht" on 24 April 1944. After Oesau's passing on 11 May 1944, BÃ¤r was made acting Wing Commander of JGÂ 1. In June, he was designated Wing Commander of "Jagdgeschwader" 3 (JGÂ 3) following the passing of Friedrich-Karl MÃ¼ller. Before the finish of 1944, BÃ¤r's score had ascended to 203. 

BÃ¤r's 204th and 205th triumphs, against two Hawker Typhoons, were accomplished on 1 January 1945 amid "Unternehmen Bodenplatte", a Luftwaffe mass assault against Allied landing strips in the Benelux region. The task brought about many flying machine misfortunes on the two sides. BÃ¤r's JGÂ 3 contributed by striking Eindhoven in the Netherlands, shooting down around six RAF contenders and obliterating numerous air ship on the ground. One of BÃ¤r's 'ethereal murders' might not have been airborne. Student of history Norman Franks states both flying machine, from No. 438 Squadron RAF, were navigating when hit. Flight Lieutenant Pete Wilson was injured and later passed on from his wounds after BÃ¤r's strafing assault. The second Typhoon got airborne. Its pilot, Flight Officer Ross Keller was slaughtered. This adaptation of occasions is repudiated by an observer, Pilot Officer 'Bill' Harle, who thought both flying machine were airborne. 

In February, BÃ¤r was exchanged to order the fly warrior preparing unit III./"ErgÃ¤nzungs-Jagdgeschwader" 2 (EJGÂ 2). In March, the unit was outfitted with the Messerschmitt Me 262 warrior and sent into fight. BÃ¤r shot down 13 Allied air ship, huge numbers of them overwhelming planes like the B-17 and the B-24. EJGÂ 2 surrendered Lechfeld for the runway was under consistent assault and was currently undermined by the United States Army. 

On 23 April, BÃ¤r exchanged to the world class "Fly Experten" unit "Jagdverband" 44 (JVÂ 44), driven by Adolf Galland. The next day BÃ¤r informed JVÂ 44 pilots in Galland's nonattendance. The air guards had recognized an approaching American development and BÃ¤r taught the fly pilots on the suitable strategic way to deal with take when the capture attempt was made. Klaus Neumann, Walter Krupinski and GÃ¼nther LÃ¼tzow flew on the mission. LutzÃ¶w was posted lost without a trace and stays missing to date. 

On 26 April, he expected order of the unitafter Galland was injured. BÃ¤r potentially flew his first operational fight with JVÂ 44 on 27 April 1945. Flying the MeÂ 262Â A-1/U5, a six MK 108 gun model, he was joined by "Major" Wilhelm Herget and the non-charged officer NCO ("Unteroffizier") Franz KÃ¶ster when the trio connected with American contenders over Riem; BÃ¤r guaranteed one elevated triumph. While not flying operationally, BÃ¤r invested the majority of his energy giving hurried guidance to the new pilots as yet being appointed to JVÂ 44. With JVÂ 44, he accomplished his last four aeronautical triumphs (3 P-47s and 1 Mosquito) on 28 April, bringing his aggregate to 220. On the whole, he had accomplished 16 triumphs in the MeÂ 262, making him the second best "Fly Expert" of the war, which he completed as a Lieutenant Colonel ("Oberstleutnant"). 

Amid the last days of the Second World War in Europe, Lieutenant General ("Generalleutnant") Adolf Galland endeavored to surrender JVÂ 44 to American powers from his emergency clinic bed. In the meantime Air ("General der Flieger") Karl Koller had requested JVÂ 44 to migrate to Prague and keep battling. BÃ¤r, as a Galland supporter, endeavored to overlook the request. BÃ¤r was additionally constrained to migrate JVÂ 44 when Major General ("Generalmajor") Dietrich Peltz, leader of "IX. Fliegerkorps", and Colonel Hajo Herrmann, administrator of 9. Flieger-Division (J), out of the blue developed at the control room in Maxglan on 2 May 1945. A warmed and vicious question emitted between BÃ¤r, Peltz and Herrmann, seen by Walter Krupinski. He later reviewed that BÃ¤r reacted with "Indeed, sir, yet we are under the direction of "Generalleutnant" Galland, and I will just pursue requests of "Generalleutnant" Galland!"â a last demonstration of defiance that Krupinski accepted could have prompted BÃ¤r being shot for rebellion. 

In the early morning long periods of 4 May 1945, BÃ¤r assembled the pilots of JVÂ 44 for a last preparation. BÃ¤r requested the remaining MeÂ 262 crushed before going into bondage and cross examination by US Intelligence officers of the first Tactical Air Force's Air Prisoner of War Interrogation Unit, based at Heidelberg. 

BÃ¤r did not come back to his home in Sommerfeld after World War II. He settled in Braunschweig, where he proceeded with his vocation in aeronautics, including a lead position for engine controlled trip with the "Deutscher Aero Club". He likewise filled in as an expert and aircraft tester in the field of game aeronautics, testing air ship before they went available. On 28 April 1957, while leading a standard flight-check in a light air ship, a LF-1 ZaunkÃ¶nig, BÃ¤r put the flying machine into a level turn, the last move in the test procedure. The air ship spun down to at that point, unfit to recapture control, BÃ¤r was executed in the subsequent accident at Braunschweig-Waggum. 

The "National-Zeitung", a far-right German paper, highlighted a depiction of BÃ¤r in its arrangement "Extraordinary German Soldiers: Immortal Heroes" in May 2000. The National-Zeitung celebrated BÃ¤r's "dependability" and "swagger" and asserted that he was a "thrill seeker in the best sense". In "Jagdgeschwader" 51, the paper proceeded, he immediately picked up popularity and respect through brave activities; after his aggregate of 18 executes, he had been "promptly back in real life" with scarcely treated injuries. In the arrangement, just troopers faithful to the Nazi routine were respected, to some extent using phonetic equations initially utilized by the Wehrmacht and Nazi publicity. 

As indicated by the political researcher , the arrangement fits "the possibility of men concentrated on the deed and forming the course of history in light of a legitimate concern for the 'national' or 'vÃ¶lkisch' network", a thought, which is to be found on the extreme right. In the meantime, Virchow contends, the portrayals point to an idea of manliness whose extremely uneven attributes could be depicted by characteristics, for example, "hardness", "conciliatory will", "gallantry even with death", "dauntlessness", "flexibility", "dash" or "stamina". 

BÃ¤r, call sign "Bussard 1", flew in excess of 1,000 battle missions. His 220 affirmed flying triumphs place him eighth on the general rundown of "Experten". His case of 124 aeronautical triumphs over Western-flown flying machine is second just to Hans-Joachim Marseille's aggregate of 158; practically the majority of the last's triumphs happened in Africa. He accomplished four triumphs amid the Battle of France, 13 amid the Battle of Britain and 61 over Libya and Tunisia. On the Eastern Front he had guaranteed 96 ethereal triumphs. No less than 75 of his triumphs had been asserted against British-and American-flown air ship over Europe, 16 of these while flying the MeÂ 262 fly contender. Likewise among these 75 aeronautical triumphs are 21 US overwhelming aircraft and one Mosquito. BÃ¤r crash-landed or ransomed multiple times and was injured multiple times in battle. 

Matthews and Foreman, creators of "Luftwaffe Aces â Biographies and Victory Claims", investigated the German Federal Archives and discovered records for 208 ethereal triumph claims, in addition to 20 further unsubstantiated cases. This figure incorporates 95 aeronautical triumphs on the Eastern Front and 113 on the Western Front, including 14 four-engined aircraft and 15 triumphs with the Me 262 fly warrior. 

Triumph claims were logged to a guide reference (PQ = "Planquadrat"), for instance "PQ 05 Ost S/FN". The Luftwaffe matrix map () secured all of Europe, western Russia and North Africa and was made out of square shapes estimating 15 minutes of scope by 30 minutes of longitude, a zone of about . These divisions were then subdivided into 36 littler units to give an area region 3 Ã 4Â km in size. 

Multiple times BÃ¤r was prescribed for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (). Every one of the three tributes were denied by "Reichsmarschall" Hermann GÃ¶ring. BÃ¤r shot down a further 130 adversary flying machine after he had gotten the Swords.
