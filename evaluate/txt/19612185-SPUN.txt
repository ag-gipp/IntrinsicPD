The energized response of his companions to the open door persuaded him to play the job. Starting basic reactions to the character were generally positive, yet faultfinders later felt that the seven-scene Tritter story circular segment moved toward becoming "exhausting"; nonetheless, Morse was applauded for his depiction and picked up an Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series Emmy Award designation for his appearance in the scene "Discovering Judas". Morse expressed in a 2006 "television Guide" meet that, despite the fact that he had talked about it with journalists of the show, bringing the character back on the show would be "basically unthinkable". 

Tritter first shows up in the scene "Imbeciles for Love". His character is a police criminologist who experiences a serious disturbance in the region of his crotch, which he accepts to be brought about by an explicitly transmitted sickness, and who turns into a patient of the stroll in facility. In spite of the fact that House determined Tritter to have dry skin, a typical symptom of the nicotine gum that Tritter is biting, Tritter demands that an example be tried. House decreases in light of the fact that he has just met the current month's standard for reveling "obstinate imbeciles". After Tritter makes House trip, the specialist fakes quiet submission, yet demands he needs to take Tritter's temperature rectally. In the wake of embeddings the thermometer, House leaves the room, with no goal of returning. Tritter later whines about his treatment to House's manager, Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), saying that he would prefer to "beat the poop out of" House than sue him; notwithstanding, House will not apologize. Soon thereafter, Tritter pulls House over for a petty criminal offense and captures him in the wake of discovering Vicodin pills in his pocket. 

In the following scene, "Que SerÃ¡", Tritter looks through House's condo and finds a substantial amount of Vicodin pills and two clearly produced remedies that bear the name of House's companion James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard). Amid "Child of Coma Guy" and "Whac-A-Mole", Tritter weights Wilson and individuals from House's symptomatic group to affirm against him, yet they all decline. In "Discovering Judas", Cuddy discovers Tritter going through his day away from work glancing through the medical clinic's log for proof against House. She blames him for not having a real existence and "customizing each slight".

Toward the finish of the scene, Wilson visits Tritter and demonstrates his ability to affirm. 

In "Cheerful Little Christmas", Tritter and Wilson work out an arrangement to enable House to keep rehearsing drug on the off chance that he concedes and goes through two months in recovery. In the mean time, House utilizes a dead patient's name to acquire Oxycodone pills as a Vicodin substitution sedate.

In the last days paving the way to House's court case, House understands the seriousness of the circumstance lastly apologizes to Tritter (scene "Words and Deeds"). At the point when Tritter will not acknowledge the conciliatory sentiment, House goes into recovery, putting on a show for Tritter and the judge, however Tritter refers to his encounters with addicts as proof House has not changed. The judge reveals to Tritter that she doesn't trust House to be the street pharmacist that Tritter attempted to indicate him to be and arranges Tritter to proceed onward after House is excused because of Cuddy submitting prevarication. Just before the bailiff escorts House out of the court, Tritter lets him know: "Good karma. I trust I'm off-base about you." 

The primary enemy of the third season, Tritter is an "obstinate", "wrathful", and amazingly decided police criminologist. As indicated by David Morse, the hostile thermometer episode in "Idiots for Love" made it simple for Tritter to face House; as House's equivalent, Tritter "gets house's identity on all dimensions and can truly shake his establishment". Tritter's encounters with medication addicts shading his perspective on House, and he turns out to be so fixated on House that, as per official maker Katie Jacobs, the story curve transforms into "a clash of inner selves" between them. The character demonstrates a manipulative streak when he frames an arrangement to constrain every colleague affirm independently in "Discovering Judas". Robert Bianco of "USA Today" portrayed Tritter as an at first "really, assuming combatively, abused foe" character who later transforms into "some sort of crazy supercop, tearing his way through the emergency clinic and the Constitution voluntarily". 

The Tritter character was made as somebody to go "toe-to-toe" with House. The makers imagined a character with an internal quality, insight, and determination to coordinate that of House. In 2006, "House" maker David Shore reached on-screen character David Morse, with whom he had recently chipped away at "Hack", for a visitor featuring scene circular segment on the show. As per Ellen Gray of the "Philadelphia Daily News", Morse's prior depictions of "frightening" cops (in "16 Blocks" and "Hack") helped him secure the job. 

Morse was new to the show. In the wake of watching a few "House" scenes, he was amazed that the show had a solid crowd with "[such] an all out yank" as the lead character. It was not until Morse informed a couple of long-lasting companions concerning the activity offer that their excited response persuaded him to play the job. Katie Jacobs, official maker of "House", was inspired by Morse's execution. In a 2006 "television Guide" talk with, Morse said that, in spite of the fact that he examined the likelihood with "House" authors, it would be "essentially unimaginable" to get the character to return in any later seasons. 

Starting reactions to the character were generally positive. Maureen Ryan of the "Chicago Tribune" pronounced Tritter the best male antagonist of the fall of 2006. Lisa Edelstein, who depicts Lisa Cuddy on "House", named David Morse as one of her top pick "House" visitor stars, saying that he worked superbly depicting the character. Barbara Barnett from "Blog Critics Magazine" and Charles McGrath of "The New York Times" contrasted Tritter with Inspector Javert of "Les MisÃ©rables", and Alynda Wheat from "Stimulation Weekly" expressed that Tritter irritated House more than some other character, outperforming different adversaries, for example, Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek), Stacy Warner (Sela Ward), and Lucas Douglas (Michael Weston). "Variety"s Stuart Levine considered Tritter a "commendable adversary" for House. 

In any case, the proceeded with character curve progressively exhausted pundits. Staci Krause of IGN found the initial couple of scenes of SeasonÂ 3, in which House recuperates from being shot, additionally intriguing. In an audit of "Que Sera", "Amusement Weekly"s Michelle Kung noticed that while David Morse is a fine performing artist, "his cop is so strangely one-note and retribution twisted that his scenes are frequently simply painful to sit through". In an audit for "Numb-skulls for Love", Sara Morrison of Television Without Pity questioned that Tritter's vengeance on House merited his time and exacerbation, and later called the Tritter curve a "crazy mission for ass-thermometer equity". "The Star-Ledger"s Alan Sepinwall expressed that "setting House against a parody debilitated cop was both dull and not a reasonable battle". 

The show's fans had appeared for different enemies with multi-scene visitor featuring bends, and pundits presumed that Tritter's character would get comparable abhor. The finish of the storyline, and Tritter's takeoff from the show, were depicted by "USA Today" faultfinder Robert Bianco as a Christmas present for aficionados of the show. Morse facetiously expressed after his flight that different fans had let him know of their abhor for Tritter after what the character had done to Dr. House. 

Morse, be that as it may, picked up for the most part positive reactions to his depiction of Tritter. "The Star-Ledger"s Alan Sepinwall considered Morse a "great performer", and Maureen Ryan of the "Chicago Tribune" expressed that Morse's "downplayed execution" made Tritter even more terrifying.
