Splits in the third and fourth turns were starting to cause dealing with issues with the autos, and a transitory stockpiling unit was worked outside the track to suit the black-top required for restoring the track. The whole track, including the slip cushion and pit street, was reemerged, with the work finished presently before the 2006 UAW-Ford 500 started. 

Two hour long practice sessions were held the Friday before Sunday's race. In the principal session Jeff Gordon was the quickest, in front of Jarrett in second and Robby Gordon in third.

Early practice speeds drew nearer . NASCAR had ordered before the qualifier that the openings in the autos' restrictor plates be diminished by , later yielding that the standard may have influenced a few groups more than others. As indicated by Gilliland, "They tossed a curveball at us early today with the restrictor plate and (motor manufacturer) Doug Yates wasn't concerned in any way. He put the super-tune on it and the thing ran incredible." Earnhardt called the decrease in speed superfluous: "The track is safeÂ ... I don't feel (the late change in plate estimate) is a reasonable circumstance for everyone. When you're up around the 190s, what's two miles 60 minutes? I don't perceive what the major ordeal is. The speed normal is up in light of the fact that the corner speed stays better with the new black-top. To the extent running in a straight line, we're no quicker than we've generally kept running here." Despite the commanded change, NASCAR did not plan an extra practice session.

This gave Vickers the triumph (the first of his profession), in spite of the fact that he was booed by the group. 

Vickers showed up in Victory Lane to praise his first profession win before the group, winning $228,850 for the triumph. Earnhardt rushed to pardon him for the last-lap mishap: "He didn't wreck anybody deliberately. He was endeavoring to push the 48. I don't think he thought, 'Goodness, here's my opportunity to thump them both out.' He just got energized attempting to push the 48." Johnson was less cheerful: "We had an extraordinary opportunity to make up certain focuses and got smashed by a teammateÂ ... I was genuine patient until the white banner was up. I got a decent kept running inside the 8 and got a great deal of assistance from behind â an excess of helpÂ ... Realizing the circumstance we're all in, I would trust somebody would be somewhat more patient." Johnson's team boss, Chad Knaus, was irritated: "I simply don't think [Vickers] has the ability to comprehend what he has underneath him." 

Vickers, who might leave Hendrick Motorsports in 2007 for Red Bull Racing Team, stated: "I would anticipate that them should be somewhat vexed. Jimmie is my companion, my partner, and he is running for a title. However, he realizes similarly just as I do that on the off chance that I wasn't knock drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." Additionally, he denied that he drove all the more forcefully on the grounds that he was leaving. Third-place finisher Kurt Busch contended Vickers was in a "Conundrum" circumstance: "He was attempting to support his partner. It simply didn't turn out that way. Vickers was doing as well as could be expected to help the 48. He simply didn't envision the 8 vehicle hindering as long as he did." Vickers would later get extra security amid the following race end of the week. 

The outcome kept Burton ahead of the pack in the Drivers' Championship. After the race, Jeff Gordon (who was associated with the lap-137 mishap) was less hopeful about his title risks: "This essentially does it for us to the extent I'm worried for the title. You knew precisely that something to that effect would occur."
