Clash of Tory Island 

The Battle of Tory Island (now and then called the Battle of Donegal, Battle of Lough Swilly or Warren's Action) was a maritime activity of the French Revolutionary Wars, battled on 12 October 1798 among French and British squadrons off the northwest shore of County Donegal, at that point in the Kingdom of Ireland. The last activity of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, the Battle of Tory Island finished the last endeavor by the French Navy to arrive generous quantities of troopers in Ireland amid the war. 

The Society of United Irishmen, driven by Wolfe Tone, propelled an uprising against British guideline in Ireland in May 1798. In line with the dissidents, a little French power under General Humbert was arrived at Killala, County Mayo, however by early September both this campaign and the resistance had been vanquished. Uninformed of Humbert's surrender, the French despatched fortifications on 16 September. Having missed one intrusion constrain, the Royal Navy was on caution for another, and when the squadron conveying the fortifications left Brest they were before long spotted. After a long pursue, the French were conveyed to fight in a sound off the rough County Donegal coast in the west of Ulster, near Tory Island. Amid the activity the dwarfed French endeavored to get away, however were kept running down and vanquished piecemeal, with the British catching four ships and dissipating the survivors. Throughout the following fortnight, British frigate watches scoured the section back to Brest, catching three additional boats. Of the ten ships in the first French squadron, just two frigates and a clipper achieved wellbeing. English misfortunes in the crusade were negligible. 

The fight denoted the last endeavor by the French Navy to dispatch an attack of any piece of the British Isles. It additionally finished the last expectations the United Irishmen had of acquiring outside help in their battle with the British. After the activity, Tone was perceived on board the caught French lead and captured. He was brought shorewards by the British at Buncrana, on the Inishowen Peninsula. He was later striven for injustice, indicted, and ended it all while in jail in Dublin, hours before he was to be hanged. 

England's adversaries in mainland Europe had since quite a while ago perceived Ireland as a powerless point in Britain's guards. Landing troops there was a mainstream vital objective, not just in light of the fact that a trespasser could anticipate the help of a huge extent of the local populace, yet in addition on the grounds that at any rate at first they would confront less and less solid troops than somewhere else in the British Isles. Also, entangling the British Army in an extended Irish crusade would decrease its accessibility for different battlefields. At long last, French organizers thought about that a fruitful attack of Ireland may go about as the perfect stage for an ensuing intrusion of Great Britain. 

The talk of the French Revolution motivated numerous Irishmen to battle for comparable standards of freedom, fairness, and fraternity in their own country; freedom in this setting generally implied autonomy from Great Britain. In view of these objectives, in 1791 Dublin legal advisor Wolfe Tone established the Society of United Irishmen. Aligning itself with the French Republic, the general public was smothered by the British specialists and compelled to go underground when war broke out among France and Great Britain in 1793. Tone and different individuals furtively headed out to France to persuade the French National Convention to attack Ireland. Such an attack, they contended, could depend on help from huge quantities of Irish irregulars, and if effective would strike a serious hit to the British war exertionâmaybe even extreme enough to drive Britain to look for harmony. 

French political divisions made arranging an activity against Ireland troublesome. The procedure was additionally hampered by the French Atlantic Fleet's annihilation in 1794 at the Glorious First of June and the tragic CroisiÃ¨re du Grand Hiver task in 1795. Having lost a significant number of its best officers amid the political cleanses of The Terror, these annihilations reproduced a negative mindset in the French Navy, disheartening brave vital reasoning. In the long run, the "ExpÃ©dition d'Irlande" was despatched in December 1796 under Admiral Morard de Galles, comprising of 17 boats of the line and 27 littler vessels, and conveying upwards of 25,000 men. Regardless of components of the power going through as long as seven days in Bantry Bay, not a solitary French warrior was effectively landed, and the endeavor was an absolute fiasco, with 13 ships lost and more than 2,000 men suffocated. 

The next year, Tone and his colleagues attempted once more, this time convincing the legislature of the Batavian Republic, which was under French occupation, to set up their own campaign. Amid 1797, the Dutch armada was prepared and provisioned, planning to consolidate with the French armada and dispatch a second intrusion endeavor. The Batavian armada cruised on a preliminary assaulting journey in the North Sea in October 1797 and on their arrival were faced off the Dutch coast by the Royal Navy's North Sea Fleet under Admiral Sir Adam Duncan. Duncan promptly assaulted, and in the following Battle of Camperdown caught or obliterated ten ships and dissipated the rest, finishing the Batavian intrusion danger. 

Wanting to profit by the unconstrained uprising that spread crosswise over Ireland in May 1798, Commodore Daniel Savary drove a third, and increasingly fruitful, exertion. He took a little frigate squadron flying false British hues to Killala, and in August landed 1,150 French troops under General Humbert. A bigger power would have been despatched, yet the French had been gotten ill-equippedâthe Irish defiance had initially been intended to correspond with a later French landing, however British insight activities had penetrated the United Irishmen and captured quite a bit of its administration, provoking an encourage revolt. In spite of the fact that the uprising accomplished some early triumphs, when Humbert arrived its result had just been chosen with the thrashing of progressive revolutionary armed forces by British troops. Humbert's power was joined by many United Irishmen and had some underlying achievement, yet was unfit to confront prevalent British numbers at the Battle of Ballinamuck, and surrendered on 8 September. In spite of the fact that its little size enabled it to achieve Ireland in secret, nor Savary's frigate squadron nor the military it conveyed were sufficiently substantial to significantly affect the crusade. 

Uninformed that Humbert had surrendered and the disobedience been vanquished, the French arranged a subsequent undertaking under the direction of Commodore Jean-Baptiste-FranÃ§ois Bompart. Three thousand men were left on board the ship of the line "Hoche" and eight frigates, the power withdrawing Brest on 16 September. Be that as it may, having missed Savary's frigate squadron, the Royal Navy were progressively vigilant; meandering frigate watches traveled off the key French ports and in the ways to deal with Ireland, while squadrons of warships from the Channel Fleet cruised close-by, prepared to move against any new intrusion compel. In order of the squadron on the Irish station was Commodore Sir John Borlase Warren, an exceedingly experienced officer (and government official) who had become well known striking the French coast right off the bat in the war. 

Bompart's squadron left Brest late at night, wanting to slip past the inshore British barricade in obscurity. Notwithstanding, they took too long to even think about navigating the Raz entry, and were spotted at first light on 17 September by a frigate squadron under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, in HMS "Boadicea". Keats promptly separated his powers, requesting HMS "Ethalion" under Captain George Countess and the brig HMS "Sylph" under Commander John Chambers White to pursue the French power, while Keats conveyed updates on the French developments to Admiral Lord Bridport, chief of naval operations of the Channel Fleet. 

Mindful of the British interest, Bompart in any case proceeded toward the north. Royal lady pursued intently, and was joined on 18 September by HMS "Amelia" under Captain Charles Herbert. At first north of the French, "Amelia" had recognized the pursuit the earlier day and made up for lost time amid the night by going quietly through Bompart's squadron. The following day, Bompart endeavored to lose his followers by bluffing towards Lorient, and again the next day by bluffing south, as though going towards the Antilles. In any case, the British chiefs stayed on track, and by 20 September were just nine miles from Bompart's power, which was proceeding with south-west as if cruising for the Americas. HMS "Anson", a substantial razee frigate under Captain Philip Charles Durham, joined the British power on 20 September. 

Regardless of Bompart's endeavors to camouflage his goal, by the night of 23 September Countess had accurately reasoned the French were setting out toward Ireland, and despatched the brig "Sylph" to caution Commodore Warren and some other British boats she ran over. After two days, on 25 September, Commodore Bompart was compelled to pull toward the east and lose ground to his followers when a 100-transport British escort go toward the north. This caravan comprised of some very much furnished East Indiamen, ensured by a few frigates, and represented a genuine risk to Bompart's over-burden ships. He at that point attempted to drive off interest by bluffing towards Countess' squadron, however the quicker British ships just pulled back to a sheltered separation, continuing their pursuit once the French had come back to their unique course. On 29 September Bompart made a last offer to shake his followers; he endeavored to draw in the British frigates with three of his ownâ"ImmortalitÃ©", "Loire" and another. This arrangement bombed after his leader "Hoche" lost a topmast in substantial climate and fell behind the remainder of the squadron, constraining the frigates to come back to her insurance. 

Unfit to get away, Bompart at long last relinquished his misrepresentation of cruising for the Americas and rather turned north-west. Amid the following day high breezes cost both "Hoche" and "Anson" a topmast, moderating the two squadrons, yet the fixes to "Hoche" were led quicker and the French had the capacity to pull ahead. For four more days interest proceeded with straightforwardly north, until 4 October, when a tempest slipped and Bompart effectively beat Countess in the expanding dimness. In the high breezes, "Amelia" was pushed off kilter and far from her countrymen on 7 October while "Anson" again endured harm, this time losing two topmasts. 

On 11 October the climate cleared, and spotting two sails toward the south, Countess took "Ethalion" to explore. The boats were "Amelia" and a ship of the line of Warren's squadron, who having gotten "Sylph's" notice on 23 September, was cruising north trying to capture the French. Warren's squadron of three boats of the line and the razee frigate HMS "Magnanime" had been joined the day preceding by two extra frigates positioned at Lough Swilly; HMS "Melampus" under Captain Graham Moore and HMS "Doris" under Captain Lord Ranelagh. Warren appended "Melampus" to his squadron and separated "Doris" to scout along the Irish coast and caution the British armies, particularly along the bank of County Donegal and the North-West of Ireland locale for the most part. "Doris" was additionally to scout along part of the shore of the West of Ireland locale, further south, where the past French landing had been affected at Killala. 

Having at long last evaded his followers, Bompart made legitimately for Lough Swilly where the arrival was planned to happen. Unconscious of the defiance's thrashing, he trusted that Humbert's military would work in the Lough Swilly region, as expected in the crusade arranged before Humbert left France. Touching base off the coast, Bompart looked for an appropriate landing site yet was unfit to discover one preceding dull on 10 October. He held up out the night near Tory Island, yet was astonished the following day by sails seemingly within easy reach; Warren's squadron had been joined by Countess' boats, and a staggering power was hunkering down on the French. Relinquishing all thoughts of finding the troops, Bompart pulled his boats near the breeze to give them space to move and permit their commanders however much open door as could be expected to get away from the moving toward British. 

For the duration of the day, Warren's squadron shut from the north-east while Bompart attempted unhinged endeavors to achieve untamed water. The two armadas were obstructed by a storm which cleared the ocean in a matter of seconds before 20:00. Each of the three of "Hoche's" topmasts were blown down and her mizzensail destroyed, abandoning her generously slower than her comrades and compelling them to keep down with all due respect. Different boats endured as well, as the French "RÃ©solue" sprang a serious break and HMS "Anson" lost her mizzenmast and a few topmasts. 

Amid the night, Bompart endeavored to imitation the British by sending the yacht "Biche" with requests for the frigate "RÃ©solue", ordering Captain Jean-Pierre Bargeau to shoreline his ship and flame flares in the desire for diverting Warren from his interest. For obscure reasons this request was never completed, and toward the beginning of the day Warren was still hard behind Bompart, whose ships were presently cruising in two uneven lines. Warren's power was considerably increasingly scattered, with HMS "Hearty" and HMS "Magnanime" toward the back of the French and increasing quick, "Amelia" and "Melampus" in the blink of an eye behind them and Warren's lead HMS "Canada" with HMS "Foudroyant" under Captain Sir Thomas Byard, Kt., from the adversary. The other British boats were dissipated all through this development with the exception of "Anson", which was floundering to the back, out of sight locate. 

Understanding that he couldn't escape and would need to battle his way past the British, Bompart shaped his squadron into a battleline and turned westwards, sitting tight for Warren's flag for the assault. As a result of the scattered idea of his squadron, Warren did not issue this flag until 07:00, when he requested "Strong" to control for the French line and assault "Hoche" straightforwardly. Chief Edward Thornbrough of "Hearty" obeyed promptly and shut with the French, terminating into the frigates "Embuscade" and "Coquille" as he go, before shutting with "Hoche" and, at 08:50, starting a severe short proximity big guns duel. Minutes after the fact "Magnanime" joined the activity, terminating on the back frigates and connecting with the French van of "ImmortalitÃ©", "Loire" and "Bellone", which had exhausted of the line trying to rake her. The following three British boats energetically, "Ethalion", "Melampus" and "Amelia", all raked the segregated "Hoche" as they go, before going ahead sail to seek after the French frigates, presently making separation toward the south-west. "Canada" and the ensuing British ships all overlooked "Hoche" but to shoot a couple of far off shots. When they passed, the ship was unmistakably a disaster area, having been beat over and again by "Hearty" and "Magnanime". Bompart at last surrendered at 10:50 with 270 of his team and travelers slaughtered or injured. 

"Embuscade" was the alongside surrender, having been battered in the opening trades by "Magnanime", and further harmed by long-go fire from "Foudroyant" amid the interest. Redesignd by a few bigger British boats, Captain de la RonciÃ©re surrendered at 11:30 instead of enable his ship to be wrecked. "Magnanime", enduring the impacts of her commitment with "Hoche", claimed "Embuscade" and kept on following gradually behind the remainder of the armada, while "Strong", which had endured seriously in her duel with "Hoche", stayed close by her recent rival to collect. The bearing of the French squadron's flight, following the heading of the breeze, took them over the way of the straggling British boats, starting with the "Foudroyant". The greater part of the frigates were capable surpassed this unwieldy adversary, yet "Bellone" was less lucky and a theoretical shot from the war vessel exploded an instance of explosives in one of her topmasts. This started a tragic flame which was in the long run brought leveled out, yet at a critical expense in speed. She was soon intently assaulted by "Melampus" and endured further harm. Adjacent, the battling "Coquille" surrendered in the wake of being surpassed by the drawing nearer "Canada"; Warren requested the gradually following "Magnanime" to collect. 

"Ethalion" took over quest for "Bellone" from "Melampus", and for two hours kept up ceaseless flame with her bow-chasers on the French ship. "Ethalion" was quicker than her quarry, and she gradually pulled parallel with "Bellone" amid the evening, yet couldn't draw sufficiently near for a conclusive blow. It took an additional two hours of interest before the battered "Bellone" inevitably surrendered. "Hoche" separated, "Bellone" had endured a greater number of losses than some other ship present. Toward the south of this contention, the battling "Anson" found herself in threat when the enduring frigates of the French vanguard cleared towards her as a group. Skipper Durham was at first confounded by their methodology as he had been too far off to even consider witnessing the activity and the French boats flew false British ensigns, however he quickly understood their actual character and at 16:00 opened flame on "Loire". The harmed "Anson" was seriously hampered by her failure to move, thus could do nothing when the French boats pulled back and cruised away, but to keep on terminating until they were out of range. Amid the night, the enduring French frigates step by step pulled far from their followers and vanished into the social event night, abandoning four of their squadron, including their leader, as prisoners. 

By dusk a portion of the staying French boats had entered Donegal Bay with "Canada", "Melampus" "Foudroyant" still in interest. The two powers over and over passed each other in obscurity, and "Canada" nearly drove shorewards. Back at the fight site, Warren had requested "Hearty" to tow "Hoche" into Lough Swillyâthis request later went under analysis, as "Vigorous" was in a battered state herself and the tempests of the earlier week had not lessened. At the point when a storm struck the pair on 13 October, "Hoche" lost a few poles and broke her tow, just being kept from foundering by the consolidated endeavors of the British prize team and their French detainees. In the end, on 15 October, "Doris" showed up and took "Hoche" close behind, touching base in Lough Swilly moving forward without any more episode a couple of days after the fact. In the interim, "Ethalion" saw "Bellone" securely into port, and "Magnanime" and "Amelia" acquired "Coquille" and "Embuscade" individually. 

On the morning of 13 October, Warren located two of the French frigates emerging of Donegal Bay and followed them, coordinating Moore in "Melampus" to remain behind to look for stragglers. Frustrated by opposite breezes, "Melampus" scoured the narrows until well after sunset, and at 23:30 was shocked by the abrupt appearance straightforwardly before her of "ImmortalitÃ©" and "RÃ©solue" close St. John's Point. "ImmortalitÃ©" before long spotted "Melampus" and made sail, yet Captain Bargeau of "RÃ©solue" had not seen the British ship, and was reluctant about after his countryman in obscurity. In the misery and disarray, he mixed up "Melampus" for "ImmortalitÃ©" and came close by, possibly understanding his oversight when "Melampus" opened flame. In view of the substantial oceans, "RÃ©solue's" weapons had been secured underneath decks, so the main return discharge she could offer was from her bunch of quarterdeck firearms. Bargeau, whose transport was all the while releasing gravely, perceived that further obstruction was purposeless and surrendered in minutes, having lost ten men and quite a bit of his gear. "Melampus" put on board a prize group and after that left in quest for "ImmortalitÃ©". 

"Loire" and "SÃ©millante" had gotten away from the fight into Black Sod Bay, where they would have liked to cover up until they had a reasonable section back to France. Be that as it may, late on 15 October, a British frigate squadron under James Newman-Newman adjusted the southern headland of the straight, constraining the French boats to escape toward the north. Going ahead sail in interest, Newman requested HMS "RÃ©volutionaire" to concentrate on "SÃ©millante" while he sought after "Loire" in HMS "Mermaid", joined by the brig HMS "Kangaroo" under Commander Edward Brace. "Loire" and "SÃ©millante" isolated to separate their followers; "Mermaid" and "Kangaroo" forgot about "Loire" in the early night, and "SÃ©millante" dodged "RÃ©volutionaire" after dull. 

Notwithstanding, on the morning of 16 October Newman spotted "Loire" seemingly within easy reach and quickly requested his boats in interest. "Loire" was quicker than "Mermaid" in the high breezes yet was unfit to beat "Kangaroo", which straightforwardly drew in the far bigger frigate in a removed cannons duel. The distinction in weight of shot between the soldiers was incredibly uneven, and "Kangaroo" in the end fell behind subsequent to enduring harm to her gear. "Loire" also had been harmed, and by 06:45 the next morning Captain Segond acknowledged he couldn't get away from his followers and rather abbreviated sail, meaning to draw in "Mermaid"â by then the main follower still inside reach. 

"Mermaid" and "Loire" joined fight at 07:00, and the mounted guns trade turned out to be close and incensed after a boarding endeavor by "Loire" was thwarted by the helmsman of the British ship. The two boats took serious harm, "Mermaid" thumping endlessly a few of her rival's fights, however experiencing thus the musketry of the warriors still on board the "Loire". At 09:15, the French vessel lost another fight, and Newman resolved to rake his adversary. As he endeavored to finish this move, a shot from "Loire" cut down "Mermaid's" mizzenmast, making her unmanageable and debilitating some of her weapons. Seeing a chance to get away, the battered "Loire" withdrew, making huge separation before Newman's team could clear the destruction of the pole. High breezes additionally hampered "Mermaid's" fix endeavors by tearing ceaselessly a few sails and competes and suffocating the ship's woodworker when he was blown over the edge. When "Mermaid" was good to go yet again, "Loire" had gotten away. 

Shockingly for Captain Segond, when first light broke on 18 October, HMS "Anson" was uncovered just a short separation off, limping southwards after the harm its gear and poles had endured before the fight on 12 October. Despite the fact that his ship was practically unmanageable, Captain Durham was not set up to lose a second chance to connect with, and gradually presented his vessel as a powerful influence for "Loire", which was unfit to get away. Going with "Anson" was "Kangaroo", recouped from the harm of 16 October and prepared for further activity. At 10:30, "Anson" and "Loire" started terminating on each other, neither ready to adequately move and both depending on capability to overpower their rival. "Kangaroo" shut on the unprotected stern of "Loire", terminating as she did as such and more than once raking the stationary French ship. By 12:00 "Loire" had lost her mainmast and was spilling severely, driving Segond to surrender. His ship was towed to port as the 6th prize of the crusade. 

The four residual overcomers of the French armada had for the most part evaded interest, and by 19 October were nearing Brest autonomously, planning to sneak past the tight British barricade around the harbor. Skipper Mathieu-Charles Bergevin on "Romaine" had endeavored to arrive the troops on board his ship in Ireland on 13 October, yet was compelled to desert this arrangement when the officers wouldn't be put aground. He at that point cruised southwest and effectively dodged all contact with British powers, uniting with the yacht "Biche" and touching base at Brest on 23 October. That day, in the wake of surpassing "RÃ©volutionaire's" interest, "SÃ©millante" touched base in Lorientâthe last French ship to return home. 

"ImmortalitÃ©" nearly achieved wellbeing. On the morning of 20 October, Captain Jean-FranÃ§ois Legrand was moving toward Brest when he was spotted by Captain Thomas Byam Martin of HMS "Fisgard". "Fisgard", some portion of the inshore squadron of the Brest barricade, promptly offered fight. "ImmortalitÃ©" at first endeavored to escape however was compelled to draw in the quicker "Fisgard" at 11:00. Amid the harsh, closeâ go activity, "Fisgard" took extreme harm and nearly lost her adversary. "ImmortalitÃ©", which had lost a pole and was in a sinking condition, surrendered at 15:00. Among the 115 setbacks on board "ImmortalitÃ©" were Captain Legrand, his first lieutenant and General Monge (officer of the 250 troopers ready), all dead. "Fisgard", with the guide of different boats of the barricade squadron, effectively brought her prize into port. 

The French central leadership had not been inert amid the annihilation of their intrusion constrain, and had arranged and despatched a second squadron of four frigates under Commodore Daniel Savary. This power was at first arranged to help Bompart, yet was later entrusted with escorting the squadron's survivors back to France. On 27 October, Savary educated of the decimation of both Bompart's squadron and the Irish defiance from thoughtful local people at Killala, and turned quickly south, wanting to stay away from a comparable destiny. In any case, on 28 October, he was spotted by a three-dispatch squadron under Captain Sir James Saumarez, which included two boats of the line. Saumarez quickly gave pursue, and the squadrons traded long-separate gun shoot for the duration of the day. Late at night Saumarez's leader HMS "Caesar" lost its foretopmast in solid breezes, and direction go to Sir Richard Bickerton, second Bt., in HMS "Horrible". 

After one more day's pursuit, late on 29 October Savary separated his squadron, sending two frigates toward the south east and turning north west with two more. Accordingly, Bickerton split his power, sending the frigate HMS "Melpomene" after the southern gathering and following Savary himself in "Horrendous". By 30 October, both British boats were inside of their rivals and were getting ready for activity, when at 17:00 a serious tempest lashed the territory. Savary's boats had been expanding their interest by tossing weapons, steeds and gear over the edge with an end goal to help their boats, and were therefore more qualified to the high breezes. The heavier British boats were unfit to coordinate their rivals' speed and fell behind. At the point when the climate cleared, the French boats were far out, and every one of the four in the end returned autonomously to Brest, finishing the last French endeavor to attack Ireland. 

A fruitless exertion to help the French attack armada was likewise made by the Navy of the Batavian Republic, which despatched the little frigates "Furie" and "Waakzaamheid" to Ireland with military supplies on 24 October. Inside long periods of leaving port, both these boats were blocked and caught by the British frigate HMS "Sirius" under the youthful Captain Richard King at the Action of 24 October 1798. 

Savary's arrival to port denoted the finish of the last endeavor by a mainland country to arrive troops in Ireland. French misfortunes in the activity were severe to the point that a recurrent exertion was never truly considered. Thus, the tremendous Irish misfortunes amid the resistance, joined with British backlashes against the Irish masses, finished any expectations of reigniting the uprising sooner rather than later. Most genuine of for the United Irishmen was simply the capture of Wolfe Tone, who was found among the detainees taken from "Hoche" at Buncrana. Tone was accused of injustice and condemned to death, however he ended it all in Dublin before the sentence could be done. 

In Britain the commitment was viewed as an incredible achievement, with the thanks of Parliament offered on the whole power. Various junior officers were advanced and all group individuals got budgetary prizes from the closeout of the caught vessels. Of these prizes, "ImmortalitÃ©" and "Loire" were bought and served in the Royal Navy under their very own names for a long time, while "Hoche" and "Embuscade" were renamed HMS "Donegal" and HMS "Ambuscade" separately. "Coquille" was planned for buy however endured a calamitous ammo blast in December 1798, which slaughtered 13 individuals and completely obliterated the vessel. The last two prizes, "RÃ©solue" and "Bellone", were esteemed excessively old and harmed to be deserving of dynamic administration. They were, be that as it may, obtained by the Royal Navy to furnish their captors with prize cash, "Bellone" getting to be HMS "Proserpine" and "RÃ©solue" getting to be HMS "Resolue". The two boats filled in as harbor vessels for certain years until they were separated. After five decades, the fight was among the activities perceived by the catch, "twelfth October 1798", appended to the Naval General Service Medal, granted upon application to every single British member as yet living in 1847. 

. The real line and heading of the British methodology has not been definitively settled because of the unclearness of Warren's post-fight report. Richard Brooks examines these inconsistencies and reasons that Warren's squadron, albeit broadly scattered, was likely drawing nearer from roughly the north-west, from the North Atlantic towards Ireland.
