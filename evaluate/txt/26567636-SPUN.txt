He came back to Richmond in May 1938 to lead No.Â 3 Squadron, working Demons, and again partook in aerobatic shows. On 25Â October 1938, his Demon slammed in clean at Tumbi Umbi, New South Wales, when the motor bombed not long after taking off for Richmond, yet he was not harmed. Finishing his Richmond arrangement in May 1939, Walters exchanged to Melbourne as Director of Staff Duties at RAAF Headquarters. Soon thereafter, he joined Group Captain Henry Wrigley as a specialist assessor on the board of an investigation into an ongoing arrangement of three Anson mishaps; the full report passed on in October discovered human mistake the feasible clarification for something like one accident and that preparation on the sort pursued the prospectus set down, yet that pilots required progressively reasonable involvement in managing potential in-flight episodes. 

Walters' first operational arrangement following the episode of World WarÂ II was as boss of No.Â 1 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron, which he prompted Sembawang, Singapore, in July 1940.

On 7Â October 1942, Walters took order of another arrangement, No.Â 1 (Fighter) Wing, at RAAF Station Richmond. Set up to lift the air protection capacity of Australia's North-Western Area, the wing included three Supermarine Spitfire squadrons that had been exchanged from Europe: No.Â 54 Squadron RAF, No.Â 452 Squadron RAAF and No.Â 457 Squadron RAAF. With Wing Commander Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring flying pro of the war, as his wing head, Walters started sending air ship and men to Darwin, Northern Territory, in December, giving a filip to resolve in the area. Gladly proclaiming himself Australia's most seasoned military pilot, Walters was accounted for as accepting each open door to join his men noticeable all around. He flew as Caldwell's wingman in No.Â 1 Wing's first real activity against the Japanese over Darwin on 2Â May 1943. Eight Spitfires slammed and a few others made constrained arrivals, for the devastation of one Japanese aircraft and five warriors.

After they landed, Caldwell criticized his officer, "You senseless old so-thus. You need to care for your very own skin as opposed to stressing over somebody else's!" On 20Â June, Walters took part in the wing's best battle against the Japanese to that time, expressly representing one of fourteen bandits asserted by the Spitfires, for the loss of two of their own number. He posted out of Darwin a couple of days after the fact, having earned the esteem of Caldwell and the remainder of the wing's work force. 

Walters expected direction of No.Â 5 Service Flying Training School in Uranquinty, New South Wales, on 30Â June 1943, however the following month was presented on Merauke in Dutch New Guinea to take over No.Â 72 Wing following reassignment of its unique leader, Group Captain Charles Eaton.

In February 1945, Walters was elevated to acting air commodore and took over from Air Commodore Lukis as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Northern Command, coordinating its tasks in New Guinea, New Britain and Bougainville until the finish of the war. Headquartered at Madang in Papua New Guinea, Northern Command had recently been an expansive portable development known as No.Â 9 (Operational) Group however had advanced into an army compel, its versatile capacity superseded by No.Â 10 (Operational) Group (later First Tactical Air Force). Northern Command's operational developments included No.Â 71 Wing in northern New Guinea, No.Â 74 Wing at Port Moresby, and No.Â 84 Wing on Bougainville. No.Â 71 Wing, directed by Group Captain Val Hancock, upheld the Australian 6thÂ Division amid the Aitapeâ Wewak Campaign, regardless of weapons lacks that at one phase prompted its squadrons outfitting their Bristol Beauforts with caught Japanese bombs. No.Â 84 Wing endured deficiencies in pilots and gear amid the Bougainville Campaign, and resolve issues following the finish of the war inferable from inertia and the vulnerabilities of grounding; therefore, the wing's leader sent Northern Command central command a straight to the point report, the tone of which earned a reproach from Walters. In September, Walters spoke to the RAAF at the Japanese surrender services in Wewak. 

Walters was selected a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the King's Birthday Honors on 25Â June 1946, for his "obvious administration in tasks against the Japanese" while driving Northern Command amid the war. Subsequent to finishing his term as AOC Northern Command that year, Walters again progressed toward becoming Director of Staff Plans and Policy at RAAF Headquarters. He went to the Imperial Defense College, London, in 1947. Walters was among a little cadre of very respected operational officers, including Air Commodores John McCauley, Fred Scherger and Val Hancock, reserved by the Australian Air Board for senior influential positions in the post-war RAAF. Temporarily, he remained a transitory air commodoreâwith the substantive position of gathering chief from May 1947âas the officer corps shrank definitely with deactivation. He was chosen as AOC Southern Area Command, center point of the RAAF's preparation association, in March 1948.

In January 1951, Walters was designated AOC RAAF Overseas Headquarters in London. That December, he was a piece of the Australian unforeseen at the Commonwealth Air Forces Conference, where a RAAF nearness was looked for in the Middle East; this in the end brought about No.Â 78 Wing being re-shaped and conveyed to Malta in July 1952. In spite of the fact that Walters was quick to utilize the chance to procure the RAAF's first North American F-86 Sabers, political substances drove him to arrange an arrangement whereby the wing was outfitted with rented British de Havilland Vampire FB.9s. In October 1952, Walters was elevated to acting air bad habit marshal and presented on Washington,Â D.C., to head up the Australian Joint Services Staff as successor to Air Vice Marshal Scherger.

Walters was selected a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1956 New Year Honors. In March 1957, he was one of three hopefuls, alongside Air Vice Marshals Scherger and Hancock, touted as conceivable successors to Air Marshal Sir John McCauley as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. In spite of the fact that Walters was viewed as entirely capable, Scherger had for some time been viewed as extraordinary and seemed to be "effectively the best material on offer" as indicated by a previous CAS, Air Marshal Sir Donald Hardman. Scherger picked up the arrangement, and Walters progressed toward becoming Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 21Â October. As AMP he involved a seat reporting in real time Board, the administration's controlling body that included its senior officers and was led by the CAS. In this job Walters supported the proposals of a survey by the AOC Training Command, Air Vice Marshal Ian McLachlan, that prompted an arrangement of RAAF College cadets undertaking scholastic degrees, in accordance with comparable establishments in the other equipped administrations; the school was hence renamed RAAF Academy. Walters filled in as AMP until August 1959. The next month he was selected AOC Support Command, another association made by blending the RAAF's previous Training and Maintenance Commands. At the point when Scherger's term as CAS was because of complete in May 1961, Walters and Hancock were yet again advanced to the Minister for Air as potential substitutions. "Walters was again unfortunate", in the expressions of Air Force students of history Alan Stephens and Keith Isaacs, Hancock's "proficient capacity, operational experience and individual characteristics" being regarded increasingly proper for the job. 

Walters left the RAAF on 16Â May 1962, in the wake of finishing his posting at Headquarters Support Command. His pending retirement and progression via Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy had been reported the past November. Walters pursued pony hustling in private life.
