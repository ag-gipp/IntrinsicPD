Isle of Portland 

The Isle of Portland is a limestone tied island, long by wide, in the English Channel. Portland is south of the retreat of Weymouth, shaping the southernmost purpose of the region of Dorset, England. A boundary shoreline called Chesil Beach goes along with it to the terrain. The A354 street goes down the Portland end of the shoreline and afterward over the Fleet Lagoon by extension to the terrain. Portland and Weymouth together structure the precinct of Weymouth and Portland. The number of inhabitants in Portland is 12,400. 

Portland is a focal piece of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site on the Dorset and east Devon coast, imperative for its topography and landforms. Portland stone, well known for its utilization in British and world design, including St Paul's Cathedral and the United Nations Headquarters, keeps on being quarried. 

Portland Harbor, in the middle of Portland and Weymouth, is one of the biggest man-made harbors on the planet. The harbor was made by the structure of stone jetties somewhere in the range of 1848 and 1905. From its beginning it was a Royal Navy base, and assumed conspicuous jobs amid the First and Second World Wars; boats of the Royal Navy and NATO nations worked up and practiced in its waters until 1995. The harbor is currently a non military personnel port and well known diversion zone, and was utilized for the 2012 Olympic Games. 

The name Portland is utilized for one of the British Sea Areas, and has been sent out as the name of North American and Australian towns. 

Portland has been occupied since at any rate the Mesolithic time frame (the Middle Stone Age)â there is archeological proof of Mesolithic occupants at the Culverwell Mesolithic Site, close Portland Bill, and of residence from that point forward. The Romans involved Portland, supposedly calling it "Vindelis". 

Despite the fact that the start of the Viking Age in England is dated to their attack in 793, when they devastated the monastery on Lindisfarne, their first reported landing happened in Portland four years sooner, in 789, as recorded in the "Old English Saxon Chronicle". Three lost Viking ships from Hordaland (the region around Hardanger fjord in west Norway) arrived at Portland Bill. The ruler's reeve attempted to gather charges from them, yet they executed him and cruised on. 

In 1539 King Henry VIII arranged the development of Portland Castle for resistance against assaults by the French; the chÃ¢teau cost Â£4,964. It is a standout amongst the best safeguarded strongholds from this period, and is opened to people in general by the caretakers English Heritage. 

In the seventeenth century, boss modeler and Surveyor-General to James I, Inigo Jones, overviewed the zone and acquainted the nearby Portland stone with London, utilizing it in his Banqueting House, Whitehall, and for fixes on St Paul's Cathedral. His successor, Sir Christopher Wren, the planner and Member of Parliament for close-by Weymouth, utilized six million tons of white Portland limestone to remake demolished pieces of the capital after the Great Fire of London of 1666. Surely understood structures in the capital, including St Paul's Cathedral and the eastern front of Buckingham Palace highlight the stone. After the First World War, a quarry was opened by The Crown Estate to give stone to the Cenotaph in Whitehall and a large portion of a million tombstones for war burial grounds, and after the Second World War a huge number of headstones were slashed for troopers who had fallen on the Western Front. Portland concrete has nothing to do with Portland; it was so named because of its comparable shading to Portland stone when blended with lime and sand. 

There have been railroads in Portland since the mid nineteenth century. The Merchant's Railway was the soonestâit opened in 1826 (one year after the Stockton and Darlington railroad) and kept running from the quarries at the north of Tophill to a dock at Castletown, from where the Portland stone was transported around the nation. The Weymouth and Portland Railway was laid in 1865, and kept running from a station in Melcombe Regis, over the Fleet and along the low isthmus behind Chesil Beach to a station at Victoria Square in Chiswell. Toward the finish of the nineteenth century the line was stretched out to the highest point of the island as the Easton and Church Ope Railway, going through Castletown and rising the precipices at East Weares, to circle back north to a station in Easton. The line shut to travelers in 1952, and the last products train (and two traveler 'specials') kept running in April 1965. 

The Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck positioned a raft at Portland in 1826, which was pulled back in 1851. Waterfront flooding has influenced Portland's inhabitants and transport for a considerable length of timeâthe main way off the island via land is along the boulevard in the lee of Chesil Beach. On occasion of outrageous floods (about at regular intervals) this street connect is cut by floods. The low-lying town of Chiswell used to flood all things considered like clockwork. Chesil Beach every so often faces serious tempests and enormous waves, which have a get over the Atlantic Ocean. Following two serious flood occasions during the 1970s, Weymouth and Portland Borough Council and Wessex Water chose to examine the structure of the shoreline, and seaside the executives conspires that could be worked to secure Chiswell and the shoreline street. During the 1980s it was concurred that a plan to secure against a one-in-five-year tempest would be practicable; it would decrease flood profundity and span in increasingly serious tempests. Hard designing strategies were utilized in the plan, including a gabion hurrying toward the north of Chiswell, an all-encompassing ocean divider in Chesil Cove, and a duct running from inside the shoreline, underneath the shoreline street and into Portland Harbor, to redirect rising water far from low-lying regions. 

Toward the beginning of the First World War, HMS "Hood" was soaked in the section between the southern sea walls to shield the harbor from torpedo and submarine assault. Portland Harbor was framed (1848â 1905) by the development of embankments, however before that the regular mooring had facilitated boats of the Royal Navy for over 500 years. It was a middle for Admiralty examination into asdic submarine discovery and submerged weapons from 1917 to 1998; the shore base HMS Serepta was renamed HMS Osprey in 1927. Amid the Second World War Portland was the objective of substantial besieging, albeit most warships had moved north as Portland was inside adversary striking extent over the Channel. Portland was a noteworthy embarkation point for Allied powers on D-Day in 1944.

The station was formally authorized as HMS Osprey, which at that point turned into the biggest and busiest military helicopter station in Europe. The base was progressively improved with extra landing territories and one of England's briefest runways, at . 

The maritime base shut after the finish of the Cold War in 1995, and the Royal Naval Air Station shut in 1999, despite the fact that the runway stayed being used for Her Majesty's Coastguard Search and Rescue flights as MRCC Portland until 2014. MRCC Portland's territory of duty expanded halfway over the English Channel, and from Start Point in Devon to the Dorset/Hampshire outskirt, covering a region of around . The 12 Search and Rescue groups in the Portland zone managed right around 1000 episodes in 2005. 

There are as yet two penitentiaries on Portland: HMP The Verne, which until 1949 was an enormous Victorian military stronghold, and a Young Offenders' Institution (HMYOI) on the Grove clifftop. This was the first jail (HM Prison Portland) worked for convicts who quarried stone for the Portland Breakwaters from 1848. For a couple of years until 2005 Britain's solitary jail send, HMP "The Weare", was berthed in the harbor.

Portland stone lies under Tophill; the strata decay at a shallow point of around 1.5 degrees, from a tallness of close to the Verne in the north, to simply above ocean level at Portland Bill. The topography of Underhill is diverse to Tophill; Underhill lies on a lofty slope made out of Portland Sand, lying over a thicker layer of Kimmeridge Clay, which reaches out to Chesil Beach and Portland Harbor. This Kimmeridge Clay has brought about a progression of avalanches, framing West Weares and East Weares.
