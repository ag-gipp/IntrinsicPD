It was discharged on 30 July 2008 in Japan through Toshiba EMI and on 4 August 2008 in the British Isles on Parlophone, the band's essential mark.

The record crested at number 28 on the UK Albums Chart, however neglected to outline in the United States. 

The collection was recorded in frontman Sam Eastgate's room in Castle Donington, England, and at a few areas in London. It experienced a cracked innovative procedure that went on for over two years. It was in the long run created by Eastgate and DJ Erol Alkan somewhere in the range of 2007 and 2008. "Dream Black Channel" does not contain a binding together melodic or expressive subject; rather, it is a composition of the considerable number of thoughts, kinds, and studio impacts that entranced the band individuals and Alkan, particularly amid live account sessions. The record was very generally welcomed by faultfinders. It was frequently treated as a standout amongst the best British collections of 2008 due to its diversity and soul of creation. Late of the Pier did not record any further collections following the passing of drummer Ross Dawson in 2015. 

Having formally shaped a band under the name Late of the Pier in 2004, cherished companions Sam Eastgate, Andrew Faley, Sam Potter, and the late Ross Dawson at first built up the sound of their first collection by tuning in to the elective move music of British outfit The Prodigy and the grunge music of American band Nirvana. They before long fanned out into tuning in to various kinds from the most recent 40 years of music, including Motown and soul. Potter has treated their origination of "Imagination Black Channel" as a response to "average, smug non mainstream schmindie groups who locate a sound and stick to it; whose melodies sound precisely the equivalent", while lead essayist and arranger Eastgate has indicated out that they needed "take individuals past their very own cutoff points". The early chronicle stages occurred in Eastgate's room, where unpredictable time marks and exploratory harmonies were performed in light of the fact that, at the time, no band part could play an instrument legitimately. 

Late of the Pier began utilizing the collection working title "Fascinating Adventure" in 2006 in the wake of rehearsing in Eastgate's room for about a year and reviewed their new material at the Liars Club in Nottingham. Subsequent to accepting contract offers from Parlophone and Atlantic Records, the band individuals marked to Parlophone on the grounds that the name gave them all out self-rule over the account procedure without constraining them to be industrially fruitful right away. The record bargain was trailed by the account of an EP titled "Zarcorp Demo", from which a demo single, "Space and the Woods", was discharged in March 2007. Eastgate has asserted that the band individuals were affected by the music of the 1980s amid these developmental phases of "Imagination Black Channel" despite the fact that none of them were conceived before 1986. 

In late 2007, Late of the Pier formally met prestigious DJ Erol Alkan in the wake of seeing him play a set at the Liars Club. Alkan called them "THE most energizing band around" and offered the band individuals help in the chronicle procedure of "Imagination Black Channel". They acknowledged and made him maker for the collection in view of the quick affinity that created between the two gatherings. Dawson has clarified the decision of maker by recommending that Alkan is well known for playing wide types of music and that he comprehends the properties and hybrid of move and guitar music. Alkan completely grasped the band individuals' thoughts and quickly comprehended what they were endeavoring to accomplish. "Restroom Gurgle" was recorded by the new joint effort and was discharged as a constrained release single in September 2007. 

The generation procedure for "Dream Black Channel" accumulated walk about December 2007. Late of the Pier more often than not continued by bringing room accounts into the studio, where they were refined by Alkan into "a progressively respectable bundle". They attempted flighty methods in the style of cutting edge maker Joe Meek amid the live studio recording sessions, incorporating stepping in showers and reamping guitars through air vents. At the point when tracks were blended in the wake of being recorded, the band individuals, Alkan, and designer Jimmy Robertson worked couple and consistently chosen when a track had wrapped up the studio impacts process. No melodies changed after this point, notwithstanding when one of the gatherings had further thoughts. At the time, in a meeting with the band, Stuart Turnbull of the BBC Collective showed that Alkan figured out how to "channel Late of the Pier's sonic assault into something increasingly centered yet still unquestionably extraordinary". 

The record was almost finished by end January 2008. Late of the Pier quit recording to set out on a featuring UK visit amid February, in which they saw new material. "The Bears Are Coming" was discharged as a vinyl single in March 2008. The band visited until the finish of April 2008 to advance another singleâa twofold A-side containing a revamped "Space and the Woods" and "Focker"â from the so far unreleased "Dream Black Channel". Studio work with Alkan restarted in May 2008 to put the completing addresses the collection; the last form was dedicated as "an assemblage of hits" and "hostile to pop". The collection was recorded amid a half year in various studios and the band individuals have conceded that the assortment in settings halfway clarifies why it sounds disconnected. Having a solitary 45-minute track rather than a track rundown of tunes was mooted toward the finish of May 2008, however was not finished. 

"Dream Black Channel's" track posting and UK CD discharge date of 11 August 2008 were affirmed on 11 June. Faley has asserted that "the collection became alright itself, similar to the melodies essentially disclosed to us where they needed to go on the collection". Late of the Pier picked the record's name indiscriminately after first considering utilizing "Peggy Patch and Her Sequenced Dress". The spread workmanship was structured by a companion of the band individuals from Brighton, Jon Bergman. A last EP containing material previously discharged in 2007 and 2008, "Echoclistel Lambietroy", was discharged in July 2008 as a major aspect of the promoting effort for the prospective collection. Potter has summed the record's origination by finishing up, "I think in the three years to develop to the collection, we never really thought of a track rundown, and we never extremely sort of considered the way that it should seem like a collection. I think we recorded every one of the melodies and after that they were there and it resembled, 'Gracious, we need to sort of line this together and make it seem like one piece.'" 

The composition procedure for "Dream Black Channel" was to a great extent spontaneous. The stanzas of "Broken" were considered late around evening time and are enlivened by a sleeping disorder. It required Eastgate a long investment to portray how he was feeling "in a way that sounded unique" for such a typical subject in popular music. The verses in the tune are about the first run through Late of the Pier headed to London and got lost. "Space and the Woods" endeavors to weigh up what is progressively imperative: an individual or a lifeless thing, or a nonappearance of anything, while "The Bears Are Coming" concerns "a quiet risk". The thought for the verse "A heartbeat, a glimmer, a line" in "Heartbeat" came to Eastgate while recording the melody and hearing its time signature continually evolving. 

The lyricist can't recollect stating "White Snake" and did not know there was a band of a similar name in presence. "Focker" developed out of a demo, called "6/8 Focker", Eastgate sang through a guitar amp with at first unintelligible verses. "The Enemy Are the Future" gets its name from a sentence in a limited time pamphlet for the outside the box musical crew The Enemy. Eastgate has clarified that for "Frantic Dogs and Englishmen" he haphazardly "yelled bunches of short expressions" and after that attempted to understand what he said. The procedure prompted stylised lines like "Falling over planes and needing to be an abandoned". 

"Dream Black Channel" is to a great extent based on sonic tests and the utilization of studio and PC strategies. The opening track, "Hot Tent Blues", is an instrumental short which contains seven layers of electric guitar go through a Zoom 506 low pitch guitar pedal. "Broken" was considered amid a jam session between Eastgate's guitar riffs and Dawson's drumming, while a demo of "Room and the Woods" like the Nirvana melody "All Apologies" was revamped and remixed in the studio. Eastgate credits Storm Mortimer, who used to drive Late of the Pier around London, as the dream for "The Bears Are Coming". She frequently sang extemporaneous and the frontman in the long run obtained a page of her tunes and added an afrobeat-roused cadence to it. Eastgate and Dawson needed to make a track that evoked "leaving the wilderness" and credit changed melodic acts like SlagsmÃ¥lsklubben, Prince, The Beatles, Mr Flash, FrYars, and Lutricia McNeal as motivation. 

"Irregular Firl" was one of Alkan's top picks and he convinced Late of the Pier to re-record it like an established bit of music instead of in a stone arranged manner. The vocal harmonies toward the finish of the tune were included amid one of the most recent long stretches of chronicle when the strain to finish the collection was high. "Heartbeat" depends on an old corrosive house demo track that Eastgate made amid his youth utilizing a Roland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer. The track highlights complex time signature movements and a guitar solo played by Potter on the sampler toward the end. "Whitesnake" was enlivened by the music of Devo, Roxy Music, and Dandi Wind, while "VW" depends on a 2001 demo recorded in Eastgate's loft. In the studio, Late of the Pier contracted metal players to play out the horn areas and make new scales. Once the instrumentals were recorded, the band individuals intentionally chose to blend their own playing lower in specific segments of the melody with the goal that audience members could hear the horns all the more unmistakably. 

"Focker" was made utilizing a circled riff from "6/8 Focker". Eastgate then imagined a drum solo and remixed and modified the most recent 20 seconds of the melody. "The Enemy Are the Future" was made amid a hungover jam session, where all band individuals played separately and not pair. Dawson performed around 40 unique beats in a steady progression all in various timings. The session was recorded utilizing a cassette deck and a track was formed in the studio. Four unique endings were recorded and three were grafted together toward the end. "Frantic Dogs and Englishmen", whose riff depends on an old French samba tune, was a result of a transaction between Eastgate on the guitar and Faley on the bass. The keep going track on the collection, "Restroom Gurgle", incorporates "a squelchy granulate of the riff" reason worked for the Liars Club group of onlookers amid the band's first historically speaking gigs. Eastgate has clarified, "I had these two topics, which circled round on one another which I sang exasperated Annie Lennox style vocals over." The quick beat of the main portion of the melody was compared against an area of "moderate show". 

Media reaction to "Dream Black Channel" was exceptionally good; conglomerating site Metacritic reports a standardized rating of 81% dependent on 18 basic audits. AllMusic's K. Ross Hoffman portrayed the collection as "great and electrifying" and named it "a tangled development packed with such huge numbers of promptly satisfying minutes that it takes different tunes in to remove them all". John Burgess of "The Guardian" clarified that another main tune, riff, or wayward minute can be discovered each time that the collection is tuned in to. Tim Chester of "NME" finished up, "It takes a specific sort of psyche to make this. While others whinge about living and biting the dust in circular drive towns shackled by parkway creative abilities, LOTP's vision is housed on Dubai's 'The World' island-creation venture." 

A few commentators grouped "Dream Black Channel" into the British new rave class and melodic scene. Others asserted that they could hear impressions of Roxy Music frontman Bryan Ferry and performer Gary Numan in the account. Pitchfork Media's Adam Moerder remarked that it contains a few new rave arrangements which are stylishly questionable. Chris Baynes of PopMatters guaranteed that the band individuals "wear their persuasions basically inked onto their sleeves", yet inferred that the collection is energizing and edgy in equivalent measure. As indicated by Late of the Pier, correlations with Klaxons and new rave are the consequences of apathetic news-casting, particularly for a scene the band has never been in. Eastgate has clarified that melodic impacts are frequently subliminal, despite the fact that the band individuals made an effort not to tune in to anything besides rather their own work while recording the collection. Scratch Mitchell of "The Skinny" called attention to that the record is "an excessive, unclassifiable, out of the blue triumphant cavort through booming impacts and types, from the 70s camp shake of Queen and Bowie to the crude gadgets of Gary Numan, with echoes of 90s PC diversions and grabs of current house".
