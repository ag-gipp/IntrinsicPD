This enabled the Norman Cob to remain moderately the equivalent as the decades progressed, while other draft breeds were becoming heavier and slower because of choice for meat. Between the 1990s, the studbook experienced a few changes, and during the 1980s, hereditary investigations were played out that demonstrated the breed experienced inbreeding and hereditary float.

The Norman Cob originates from the Normandy locale of France, a zone known for its pony reproducing. Normandy is additionally the home of two different breeds, the Percheron and the French Trotter. Both of these breeds are preferred known over the Norman Cob, despite the fact that the last is famous in its home locale. The name "cob" originates from the English and Welsh cobs that it looks like, with the expansion of "Norman" to allude to the territory in which it began. Albeit by and large considered an individual from the draft horse gathering, the Norman Cob is unique among French draft breeds. It has been utilized solely for the generation of game steeds, and has not been widely utilized for the creation of meat, not at all like numerous other French draft breeds. This implies its adaptation has remained generally unaltered, instead of being reared for heavier loads for butchering. 

The first ponies in Normandy and Brittany were little steeds called "bidets", presented by the Celts. The Romans crossed these ponies with bigger female horses, and starting in the tenth century, these "Norman steeds" were wanted all through Europe. Amid the sixteenth century, Norman steeds were known to be overwhelming and solid, ready to pull long separations, and used to pull cannons and constancies. Thorn and Arabian blood was included amid the rule of Louis XIV. The Norman Cob is plummeted from this Norman pony, called the .

The Norman steed Thoroughbred crossbreds created at these studs were isolated into two gatherings. The first were lighter mounted force ponies, and the second were heavier steeds, called "cobs", utilized for draft work in the district. As of now, there was no breed vault or studbook; rather, specific rearing was drilled by the two studs, and ranchers tried the abilities of youthful steeds to choose reproducing stock. 

At the earliest reference point of the twentieth century, the was viewed as the best carriage steeds accessible. The landing of cars, and comparing decrease popular for carriage steeds, concurred with a split in the breed. A refinement was made between the lighter, quicker steeds in the breed, utilized for game, and bigger ponies, utilized for farming work.
