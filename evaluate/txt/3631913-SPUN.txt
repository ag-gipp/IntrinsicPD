Amid his profession, he won twelve Australian Championships. 

At first prepared by his mom, Kerry delighted in achievement in swimming and surf lifesaving as a youngster. His swimming vocation advanced to senior Australian gauges after he changed to the tutelage of John Rigby and moved to Queensland. He made his introduction at the 1976 Australian Championships and speedily won the 200Â m free-form and backstroke occasions to win choice for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal at 16 years old. At the Olympics, Kerry achieved the last in two occasions, coming seventh and fifth in the 100Â m and 200Â m backstroke separately. Kerry was baffled with his exhibitions, however they pulled in the consideration of American mentor Doc Counsilman, who welcomed Kerry to swim under him at the Indiana University. Kerry set Australian records while in the United States, however his worldwide profession hit inconvenience when he was removed from the 1978 Commonwealth Games group for breaking a time limitation. 

Kerry came back to Australia in 1980 for the national titles and picked up determination for the Moscow Olympics by winning the backstroke twofold. Kerry declined monetary affectations and opposed political weight from the administration of Australia to blacklist the Olympics in challenge at the Soviet attack of Afghanistan. He proceeded to win bronze in the 200Â m backstroke subsequent to missing the last in the 100Â m. The pinnacle of his vocation came in the 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m variety transfer, where he begun the triumphant group. The race remains the main time that the United States did not win the occasion at the Olympics. After the amusements, Kerry enjoyed an all-encompassing reprieve from the game, before returning for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He guaranteed a bronze in the variety transfer and came fifth in the 100Â m backstroke. He at that point resigned and took up a TV and demonstrating vocation in the United States. In the wake of coming back to Australia, he ran and claimed Dunhill Management, one of the biggest selecting firms in the country, with his sibling. In 2001, the Kerry siblings sold Dunhill for , with up to A$13.8Â million in extra installments relying upon the accomplishment of the organization. They later established another enlistment firm, K2. 

Conceived in Temora, New South Wales, close to the territorial focus of Wagga, Kerry was one of two children destined to a vehicle sales rep. Kerry's mom was a swimming educator who ran her own oceanic school. Kerry was instructed to swim by his mom, whom he viewed as a fussbudget who accentuated method and swung him to backstroke. Kerry grew up taking an interest in a wide scope of games, speaking to Wollongong High School in tennis, games and swimming. He additionally contended multiple times in the state crosscountry titles. When his family had moved to the coastline city of Wollongong, Kerry built up an affection for the surf. He found the sea water significantly more energizing because of its capriciousness. Kerry relentlessly ascended through the surf lifesaving positions, contending at the state and national titles. In 1974, Kerry won the Cadet Malibu occasion in the Australian Championships, and in 1975 he came next in the surf race at the Australian Open Surfing Championships. In the pool, Kerry had his first focused race at 12 years old in 1971. At the time, Brad Cooperâwho proceeded to win the 400Â m free-form at the 1972 Summer Olympicsâwas living in Wollongong and he and Kerry prepared together all the time. In 1974, Kerry contended in the Australian Age Championships in free-form, before moving north to prepare with John Rigby in Brisbane, Queensland in the next year. At the season of his turn, Kerry was positioned around 200th on the planet in backstroke. 

Kerry had improved to such a degree, that by November 1975, his occasions in the 200Â m backstroke had dropped from around 2Â m 10Â s to around 2Â m 3.0Â s, positioning him third on the planet. Because of his solid exhibitions in the pool, Kerry resigned from surf hustling. Kerry made his introduction at the 1976 Australian Championships, winning the 200Â m free-form and backstroke occasions in 1Â m 54.33Â s and 2Â m 3.58Â s individually, just as the 4Â ÃÂ 200Â m free-form and the 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m mixture transfers for New South Wales, beginning both transfers. Matured 16, Kerry won determination for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal in the 100Â m and 200Â m backstroke, the 200Â m free-form, the 4Â ÃÂ 200Â m free-form hand-off and the 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m variety hand-off. 

Kerry was second in his warmth of the 200Â m free-form heat in a period of 1Â m 54.86Â s, yet was four seconds off the pace and did not fit the bill for the last. His time was 2.08Â s behind the slowest qualifier, putting him sixteenth. Kerry did not get the opportunity to swim in the 4Â ÃÂ 200Â m free-form hand-off. The quickest Australian in the comparing singular occasion, he was refreshed in the passing round; Australia came third in their warmth and ninth generally to miss the last by 1.88Â s after Peter Dawson swam his split in a period four seconds slower than Kerry's exertion in the individual occasion. Had Kerry rehashed his individual time in the hand-off instead of Dawson, Australia would have qualified fifth. 

Kerry discovered more achievement in the 100Â m backstroke, winning his warmth in 57.99Â s to qualify third quickest for the elimination rounds. He at that point scratched into the last as the second slowest qualifier, in the wake of coming fourth in his elimination round in a period of 58.04Â s. His season of 57.94Â s put him seventh in the last, in front of individual Australian Mark Tonelli, however over two seconds behind the successful John Naber of the United States. In the 200Â m occasion, Kerry put in an individual best time of 2Â m 3.58Â s in the principal warmth to qualify fourth quickest for the last, yet swam slower in the decider to complete fifth in a period of 2Â m 4.07Â s, one spot behind Tonelli and 2.72Â s far from bronze. Kerry joined with Paul Jarvie, Neil Rogers and Peter Coughlan in the 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m mixture hand-off, putting 6th. The group of four qualified in 6th spot, and Kerry had them in fourth spot subsequent to posting a period of 57.94Â s in the primary leg, yet his partners were unfit to stay aware of the pioneers and completed over four seconds out of award conflict. 

Kerry was baffled with his exhibitions, feeling that he had neglected to perform to his potential in the midst of the weight and fervor of an Olympics. In any case, he felt that his experience of hustling against any semblance of Naber and Roland Matthes would hold him in great stead. On a more brilliant note, Kerry's exhibitions awed the main American mentor Doc Counsilman, who welcomed him to come and swim at Indiana University after Kerry completed his auxiliary tutoring in Australia. Kerry effectively protected his 200Â m backstroke national title in 1977, however the time was over four seconds slower than his exertion in the earlier year. He joined with his New South Wales partners to win every one of the three transfers, again in times considerably slower than in the previous Olympic year. The exhibitions earned him choice for the Australian group for the Coca-Cola Meet in London, however Kerry felt that he needed inspiration after the Olympics. After returning, he chose to missing himself from such occasions. 

In January 1978, Kerry landed at Indiana University, examining theater, show and media communications. In light of the occasions that he recorded for Indiana, Kerry was named in the Australian squad for the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Canada. Be that as it may, his global profession gave off an impression of being in chaos when alongside two colleagues, Tonelli and Joe Dixon, he was removed from the Australian group for breaking a check in time on American Independence Day amid a preparation camp in Honolulu, Hawaii. As per Tonelli, Kerry was late in light of the fact that he was pursuing a female he had met, while Tonelli and Dixon had been drinking. Tonelli likewise admitted to the authorities that he had smoked maryjaneânot illicit under Hawaii lawâon the night. In the fallout of the occurrence, Tonelli showed up on Australian TV, firmly denying gossipy tidbits that he had been engaged with a medication fuelled bash with colleagues. He confessed to smoking maryjane, yet safeguarded his activities, saying that it was not unlawful. Supporters in Australia, including future Prime Minister Bob Hawke, propelled an appeal for the reestablishment of the trio, which gathered a large number of marks, yet without much of any result. 

Kerry came back to Indiana and proceeded with his preparation. He contended at the 1979 U.S. National Championships at Fort Lauderdale, setting Australian records in the 100Â m and 200Â m backstroke in the midst of 56.50Â s and 2Â m 2.61Â s individually. After some time, Kerry turned out to be progressively malcontented with Counsilman, who he felt was losing center and getting to be distracted with different business responsibilities and an endeavor to swim over the English Channel. Kerry exchanged to the University of Southern California, which was trained by Naber's guide Peter Daland. 

Kerry returned home to contend in the 1980 Australian Championships, winning both backstroke occasions, yet in a slower time than his Australian records. Kerry included two titles as an individual from the 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m mixture and free-form hand-off groups for New South Wales. This earned Kerry his second outing to the Olympics, this time in Moscow. In any case, another snag emerged with the Soviet intrusion of Afghanistan, which brought about a blacklist of the Games by a vast piece of the Western world, driven by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was additionally the supporter of the Australian Olympic Committee, and huge political weight came to hold up under on the competitors to blacklist the Games. Kerry's colleague Tonelli, in any case, understood that just the sportspeople would experience the ill effects of a blacklist and that exchange relations would proceed with unabated. He played an influential position among the competitors to battle for their entitlement to contend. Kerry was similarly resolved that he would contend, dissimilar to some different swimmers who made individual blacklists. He got offers from Australian government authorities to blacklist the Games as a byproduct of budgetary installments. He stated: 

After leaving the US for the Olympics, Kerry was undermined with the abrogation of his US visa. Kerry touched base in Moscow confronting a four occasion plan: he was selected in both backstroke occasions and the 4Â ÃÂ 200Â m free-form hand-off and the 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m mixture transfer. With the Americans and numerous other western swimmers missing, Australian authorities were certain that their three participants in the 100Â m backstroke, Kerry, Tonelli and Glenn Patching, would all make the last and win decorations. Kerry came third in the two his warmth and semi-last, timing 58.07Â s separately, passing up the last by simply 0.02Â s. He was the ninth quickest in the intently run elimination rounds, with the third quickest qualifier being just 0.18Â s quicker. Fixing missed the last subsequent to slipping on the beginning divider in his race, while Tonelli proceeded to complete seventh. Had Kerry coordinated his own best of 65.50Â s, he would have won the gold decoration in front of Sweden's Bengt Baron. 

Kerry bobbed, thinking back to the 200Â m backstroke and won his warmth to qualify third-quickest, before asserting bronze in a period of 2Â m 3.14Â s behind the Hungarian couple of SÃ¡ndor WladÃ¡r and ZoltÃ¡n VerrasztÃ³. He pushed out the Soviet Union's Vladimir Shemetov by 0.34Â s, turning into the principal Australian to win a decoration in an individual backstroke occasion since David Theile in 1960. In the 4Â ÃÂ 200Â m free-form transfer, he joined with Tonelli, Graeme Brewer and Ron McKeon as Australia came seventh in the wake of qualifying fourth. The Australians were 6th at the midpoint when Kerry bounced in for the third leg. Kerry moved Australia into fifth before the finish of his leg, only 0.78Â s from the bronze award position, subsequent to posting a split time of 1Â m 52.64Â s, the eighteenth quickest split in the race. Notwithstanding, McKeon couldn't keep pace with the restriction grapple swimmers, and Australia completed seventh, 1.52Â s outside the awards. 

The 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m mixture hand-off was the point of convergence of Kerry's Moscow battle. The occasion had dependably been won by the United States since its origin at Olympic dimension in 1960, and their blacklist had opened up the field in the occasion. In the multiple times the occasion had been challenged, Australia's best outcome was a silver in the debut race. A bronze in 1964 was the main other decoration achievement and the 1976 version of the mixture hand-off had seen Australia disposed of in the warms. This time, Australia was viewed as an award possibility, yet was not seen as the principle dangersâSweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union were viewed as the in all likelihood champs. The hosts' group incorporated the silver medallists in the 100Â m backstroke and breaststroke, and their butterflyer had come fifth; their freestyler would later place fourth. The British had Duncan Goodhew, the breaststroke gold medallist, while Sweden's butterflyer and backstroker had won their individual occasions and their free-form swimmer would come next in the 100Â m. Australia's group failed to measure up on paper. Neil Brooks, the freestyler, later came fourteenth by and large in the wake of having an asthma assault, and Peter Evans was the main individual medallist in the relating singular occasion. Kerry had been disposed of in the backstroke elimination rounds, while Tonelli was swimming as a stopgap butterflyer, notwithstanding having performed superior to Kerry in the 100Â m backstroke. Adding to the weight was the way that Australia won no gold decorations at the 1976 Olympics in any game, and were yet to win in Moscow, so the open were all the while anticipating their first triumph since Munich in 1972. Coming into the Olympics, Australia were positioned seventh out of the thirteen contending nations. 

Australia's prospects improved after the morning warms in which Sweden was excluded. Tonelli, the oldest swimmer in the group of four at 23 years old, gathered the group as its "true" pioneer. He requested that his colleagues focus on swimming their legs in a specific time; Kerry pledged to swim the backstroke in 57Â s, Evans the breaststroke in 63Â s level, Tonelli the butterfly in 54Â s and Brooks guaranteed to stay the group in 49.8Â s, despite the fact that he had never gone quicker than 51Â s. Tonelli named the foursome as the Quietly Confident Quartet, and they showed a calm certainty as they arranged for the race. 

As Patching had slipped before in the meet, Kerry chose to rub a sticky red substance onto the bottoms of his feet. The Soviet hosts had introduced a floor covering following the episodes, bringing about Kerry leaving red impressions in the arena. Kerry begun in a period quicker than his exertion in the individual occasion, yet it was as yet two seconds slower than his own best time of 57.87Â s, leaving Australia in fourth spot toward the finish of the primary leg. Evans at that point swam an individual best of 63.01Â s, drawing Australia practically level with the host country at the midway imprint. Tonelli swam his leg in 54.94Â s, right around two seconds quicker than he had done over the separation. Tonelli did as such with an uneven arm system because of the uneven quality in his arms. He started to lose ground in the last 50Â m and was a bodylength behind until a late flood brought him to inside a meter before the finish of his leg. Rivulets at that point executed an amazing, all around planned plunge and surfaced practically even with his Soviet partner. He had drawn dimension by the midway imprint and made a better turn than lead the pack. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25Â m imprint before Brooks again dashed away to seal an Australian triumph by 0.22Â s. Rivulets had completed his leg in 49.86Â s as he had promised to his partners. The season of 3Â m 45.70Â s fixed Australia's first since forever win in a variety hand-off at the Olympics, for men or ladies. The group at that point made a celebratory plunge into the pool and were met poolside. In 2000, Kerry and different individuals from the group of four were each granted the Australian Sports Medal for their triumph in Moscow. 

After the Olympics, Kerry enjoyed an all-encompassing reprieve from focused swimming. He was approached to return for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, so he made a rebound, however just completed two weeks of strong preparing and missed determination, neglecting to win both of the backstroke occasions. In 1983, he started planning for the Olympics, however did not begin genuine work until October. Kerry was certain about his capacity to perform at universal guidelines with sporadic readiness after long vacations. He credited this to his method and capacity to keep his 190Â cm, 80Â kg body fit as a fiddle while not preparing. 

He came back to Australia in 1984 and in the wake of preparing in Brisbane, he was chosen for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles regardless of winning neither backstroke occasion at the Australian Championships. Landing in the United States, Kerry was planned to contend in the 100Â m backstroke and 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m mixture transfer. Kerry swam rapidly to win his warmth in the 100Â m in a period of 57.15Â s, qualifying third quickest for the last. Be that as it may, he was unfit to improve his pace in the last, completing fifth in a period of 57.18Â s, 0.69Â s from the bronze decoration. In the mixture transfer, Kerry and Evans joined Glenn Buchanan and Mark Stockwell, who swam the butterfly and free-form individually. They were no counterpart for the Americans, who had three of the four gold medallists in the relating singular occasions and completed very nearly four seconds ahead. Kerry had Australia in third spot at the primary change, completing his leg in a period of 57.12Â s, yet by this point the Americans were at that point 1.71Â s ahead. Australia stayed third at each change and were beaten continuously put Canadians by simply 0.02Â s. 

After the Games, Kerry resigned from focused swimming. He at that point worked in Los Angeles as a model and facilitated a design appear on digital TV. As indicated by Tonelli, Kerry's mom revealed to her child to "care for that face, [because] that is all you have". Tonelli deviated, opining that "he was in every case substantially more than that". Tonelli announced that Kerry was occupied with dressing himself just before the beginning of their Olympic-winning hand-off execution, guaranteeing that despite the fact that Australia was probably not going to win the race, he expected to look great in light of the fact that a forthcoming business may watch. Kerry proceeded to demonstrate on the catwalks of Milan and Paris. 

Kerry wedded his American spouse Lynda, and they split their time among Australia and the United States. They have two kids, a child Tanner who is a semi-proficient b-ball player, and a little girl Madison, who is an on-screen character showing up on Home and Away. Alongside his sibling Phil, Kerry established Dunhill Management, one of Australia's biggest enlisting firms. In 2001, the siblings sold Dunhill to the British firm Robert Walters for A$22.7Â million, with up to A$13.8Â million in additional installments relying upon the future accomplishment of the organization. After this, Kerry filled in as the overseeing executive of another firm, before beginning another enlistment business with his sibling, K2 Recruitment and Consulting.
