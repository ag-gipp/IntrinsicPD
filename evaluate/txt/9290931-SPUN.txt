Edmonds was established in 1876 and got its first railroad in 1891, developed by the Seattle and Montana Railroad among Seattle and British Columbia. The Great Northern Railway later procured the railroad and finished its cross-country course to Seattle in 1893, conveying long-remove traveler administration to Edmonds. The first station was situated on the west side of the tracks from downtown and mocked as out of reach and undersized for the developing city. A formal examination of stations crosswise over Snohomish County by the Washington State Railroad Commission in 1909 prompted a court request for Great Northern to improve their stops, including a modernized office for Edmonds at James Street, which the railroad opposed in their fizzled intrigue to the state court. Incredible Northern later consented to manufacture the new warehouse after further interview with Edmonds city pioneers over its area and conveniences. Later visits by the commission pulled in hordes of up to a hundred natives, and the city consented to an option to proceed establishment with Great Northern for the new warehouse in January 1910. The railroad and city kept on argueing over the proposed terminal's separation from James Street until the council of trade mediated and mentioned a trade off be come to. 

The new Edmonds stop opened in November 1910, developed with clapboard sidings and had a wooden stage that was associated with road level by a progression of inclines, which were later finished with railroad knickknacks. It was at first served by eight day by day traveler trains: constrained cross-country trains and nearby administration to Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia. Cargo administrations from the new terminal additionally acknowledged shipments from the Olympic Peninsula, conveyed by pontoon from different shingle plants. By the late 1950s, Great Northern's declining traveler administration left Edmonds with just a single every day train: the "Cascadian" from Seattle to Spokane. 

In March 1956, Great Northern reported designs to fabricate a cutting edge station in Edmonds to serve the rural regions north of Seattle, at an expense of $185,000. The new station would incorporate a 175-slow down parking area, a blacktop stage, and a streamlined lounge area with contemporary plan components. Development of the new station building started in May 1956 and was generously finished before the finish of November. The previous warehouse was devastated on December 18, 1956, and the close total station was put into administration before the month's over. It was devoted on January 2, 1957, and the primary cross-country "Realm Builder" train to stop at Edmonds landed on January 7, welcomed by a horde of 1,000 inhabitants and city pioneers from over the locale, including Secretary of State Earl Coe. 

In March 1970, Great Northern was converged with three other real railways into the Burlington Northern Railroad, which kept on working traveler administration for one year. In November, the central government built up Railpax (later Amtrak) to solidify unrewarding cross-country traveler benefits recently worked by contending railways. The six traveler trains serving Edmonds were disposed of or rerouted somewhere else under the Railpax plan; the last "Domain Builder" train left from Edmonds on the evening of April 30, 1971. The station stayed open as a Burlington Northern cargo stop and kept up by the railroad with expectations of reestablished traveler administration. Traveler trains to Edmonds station restored a year later on July 17, 1972, with the reestablished "Pacific International" among Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia. Cross-country administration to Edmonds returned on June 13, 1973, by means of an augmentation of the "North Coast Hiawatha" over Stevens Pass, and was enhanced by the rerouted "Realm Builder" in 1981. Amtrak dropped the "North Coast Hiawatha" in 1979 and "Pacific International" in 1981 because of poor support and ticket deals, leaving Edmonds with just two every day train takeoffs. Edmonds was slated to lose its ticketing office and baggage carousel in 1983 as a component of national slices to stations with low ridership, however was saved by Amtrak in light of an expansion in ticket income. 

The Seattleâ Vancouver hall was assigned as a need rapid rail passage by the United States Department of Transportation in 1992. Reestablishment of traveler rail administration to Vancouver was upheld by Congressman Al Swift, who campaigned for its consideration in the national transportation spending plan, alongside a commitment from Washington state. The restored administration would require raised speed constrains through Edmonds, which was contradicted by inhabitants and the city committee in a question that started in the late 1980s. The raised speed limits were endorsed by a regulatory law judge, against the city's desires, and new fences were slated to be worked along the railroad utilizing city licenses. The grants remained unapproved toward the beginning of May 1995, just weeks before administration was booked to start, and Amtrak took steps to skip Edmonds station until they were issued. An understanding was marked by Amtrak and Edmonds, taking into consideration prepares on the "Mount Baker International" to utilize the station starting May 25, 1995. The train was later collapsed into the Amtrak "Falls" brand presented in January 1999. 

Related to the Amtrak "Falls" program, the regional's legislature proposed the advancement of a multimodal community for Amtrak, suburbanite rail, transports, and ships to supplant separate offices in downtown Edmonds. The multimodal venture, named "Edmonds Crossing", was assessed during the 1990s and a favored area on part of a neglected Unocal fuel terminal at Point Edwards, toward the southwest of downtown, was picked in 1998. The multimodal center would incorporate a rail station with 570 parking spots imparted to ship clients, just as a transport terminal. 

The Edmonds Crossing plan included arrangements for a between time suburbanite rail station in downtown Edmonds, to be worked by the new local travel expert (later renamed Sound Transit). The travel expert ran a pilot worker rail administration to Seattle in mid 1995, ceasing at Everett and Edmonds, to advance a $6.7 billion travel plan that would be put on a provincial ticket measure in March. The poll measure was dismissed by voters, however a $3.9 billion arrangement was affirmed in the November 1996 race, including a worker rail line from Everett to Seattle and $6 million in subsidizing for an Edmonds station on hold. The Amtrak station was chosen by Sound Transit as the site of the between time station in 2000 and the regional government endorsed a fifteen-year plan for the interval station in 2002. The suburbanite rail line was initially planned to start administration in 2001, yet was postponed because of exchanges with the Federal Transit Administration and BNSF Railway, the successor to Burlington Northern. The break station in Edmonds incorporated an all-inclusive stage and new parking garage on the south side of the Amtrak office, both situated on property obtained from BNSF. Sounder worker rail administration from Everett and Edmonds started on December 21, 2003. 

The last natural effect explanation for the Edmonds Crossing venture was distributed in 2004 and got a Record of Decision the next year, however came up short on a financing source. Locale of the $171 million venture was exchanged to Washington State Ferries in 2007, yet the ship framework rather organized fix and substitution of vessels over capital undertakings, and declared in 2009 that the Edmonds Crossing task would be left unfunded for a 20-year time span. Subsidizing for the changeless Edmonds station had been endorsed in the Sound Transit 2 gone by voters in 2008 and was booked to start development in the late spring of 2009. Because of the wiping out of the Edmonds Crossing venture, the Edmonds City Council mentioned the assisted structure and development of a lasting Sounder station. 

Development of the perpetual Sounder station started in July 2010, after understandings marked by Sound Transit and the regional government, and a formal earth shattering was held in August. The $12.9 million undertaking incorporated the development of another stage, four traveler holding up asylums, another travel focus, improved lighting, and repaving of the parking areas. The new stage was opened on July 9, 2011, and was trailed by the opening of the travel focus in October. As a component of the venture, the quantity of parking spots for suburbanite rail clients was decreased from 200 to 161. An extra 53 parking spots were opened for Sounder travelers in November 2012, rented from the private Waterfront Antique Mall while another part with 103 spaces was constructed and rented to Sound Transit. Feasible arrangements call for twofold following of the railroad through Edmonds and a second stage at Edmonds station, situated toward the west along Railroad Avenue.

The station is likewise served by the North Line of Sound Transit's Sounder suburbanite rail administration on weekdays, running four trains in pinnacle bearing towards King Street Station in Seattle amid the regular drive and four trains from Seattle amid the night drive. Sounder trains likewise keep running on select ends of the week amid exceptional occasions. 

The station likewise fills in as the end of five Community Transit courses, including throughout the day neighborhood courses to close-by regions in Lynnwood, Mountlake Terrace, and Shoreline, and pinnacle worker administration to downtown Seattle.
