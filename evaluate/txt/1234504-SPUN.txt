Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway 

The Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway (CL&N) was a nearby traveler and cargo conveying railroad in the southwestern piece of the U.S. territory of Ohio, interfacing Cincinnati to Dayton by means of Lebanon. It was worked in the late nineteenth century to give the town of Lebanon and Warren County better transportation offices. The railroad was privately known as the "Good country Route", since it pursued the edge between the Little and Great Miami streams, and was the main line not influenced by floods, for example, the Great Dayton Flood of 1913. 

The line was finished in 1881, and the CL&N was shaped in 1885. The organization experienced different insolvencies until the Pennsylvania Railroad picked up control in 1896. CL&N proceeded with its very own activities until 1921, and existed until 1926, when the parent organization combined CL&N and other littler organizations. With the exception of quite a while in the mid-1880s, when the line was leveled out of the tight measure Toledo, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad, it was anything but a noteworthy line, to a limited extent because of its precarious way to deal with downtown Cincinnati. Hence, bits of the line have been deserted, start in 1952 with a fragment north of Lebanon. 

Traveler administration was disposed of totally in 1934. Conrail, the Pennsylvania Railroad's successor, sold the remaining trackage during the 1980s to the Indiana and Ohio Railway, a short line currently possessed by RailAmerica. That organization keeps on giving neighborhood cargo administration on the ex-CL&N, and the Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad works traveler prepares on a part of the line close Lebanon. 

The town of Lebanon, Ohio, spread out in 1802, was circumvent by the Miami and Erie Canal in 1830; the branch Warren County Canal to Lebanon was destroyed by flooding in 1848. The Little Miami Railroad (1846, later a Pennsylvania line) and Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad (1851, later a B&O line) pursued the valleys of the Little and Great Miami waterways (the M&E Canal had utilized the last mentioned), likewise bypassing the good countries on which Lebanon lay. Inhabitants of the town acquired an authoritative contract in March 1850 for the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Xenia Railroad (CL&X), which would reach out from Cincinnati upper east through Lebanon to Xenia. At the last town, the incorporators chose the in all likelihood association would be the New York and Erie Railroad, which was anticipating reaching out into Ohio. In this manner the line was intended to utilize the Erie's expansive measure. 

To enter the city of Cincinnati, the CL&X would join the Dayton and Cincinnati Railroad (D&C), which was arranging the twofold track Deer Creek Tunnel through the Walnut Hills, at Sharonville (at that point known as Sharon). Passage development started in late 1852, and the CL&X was at last composed under the contract in November. The CL&X found option to proceed, and started development in about April 1853, yet was compelled to stop work before the finish of 1855 because of absence of assets. Just reviewing among Sharon and Lebanon, generally north of Mason, had been finished. (The passage venture likewise fizzled, and was in the end procured by the CL&N.) In July 1861, the courts selected a recipient for the CL&X, who in March 1869 sold the incomplete railroad, which had cost $83,885, to 40 territory occupants for $4,000. Five trustees would guarantee that the property was not sold without a greater part of its proprietors consenting. Twenty years after its channel association was crushed, Lebanon was still without a cutting edge association with the outside world, and its economy kept on stagnating. 

The 1870s prevailing fashion of the thin measure railroad, which was less expensive than more extensive checks to construct and work (for low volumes of traffic), displayed another plausibility. The Dayton and South Eastern Railroad (D&SE, later a B&O line) was arranging a thin measure line from the Jackson County mines through Xenia to Dayton, and a branch from Xenia through Lebanon would interface with the business sectors at Cincinnati. The editors of the neighborhood paper, "The Western Star", urged natives to help the venture, yet by playing a progressively dynamic job and sorting out a privately claimed railroad organization to guarantee its finishing. Publications compared the circumstance to Aesop's tale of Hercules and the Carter, where Hercules tells a stuck carter that he won't help except if the carter himself is eager to help. In November 1874, occupants of Lebanon and the encompassing territory sorted out the limited check Miami Valley Narrow Gauge Railway (renamed Miami Valley Railway in October 1876), which would total the incomplete CL&X as a part of the D&SE. 

Moderate stock memberships postponed looking over until June 1875, when a line was situated among Xenia and the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad (M&C, later a B&O line) west of Norwood. Property proprietors in the towns of Norwood and Pleasant Ridge, wishing to build up their territory as rural areas, set forward a suggestion to move the line toward the east through their territory in return with the expectation of complimentary option to proceed, and to fabricate a steam sham line among Norwood and the pony vehicle lines in Walnut Hills, which would give Miami Valley travelers a more straightforward access to downtown Cincinnati than the winding M&C. Be that as it may, in August, a much more straightforward course south of Norwood, through the tough Deer Creek Valley, was proposed, by which the Miami Valley could get its very own entrance to Cincinnati. In the wake of forcing substantial confinements, which would require the development of a few trestles and a passage, the Cincinnati City Council conceded the option to proceed through the valley, including Eden Park, to the railroad organization. The proprietors of the old CL&X grade sold it in April 1876 for $8,000 in supply of the new organization, and a large portion of the land outside Cincinnati had been purchased by that mid year. The Miami Valley settled in May 1876 to assemble just north to Waynesville, a town southwest of Xenia, where the anticipated Waynesville, Port William and Jeffersonville Railroad and Jeffersonville, Mt. Sterling and Columbus Railroad would reach out to Columbus, crossing the D&SE at Octa. (The previous finished the vast majority of its line, however deserted it in 1887; the last was just ready to review a segment.) 

President Seth S. Haines of Waynesville kicked things off in Eden Park on September 1, 1876, albeit most early work was done outside Cincinnati. The organization kept on being tormented by absence of assets, and, in spite of consummation of the evaluation among Norwood and Waynesville inside a year, work before long hindered and in the long run halted in late 1878. Contractual worker John B. Benedict acquired a suit December for rupture of agreement, charging that he was not legitimately paid. Amid the preliminary, two humiliating actualities became exposed: Haines and Benedict had marked a "mystery contract" giving Haines a segment of the bonds paid to Benedict, and the cost of the line south of Norwood had been misleadingly swelled with the goal that the interfacing Cincinnati and Eastern Railway (C&E, later a N&W line) would need to pay more for trackage rights into Cincinnati. Be that as it may, it was delinquency of enthusiasm on bonds that constrained the Miami Valley into receivership in January and dispossession in March 1880. One more decade had passed Lebanon still come up short on a railroad. 

The Toledo, Delphos and Burlington Railroad (TD&B), a developing restricted check framework with roots in the town of Delphos, would at long last give Lebanon its rail line. Together with a gathering of rural Cincinnati speculators, the TD&B purchased the incomplete evaluation at the abandonment deal for $61,000 and fused the restricted check Cincinnati Northern Railway as its successor on June 8, 1880. (The TD&B would likewise procure the Dayton and South Eastern in February 1881.) At first the TD&B and Cincinnati-region inhabitants shared stock and the board similarly, yet soon this was changed with the goal that the previous party would control all the stock for simplicity in future union, and the last would locally deal with the street. As the TD&B was incorporating with Dayton from the north, it was chosen that the new organization would not utilize the evaluation right to Waynesville. Rather, the TD&B would develop an association from the D&SE at a point they called Lebanon Junction, presently inside Dayton close to the convergence of Woodman and Rainier Drives, to the little town of Dodds. There the Cincinnati Northern would start, following the Miami Valley's course through Lebanon to Cincinnati. Development continued in late 1880, and continued quickly on account of financing from Ohio and Northeastern industrialists. Blended train activities among Lebanon and Norwood, where associations could be made with the M&C, started on May 30, 1881, and on September 5 the line was opened south to a streetcar association at Oak Street, only north of the passage. Administration was stretched out through the passage to the Eden Park entrance on January 12, 1882, and on February 13 an impermanent Cincinnati stop opened only north of Court Street. With the culmination of the TD&B's branch from Lebanon Junction to Dodds in December 1881, the Cincinnati-Dayton line was at long last total; Jackson County coal was first delivered over it in February 1882. Two short branches to suburbia of Montgomery and Avondaleâthe last fabricated independently as the Spring Grove, Avondale and Cincinnati Railway (SGA&C)â opened on November 14, 1881 and July 1, 1882, separately. C&E activities to Court Street started by April 1882, utilizing the Cincinnati Northern south of an intersection at Idlewild, and in October the Cincinnati Northern laid tracks over that road into its lasting warehouse at the southeast corner of the Broadway Street convergence. 

The TD&B assimilated its backup, the Toledo, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad (TC&StL), in March 1882, and accepting its name as progressively spellbinding of the developing framework, which planned to turn out to be a piece of an across the nation thin measure arrange extending southwest to Mexico City. After one year, in May 1883, the Cincinnati Northern and the SGA&C were merged into the TC&StL. Be that as it may, the TC&StL was developed economically, with poor seepage and little stabilizer. While the Cincinnati Northern had been worked to better benchmarks, the associating line between Lebanon Junction and Dodds was similarly as awful. The deficient offices and hardware, just as troubles in trading gear with lines, added to its entering receivership in August 1883. The TC&StL had six divisions as of now. Four of the five TC&StL divisions south of Delphos were sold to their bondholders at sale in June 1884, and separate organizations were before long composed for three of those: the Dayton and Toledo Railroad, Dayton and Ironton Railroad, and Iron Railway (named "Iron Railroad" preceding TC&StL receivership). The Toledo-St. Louis line was sold in December 1885 and redesigned as the Toledo, St. Louis and Kansas City Railroad, normally known as the Clover Leaf Route. In July, George Hafer of Avondale supplanted William J. Craig of Toledo as collector of the Cincinnati Northern Division, enabling it to recuperate from Craig's conceded support. Hafer got a momentary rent from the trustees of the Dodds-Lebanon Junction line (formally the Cincinnati Division), enabling proceeded with access to Dayton. At long last, on June 27, 1885, the Cincinnati Northern Division was sold for $200,000 to its bondholders, who consolidated the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway, with Hafer as president, on July 14 and exchanged tasks on August 1, 1885. The thin measure development of the 1870s had fizzled, and the majority of the ex-TC&StL lines were changed over to standard check inside the following ten years. 

The recently composed CL&N at first worked a fundamental line from Court Street in Cincinnati to Dayton, renting the track from Dodds to Lebanon Junction from the Cincinnati Division trustees, and trackage rights over the Dayton and Ironton Railroad (the old limited check D&SE line) into Dayton. In any case, the last was changed over to in April 1887, and CL&N administration was decreased to Dodds, since the activities north of there were unrewarding notwithstanding when it had the capacity to achieve Dayton. (The line from Lebanon to Dodds was rented in 1892 to the organization sorted out to work north of Dodds.) Avondale Branch activities were suspended in August 1889, because of rivalry from the less expensive Mt. Coppery Cable Railway. Under Hafer's administration, new traveler and cargo terminals opened on the north side of Court Street in December 1885. In anticipation of change to standard measure, the CL&N relaid rail and supplanted spans, incorporating a straight trestle in the Deer Creek Valley, finished in January 1889, instead of a bending old restricted check structure. The principal standard check rails were laid by August 1889 as a component of a double measure setup south of Idlewild, when the Ohio and North Western Railroad (O&NW, successor to the C&E), which had changed over its line to standard measure, moved its trains from the Little Miami Railroad (Pennsylvania Railroad framework) back to the CL&N. A while later, a third rail was laid north to East Norwood, enabling the O&NW to associate with the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railroad (successor to the M&C). Subsequent to undertaking more enhancements to the arrangement, the organization finished the change of the fundamental line to Lebanon to standard check on September 16, 1894, in spite of the fact that, until it procured a full arrangement of standard measure hardware, a great part of the suburbanite administration to Blue Ash kept on utilizing the restricted check tracks. 

All through the CL&N's freedom, different bigger organizations were hoping to secure it, for the most part for the important Court Street terminal property. The most determined talk was that the Cincinnati, Jackson and Mackinaw Railroad (CJ&M, later a NYC line) would purchase the CL&N as a passage to Cincinnati. The CJ&M had manufactured south from Michigan to Carlisle, Ohio in 1887, and at first procured trackage rights over the CH&D to achieve Cincinnati. Exchanges between the CL&N and CJ&M persuaded the CH&D that the last was fit for turning into a solid contender, in spite of its poor money related state, and the CH&D endeavored to secure the CJ&M in 1892. Be that as it may, the CL&N halted the solidification dependent on Ohio's laws precluding such enemy of aggressive practices, and the CJ&M kept on taking a gander at the CL&N as a conceivable piece of its line. After the CL&N's transformation to standard check was finished in 1894, the CJ&M verified trackage rights over the CL&N into Court Street, starting administration on January 27, 1896 by means of an expansion from Carlisle to Franklin, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Big Four, later a NYC line) to Middletown, and the as of late opened Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad to the CL&N at Hageman. The CJ&M likewise gained the long-torpid Deer Creek Tunnel venture trying to build its very own course into the city, tired of managing Hafer and the CL&N. The Pennsylvania Railroad, proprietor of the Little Miami Railroad that had been built east of Lebanon during the 1840s, entered the exchanges in 1896 to secure its Cincinnati-zone interests, and in March it (through the Pennsylvania Company) procured a greater part of the CL&N's stock. Pennsylvania authorities took over administration in May, and in 1902 the CL&N obtained the passage property and some terminal property close Court Street from the Cincinnati Northern Railroad, successor to the CJ&M, which had moved toward becoming piece of the Big Four and ended its utilization of the CL&N in 1901. 

As a piece of the Pennsylvania framework, the CL&N kept on working its own property (which incorporated the line north of Dodds after 1914) until January 1, 1921, when it was rented to the Pennsylvania. Beginning toward the finish of 1918, the Interstate Commerce Commission ordered the CL&N as a Class I railroad, implying that it made in any event $1 million every year in working income. (This assignment was dropped in 1921 when the CL&N was rented.) However, net working salary, income less costs, which had relentlessly move from the 1890s, started falling in 1916, turning into a shortage in 1920. In this way, compelling January 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania combined the CL&N with a few other little organizationsâthe Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway, Manufacturers Railway, Pennsylvania-Detroit Railroad, and Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroadâto make the Pennsylvania, Ohio and Detroit Railroad, a non-working auxiliary. That organization was converged into the Connecting Railway, already a short connection in Philadelphia, in 1956, and its renter converged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 to frame Penn Central Transportation. 

The line north of Dodds, worked by the TD&B to associate the Cincinnati Northern to the D&SE at Lebanon Junction, was sold independently at the June 1884 dispossession deal, to its first-contract bondholders for $20,000. At first worked under rent by the CL&N, administration was ended in April 1887 when the ex-D&SE was changed over from thin measure to . With its northern association gone, and no on-line wellsprings of income, there was no benefit in working the line. Notwithstanding, one such source would before long be made, when neighborhood agent Henry Lewis chose to buy adjacent "Dayton limestone" quarries at Centerville. He purchased the relinquished rail line from the bondholders' trustees for $40,000 in December 1888, and in January 1889 sorted out the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad (DL&C). Augmentations on the two closures were arranged, north into downtown Dayton and south to a standard measure association. Lewis wrapped up the thin measure line to standard check in January 1891, and at first rented it to the Dayton, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway, successor to the D&SE. He rented in 1890 and later purchased land in Dayton for the proposed terminal, and in mid 1892 he gained the quarries at Centerville, giving the line its wellspring of traffic. The DL&C purchased the line from Lewis in March 1892 for $189,000 in stock, and in June it procured a rent on the CL&N's line among Dodds and Lebanon. In the wake of changing over the track to standard check, the DL&C started tasks into Lebanon in late December 1892. Nonetheless, it was unfit to arrange trackage rights with the Cincinnati, Dayton and Ironton Railroad (the most recent name for the ex-D&SE), and just worked north to Lebanon Junction, where travelers could exchange to that organization's trains into Dayton. For an amazing duration, the DL&C contended with the CL&N wherever conceivable; for instance, the CL&N promoted (alongside the Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad and Big Four) a quicker course among Lebanon and Dayton by means of Hageman and Middletown. 

Lewis passed on in 1893, and in the following decade the DL&C assembled no new lines. Nonetheless, a gathering of financial specialists purchased the organization, including the Dayton terminal property, in 1901 for $250,000 from Lewis' beneficiaries. The primary section of the line into downtown Dayton was finished in late 1902, diverging the fundamental line at Hempstead and completion at Lambeth, site of the Dayton State Hospital. Unfit to get an establishment from Dayton, and still unrewarding, the DL&C entered receivership in January 1905, and was sold at abandonment in April 1907 and revamped in May as the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad and Terminal Company. The bondholders who had composed the new organization prevailing with regards to getting the establishment, and sold the stock to another gathering of financial specialists in January 1909. Development was restarted in April, and in November the branch achieved the crossing point of Brown and Caldwell Streets and the National Cash Register plant. At last, in the wake of finishing the cuts and fills required along the east bank of the Great Miami River, the DL&C opened its new principle line in 1912, to a traveler stop on the north side of Washington Street, a few squares south and west of the city's fundamental Union Station. A cargo warehouse was found just toward the north, at Eaker Street, and just past was an exchange track (not part of the first line) associating with the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (B&O framework) and, through that line, the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Panhandle Route, some portion of the Pennsylvania framework). 

The other line in the long run procured by the CL&N was the Middletown and Cincinnati Railway (M&C, not to be mistaken for the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad talked about before). Paul J. Sorg, proprietor of a tobacco plant east of Middletown, was discontent with the administration given by the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad (at that point free) and Cincinnati and Springfield Railway (Big Four framework), the two of which skirted the focal point of town. Sorg and partners joined the M&C in mid 1890, and overviewed a line from Middletown, which lay in the Great Miami River valley, southeast to a point that would be known as Middletown Junction on the Little Miami Railroad (Pennsylvania framework). Development on most of the course, which crossed the CL&N at Hageman, was finished by September 1891, and a bracket connect over the Little Miami River opened in mid 1892, connecting the line to the Pennsylvania. Access into focal Middletown was deferred until December, when it was at long last ready to cross the CH&D to its stop. Instead of the CL&N and DL&C, the M&C was straight and level, giving a smooth ride, and turned a sensible benefit. The income was insufficient, be that as it may, to satisfy the bonds, and the M&C entered receivership in July 1894. The holders of liens against the property purchased the line at abandonment in October for $335,000, consolidated the Middletown and Cincinnati "Railroad" in December, and chose Sorg president. 

Sorg kicked the bucket on May 28, 1902, and after six days the CL&N, claimed by the Pennsylvania since 1896, purchased its property for $400,000 and started working it as a branch. The DL&C would be procured twelve years after the fact, after the Great Dayton Flood of 1913. The CL&N and DL&C, based on the good countries between the stream valleys, consolidated to give the main access into Dayton amid the catastrophe. The Pennsylvania understood that the DL&C would make a decent obtaining in case of future flooding, and had the CL&N purchase and start working the DL&C for about $700,000 in December 1914. (Through administration among Cincinnati and Dayton had started that late spring.) The DL&C fabricated a short association from Lebanon Junction to the Panhandle Route at Clement in mid 1915, and on July 1 its property turned into that of the CL&N. 

Rivalry from interurbans, explicitly the Cincinnati-Lebanon Interurban Railway and Terminal Company, removed travelers from the earliest starting point in 1903. Be that as it may, the interurban started to decay, leaving business in 1922, and it was engine vehicles that would slaughter the CL&N's traveler administration. The primary line to go was the Middletown Branch, stopped in 1917; the short branch to Montgomery moved toward becoming cargo just in 1926. All administration north of Lebanon finished in 1928, and in 1931 just a single blended train between Court Street and Lebanon was left on the calendar. The less-advantageous Cincinnati Union Terminal supplanted Court Street in 1933, as settled upon by all railways taking an interest in its development. CL&N trains achieved the station by means of trackage rights on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (ex-M&C) south of East Norwood. This was never prominent among CL&N riders, and the keep going planned traveler train on the previous CL&N kept running on January 31, 1934. With traveler administration gone, and a few cross-associations with other Pennsylvania lines, the CL&N was never again required as a through course. Quite a while after the Montgomery Branch was completely deserted in 1933, the Pennsylvania suspended cargo administration between Blue Ash and Mason and among Lebanon and Lytle; trains kept on achieving Lebanon by means of the Little Miami Railroad and Middletown Branch. Administration was continued on the whole line amid World War II, yet the Lebanon-Lytle portion was destroyed in 1952. After the Pennsylvania converged into Penn Central in 1968, a piece north from Brecon was again relinquished, just like the short bit of the Middletown Branch east of the fundamental line at Hageman, with Lebanon administration currently originating from the ex-New York Central at Middletown. The line through the Deer Creek Valley into Court Street was additionally deserted, and the old cargo station was torn down in 1975. 

At the point when the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) obtained the benefits of the bankrupt Penn Central in 1976, it was permitted to pick which lines to keep and which to relinquish. The line among Avondale Brecon still observed overwhelming cargo traffic, and there would even now be a sensible measure of traffic to Mason and Hempstead. In this manner Conrail purchased about portion of the ex-CL&N, including the primary line from Cincinnati to Brecon (Blue Ash Secondary Track), Mason to Hageman (Mason Secondary Track), Hempstead to Pasadena (Kettering Running Track), and Patterson Road to Dayton (DP&L Industrial Track), just as Middletown to Hageman (Middletown Secondary) and Hempstead to (Clement Running Track). Responsibility for residual linesâBrecon to Mason, Hageman to Lebanon, Lytle to Hempstead, Pasadena to Patterson Road, and Hageman to Middletown Junctionâstayed with the Penn Central trustees, in spite of the fact that, with neighborhood financing, Conrail worked the two portions from Hageman to Lebanon and Centerville to Hempstead as "light thickness lines". Tracks among Lytle and Centerville were destroyed in 1979. From that point forward, a few additional portions have been relinquished, including Avondale to McCullough and Centerville to Kettering. Short line Indiana and Ohio Railway (IORY) obtained a large portion of the rest of the 1980s, starting activities from Monroe (close Middletown) to Mason and Lebanon in March 1985, and McCullough to Brecon in December 1986. The city of Lebanon has purchased the Hageman-Lebanon portion, at first claimed by the Penn Central trustees, and the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority gained the property among McCullough and Brecon in 1997 for a proposed open travel line. (IORY keeps on working cargo on both of these portions.) The IORY started running traveler prepares on the Lebanon section in 1985. The traveler activities were part in 1996, experiencing a few renamings to Turtle Creek Valley Railway, Turtle Creek and Lebanon Railway, lastly Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad. Three short portions of line at Middletown and Dayton stayed with Conrail until its 1999 separation, when the Norfolk Southern Railway gained Conrail's advantages in southwestern Ohio. 

Lying on the good countries between the Little and Great Miami Rivers, the CL&N was regularly known as the "Good country Route". While it ordinarily gotten just neighborhood traffic, its area was a particular preferred standpoint amid floods. This was first exhibited amid the Flood of 1884, when the rising Ohio River remove every single other railroad from downtown Cincinnati. Be that as it may, the heap was a lot for the thin check TC&StL, and a few organizations changed to Miami and Erie Canal vessels to make the associations until the waters died down. Comparable Cincinnati floods occurred in 1883, 1897, 1898, 1907, and 1937, yet in 1913 the Great Dayton Flood immersed that city, at that point lying at the north end of the autonomous DL&C. That organization had quite recently finished its line into downtown Dayton, when, not exactly a year later, the Loramie Reservoir got through its levees and sent a swell of water through down the Great Miami River and into the city. Similarly as with the Cincinnati floods, just the CL&N and DL&C were unaffected, and alleviation supplies were sent north from Cincinnati by means of Lebanon to the National Cash Register plant. 

The line started on the east side of downtown Cincinnati, at the edge of Eggleston Avenue and Court Street. The site of the block cargo station, shut in 1969 and wrecked in 1975, is presently possessed by Greyhound Lines, which utilizes it as an intercity transport terminal. A track worked in 1887 crossed Court Street, associating with the Little Miami Railroad's Eggleston Avenue Connection for cargo exchange. The line started by climbing the Deer Creek Valley, the main plausible rail access to downtown Cincinnati that did not pursue a stream valley. At the point when the railroad was worked in the late 1870s, the valley was utilized by the city as a dump. A 1852 city statute accommodated raising the ground level, start with the raising of Court Street by as much as . To pursue the possible surface dimension and keep away from the lofty slopes, the railroad was based on trestles for quite a bit of its climb, with a most extreme level of 3.5%. In the wake of leaving the terminal, the line navigated a S-formed trestle toward the east side of the valley, before intersection Elsinore Place and Eden Park Drive at level, with a second trestle between these boulevards. (The previous was supplanted in January 1889 with a straighter single-track trestle.) An extension took the line over Florence Avenue, and it at that point went through the area of Mount Auburn before going under the summit through the cut-and-spread Oak Street Tunnel north of McMillan Street. The line began its continuous plunge as it left the passage, for the most part following the current ground level and intersection roads at level. 

Twofold tracks at first extended from Court Street to close Fredonia Avenue, where the Avondale Branch split for the Cincinnati Zoo. At the point when the line was changed over to in 1894, the passage and McMillan Street underpass were not sufficiently wide for a twofold track line, yet two standard check tracks were laid one next to the other. After a mishap in 1916, the tracks were relaid as a gauntlet track. The trestles were modified as single-track in 1888 and 1889, after which twofold track just stretched out from Eden Park Drive to Avondale. Because of expanded traveler traffic, the line was re-extended south to Court Street as well as north to Norwood from 1902 to 1904, when the valley had been filled in. Past Avondale, the CL&N dropped through Idlewild, where two Norfolk and Western Railway lines wanderedâthe Cincinnati and Eastern Railway east to Portsmouth and the Cincinnati Connecting Belt Railroad northwest to an intersection close Elmwood Place. The railroad started to climb again at East Norwood, where it crossed the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad (Baltimore and Ohio Railroad), achieving the level good countries at Deer Park. In the late 1880s, the CL&N, with its successive suburbanite administration, added to the advancement of rural areas along its line including Idlewild, East Norwood, Silverton, Deer Park, and Hazelwood. At Hopkins Avenue in Norwood, workers unsatisfied with the uncovered stage worked by the railroad organization raised $1500 to construct a station building, which opened on August 1, 1888, and was possessed by the Hopkins Avenue Depot Company until administration finished during the 1930s. It was later utilized as a corner store, and now houses a chiropractor. As a component of its bicentennial festival, the city of Silverton fabricated a copy of its previous CL&N station with an exhibition hall inside. 

Just past East Norwood, the Pennsylvania assembled McCullough Yard in 1927, improving exchanging activities for the becoming mechanical base in Norwood. An association was incorporated to the Pennsylvania's Chicago-bound Richmond Branch, which the CL&N traversed north of the yard. In Butler County, north of Brecon, the CL&N bended suddenly upper east onto the first line, halfway evaluated during the 1850s among Sharonville and Lebanon. Just past, it started to slip gradually through Mason to Hageman, where it crossed the Middletown Branch, and after that rose somewhat, nearby Turtle Creek, to Lebanon. The Pennsylvania tore down the first Lebanon traveler station in 1960, supplanting it (for cargo purposes) with a littler structure from Kings Mills on the Little Miami Railroad. The Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs procured the land in 1972, tore down the cargo terminal, and raised a reproduction of the old traveler stop in its place, with a blessing shop inside. 

Leaving Lebanon, the line climbed a little gorge and afterward traveled north-northeasterly over the good countries to Dodds. The never-utilized evaluation from Dodds to Waynesville dropped into the Little Miami River valley by means of Newman Run before turning north and completion at the last town. Bits of the option to proceed and stone projections for a few never-manufactured extensions stay on what is currently farmland. The line as finished turned north at Dodds, and required a few slices and fills to navigate the moving landscape. At Hempstead, only north of Hempstead Road, the line split. The first course proceeded with north, parallel to Woodman Drive, to the old Dayton and South Eastern Railroad (presently the Iron Horse Trail) at Lebanon Junction. A 1915 augmentation was manufactured parallel to the ex-D&SE, and finished at the Panhandle Route (presently the Creekside Trail toward the east) at Clement. Some portion of this line is still worked by the Norfolk Southern Railway, and toward the south the option to proceed is being utilized for an expansion of the Iron Horse Trail. The other branch traveled northwesterly into downtown Dayton, relentlessly plunging as it passed south of the University of Dayton and close by the Great Miami River. The principle traveler and cargo warehouses were at Washington Street, which the CL&N disregarded on the main such level detachment in Dayton.
