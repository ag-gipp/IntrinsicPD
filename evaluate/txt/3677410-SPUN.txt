The achievement of the 2004 group and the endeavors amid the off-season energized expectation by games journalists that Texas would play for the national title on the off chance that they could win their away diversion against Ohio State University and end their five-amusement losing streak against Oklahoma. The BCS framework required any group contending in the title amusement to be positioned either numberÂ one or numberÂ two in the BCS Standings toward the finish of the period. 

The last program of the period: 

Texas had not very many issues influencing the program. Just a single guarded starter missed an amusement because of damage. On offense, beginning running back Selvin Young harmed his lower leg in the amusement against Louisiana-Lafayette and re-harmed it the next week against Ohio State. He didn't play in the diversions against Rice or Baylor. Collector Jordan Shipley missed the whole season because of a pulled hamstring.

What's more, they may well inquire as to why climb the most elevated mountain. Why, 35 years back, fly the Atlantic? For what reason rices play Texas?Â ... We go to the moonÂ ... furthermore, do different things, not on the grounds that they are simple, but since they are hard." notwithstanding proceeding with a customary contention, playing Rice in a home and away arrangement takes into consideration Texas to play recreations in Houston, Texas, an essential enlisting base for UT, which has a noteworthy Texas Exes graduated class populace. 

The Horns claimed the ball to begin the amusement and utilized under two minutes in scoring on a 25-yard convey by Jamaal Charles.

Rice lost yardage on their ownership and neglected to change over on fourth down so they turned the ball over on downs. The remainder of the primary half scoring was overwhelmed by the Longhorns as they scored four additional touchdowns to take a 42â 0 lead. The Owls had fourâ more belongings in the secondâ quarter yet never propelled the ball past their own 30-yard line.

The diversion often has suggestions for the meeting and national title races. Since 1945, no less than one of the groups was positioned among the top 25Â teams in the country coming into 60 out of 65Â games. Before the 2005Â game, Texas held leeway in the record-breaking arrangement 55â 39â 5, which incorporated a 43â 35â 4 edge in Dallas, yet Oklahoma had won the 5Â previous recreations, including the two most noticeably bad misfortunes ever for a Texas group in the arrangement.

Texas held the top spot in the PC rankings, however not by enough to remain in front of USC in the general BCS standings. 

Oklahoma State scored first, with an amazing 49Â yard go from Al Pena to D'Juan Woods. The Cowboys had arranged tight on fourth and 1 as though attempting a short, control run, however faked that play and tossed a profound go rather, finding the Longhorn resistance napping. Texas answered with a touchdown go from Young to Thomas, yet David Pino missed the additional point, enabling the Cowboys to hold the lead. Oklahoma State scored another touchdown and Texas finished a field objective to make the score 21â 9 toward the finish of the firstÂ quarter.

The Longhorns initially played the Baylor Bears in 1901 and have confronted them yearly since both were individuals from the Southwest Conference. In the 95Â meetings through 2005, Texas' record was 69Â wins, 22Â losses, and 4Â ties. Just Texas A&M and the University of Oklahoma had confronted Texas all the more frequently on the football field. 

Texas was ceased on their first drive because of an ineffective fourth down transformation. Baylor's first belonging finished when UT's Michael Huff captured a go from Baylor's Terrance Park. Longhorn Jamaal Charles scored a touchdown on the drive yet the kick was blocked, giving Texas the main first-quarter score and a 6â 0 lead. Texas expanded the lead in the secondÂ quarter with surging touchdowns from Henry Melton, Jamaal Charles, and Ramonce Taylor.

The 2005Â Baylor diversion was played in Waco, Texas, roughly 100Â miles (161Â km) north on Interstate 35 from Austin.

UT fans were discontent with ABC's TV inclusion of the occasion. The system chose to stay with the Oklahoma versus Texas A&M amusement as opposed to changing to the Kansas versus Texas diversion. ABC remained with the Oklahoma versus A&M diversion through the last down and afterward ran threeÂ full minutes of advertisements while the Texas versus Kansas diversion proceeded. When they exchanged over Texas was at that point driving 14â 0. The ABC hosts began their inclusion saying "And now, we'll join the amusement you've been sitting tight for all week, which has basically as of now been chosen." ABC at that point split far from their inclusion at halftime to communicate different occasions. This left a huge number of UT fans who collected to watch the diversion in Darrell K. Regal â Texas Memorial Stadium stranded without inclusion for a significant part of the amusement. 

The unbalanced triumph enabled Texas to play a few less-experienced players. Back-up quarterback Matt Nordgren entered the diversion in the thirdÂ quarter, supplanting Vince Young. Third-string quarterback Matt McCoy supplanted Nordgren simply past the midpoint of the fourthÂ quarter. Since Colt McCoy was recorded third on the UT profundity outline, TV telecasters alluded to Matt McCoy (no connection) as Colt McCoy, a slip-up they rehashed over the season. The Longhorns did not play Colt in the 2005Â season, deciding to redshirt him. In the wake of review this amusement as a feature of a selecting visit to UT, Jevan Snead â positioned as one of the top secondary school quarterbacks in the country, chose to change his responsibility from University of Florida to Texas. 

This diversion denoted the 112thÂ meeting among Texas and the Texas A&M Aggies and the amusement is a piece of a multi-sport competition called the Lone Star Showdown. It is the longest-running contention for both the Longhorns and the Aggies and the football arrangement is the third most-played competitions in school football. Texas came into the 2005Â contest with a 72â 34â 5Â record. Amid the week prior to the amusement, the Longhorns led their conventional Hex Rally. Because of a shocking mishap in 1999, the Aggies did not have a school-supported adaptation of their customary Bonfire however an informal variant called "Understudy Bonfire" was held November 19, 2005 in spite of an area wide restriction on blazes. The amusement's participation was 86,616, which is 4,016Â more than the official arena limit with regards to Kyle Field. 

Like the challenge against Missouri, sportswriters touted the Texas A&M diversion as displaying two of the best double danger quarterbacks playing in school football. In any case, Texas A&M's beginning quarterback Reggie McNeal missed the diversion because of a lower leg damage; rather, green bean quarterback Stephen McGee made his first begin. The amusement was a forward and backward undertaking at last won by Texas, 40â 29. The elevenÂ point success was their second slimmest edge of triumph of the customary season to that point, and they lost focuses in every single threeÂ major survey yet at the same time remained emphatically in secondÂ place. 

The diversion was the least fortunate execution of the period by the Longhorns, both upsettingly and protectively. On offense, Vince Young had just 162Â yards of offense, his least yield of the period. The Associated Press commented on the poor execution and said that Young, considered one of the countries best quarterbacks and a Heisman trophy applicant coming into the diversion, was "not in any case the best quarterback on the field that day". "The Daily Texan" anticipated that the amusement could hurt Young's odds for the Heisman, yet they likewise cited UT head mentor Mack Brown as saying "Taking a gander at the numbers from what Reggie Bush did a week ago and Vince did today, Reggie most likely leads, yet one week from now, Vince plays around early afternoon, and Reggie at 3, so I figure voters will pause and watch to perceive what occurs." 

UT running backs Henry Melton and Ramonce Taylor likewise gotten analysis. Taylor was condemned for running in reverse and sideways with an end goal to pick up yards, rather than pushing forward and breaking handles. "The Daily Texan" watched "Five of Taylor's 15Â carries brought about a misfortune or no increase for a sum of short 17Â yards. Be that as it may, the different 10Â carries totaled 119Â yards for a normal of 11.9Â yards per positive running play. The sophomore didn't have a positive addition of less than 5Â yards and gathered three keeps running of 20Â yards or more." Greg Davis, UT's hostile organizer, said "Ramonce is a darter. The main time that truly concerned me was a third-and-two circumstance. We conversed with him on the sideline about somewhat increasingly down and separate mindfulness." Melton was reprimanded for "tiptoeing ambivalently". what's more, giving himself a chance to get handled close to the line of scrimmage. 

On guard, the Longhorns held A&M to just 118Â yards leaving yet gave behind 277Â yards surging; the most noteworthy permitted by the Longhorns all season. In spite of the poor trip, Texas completed the standard season undefeated. Quality Chizik, UT's guarded facilitator, said "This truly is an enlightening knowledge. Clearly, we must show signs of improvement. Yet, I'll disclose to you what, we're all going to commute home 11â 0."

The title diversion pits the Big 12 North Division champion against the South Division champion in an amusement held after the standard season has been finished. In spite of losing the last two rounds of the normal season, Colorado held the best record in the North Division of the Big 12 Conference. Before the amusement, Colorado head mentor Gary Barnett stated, "I don't think anyone anticipates that us should come in here and beat Texas." His group lost the diversion 70â 3, the most disproportionate score in any school football meeting title to date. 

The Longhorns scored tenÂ touchdowns in their first elevenÂ possessions. They began with first-quarter touchdowns by Henry Melton and Jamaal Charles. The Buffaloes got their solitary score of the diversion, a field objective, toward the beginning of the secondÂ quarter. Vince Young, Limas Sweed, David Thomas, and Jamaal Charles scored touchdowns in the secondÂ quarter to give the Horns a 42â 3 lead at halftime. In the second from last quarter, Selvin Young, Charles and Melton each scored surging touchdowns. Brandon Foster scored a touchdown on protection because of Michael Griffin obstructing a Colorado punt. Part of the way through the second from last quarter, Texas previously had 70, however went on journey control starting there on and did not score once more. 

Following the triumph, the to a great extent UT swarm remained in the stands to praise the Longhorns' arrival to the Rose Bowlâthis time for a shot at a National Championship. As players surrounded the arena giving high-fives and handshakes to fans, a segment of the railing crumbled and fans spilled onto the sideline. OneÂ person experienced wounds and was evacuated the field on a stretcher. 

Texas earned its secondÂ Big 12Â football title to make 27Â conference titles all out, including 25Â in the Southwest Conference. The week after the amusement, Barnett was terminated as Colorado's head mentor and supplanted by Dan Hawkins, the previous head mentor of Boise State. 

For the 2005Â season, the Rose Bowl additionally filled in as the BCS National Championship Game because of the Bowl Championship Series understanding. In the weeks paving the way to the 2006 Rose Bowl, the amusement was depicted by various distributions as a standout amongst the most-foreseen coordinate ups in school football history and even as the best school football match-up ever. This was Texas' secondÂ trip to the Rose Bowl in school history, close by their excursion the past season. 

Under threeÂ weeks before the amusement, USC Trojan Reggie Bush won the Heisman trophyâsince emptiedâin front of secondÂ place finisher Vince Young. Bramble had the secondÂ highest number of firstÂ place cast a ballot in Heisman history (behind O.J. Simpson) and the most elevated level of firstÂ place cast a ballot, while Young had a record number of secondÂ place cast a ballot. Hedge's 933-point edge of triumph was the 17thÂ highest in the historical backdrop of the Heisman casting a ballot. The thirdÂ finalist was USC's Matt Leinart, who won the Heisman trophy in 2004. This Rose Bowl would check the first run through twoÂ Heisman trophy victors could ever play in a similar backfield. 

The amusement's result was in uncertainty until the last moment of play. With 19Â seconds left on the diversion clock, Vince Young kept running for a touchdown and recovered the lead for the Longhorns. He followed up by running the ball into the end zone for a two-point transformation. Leinart had sufficient energy to endeavor one pass yet his pass dropped too far out as time lapsed; UT beat USC by the score of 41â 38. 

Youthful finished 30Â of 40Â passes for 267Â yards and conveyed the ball 19Â times for 200Â yards and 3Â rushing touchdowns.

David Thomas' tenÂ receptions set an UT record for most gatherings in an amusement by a tight end. 

Before the amusement, analysts had hypothesized that the 2005 USC group was one of or even "the" "best group ever". ESPN examiners were for all intents and purposes consistent in their presentation of the 2005 USC Trojans as the best offense in the historical backdrop of school football, regardless of the way that they were in second spot behind Texas as far as focuses scored amid the season. ESPN investigators Mark May and Kirk Herbstreit announced, before the 2005 Rose Bowl had even been played, that the 2005 USC Trojans were the secondÂ best school football crew of the past 50Â years. May set them behind just the 1995 Nebraska Cornhuskers; Herbstreit behind just the 2001 Miami Hurricanes. This prompted Texas fans at the Rose Bowl mockingly reciting "BestÂ ... TeamÂ ... Regularly" amid the post-diversion festivity. Stewart Mandell of "Sports Illustrated" watched, "ESPN spent the better piece of Christmas season contrasting that Trojans squad with probably the most acclaimed groups ever just to discover that they weren't even the best group that season." 

Texas' Rose Bowl win was the 800thÂ victory in school history and it earned the Longhorns their fourthÂ consensus national title in football. Since the amusement, the media, mentors, and different analysts have loaded acclaim upon the Texas group, Young, and the Rose Bowl execution. Both the Rose Bowl win just as the Longhorns' general season have both been refered to as remaining among the best exhibitions in school football history by spectators, for example, "School Football News", the "Atlanta Journal-Constitution", "Scout.com", "Austin American-Statesman", and "Sports Illustrated". ESPN granted the two groups the 2006Â ESPY Award for the "Best Game" in any game. 

Texas' success over USC was their ninthÂ consecutive triumph when confronting a positioned rival. Texas broke USC's series of wins (at that point the longest in the country) at 34 and guaranteed the longest running series of wins for themselves at 20Â wins in succession. Texas' 20-amusement series of wins was the second-longest series of wins in school history; Texas had 30 wins in succession from 1968 to 1970. Texas stretched out the series of wins to 21 preceding a September 9, 2006, misfortune to Ohio State University. In beating USC, Texas crushed a No. 1Â ranked group out of the blue since overcoming Alabama in the Orange Bowl on January 1, 1965. The Longhorns finished the season positioned third in the record-breaking rundown of both absolute successes and winning rate (.7143). 

The pre-season releases of the Associated Press Poll and "USA Today" Coaches Poll pre-season surveys both positioned Texas numberÂ two in the country behind shielding National Champion University of Southern California. The two groups kept up those rankings all through the whole 2005Â regular season. Texas was positioned second in every seven day stretch of the BCS rankings, aside from multi week where Texas took the top spot with USC tumbling to numberÂ two. The BCS rankings amid 2005 depended on an equation which considered in the votes of two human surveys (the USA Today mentor's survey and the Harris Interactive survey), joined with an assortment of PC rankings. The PC rankings favored Texas as the No. 1 group all through the whole season, due halfway to Texas' successes over positioned projects, for example, Ohio State University and Texas Tech University. 

On October 24, 2005, Texas passed USC in the BCS rankings because of a solid appearing in the PC rankings, which supported the Longhorns on account of the general quality of their rivals just as the October 22, 2005, prevail upon beforehand unbeaten Texas Tech. The primary spot positioning was the first for UT in the BCS time, and the principal top positioning in any significant football survey since October 8, 1984, when they were on both the Associated Press and Coaches surveys. The 0.0007% edge isolating Texas from USC was the slimmest edge between the best two groups since the beginning of BCS rankings. 

The stay at the top was fleeting. With the October 31, 2005, BCS rankings, Texas stayed first in the PC rankings, with Virginia Tech pulling even with USC for numberÂ two in the PC rankings. Notwithstanding, USC stayed on both human surveys and had the capacity to recover the top by and large positioning. Texas and USC won the remainder of their recreations and confronted each other in the National Championship, which Texas wonÂ 41â 38. This was just the 35thÂ meeting of the twoÂ top-positioned groups in the historical backdrop of school football, including both ordinary season and bowl diversions. The BCS framework presently guarantees that the twoÂ top groups in the BCS rankings face each other every year in a national title diversion, however the strategy for positioning the groups stays disputable among fans and sportswriters. 

The 2005Â season stamps just the eighthÂ time in 50Â years that precisely twoÂ teams have gone into the bowl season undefeated. This has been a noteworthy analysis of the BCS design, which does not utilize a playoff to decide the national title. Except if there are actually two unbeaten groups, both from BCS gatherings, the decision of the top twoÂ teams can create discussion. On the off chance that more than twoÂ undefeated groups stay, at that point at least one of those groups must be forgotten. On the off chance that one or less undefeated groups stay, at that point an adversary must be browsed among the one-misfortune groups, implying that other one-misfortune groups will be forgotten. 

In the eightÂ National Championship recreations through the 2006Â Rose Bowl, the group positioned numberÂ one preceding the amusement has won fiveÂ times, while the numberÂ twoÂ team has won threeÂ times. Up to the 2007 season, no school had won the BCS title twice. In the last surveys after the bowl amusements, Texas got all 62Â first spot cast a ballot in the Coaches Poll and all 65Â first spot cast a ballot in the AP Poll.

Shrubbery was once in the past a Governor of Texas and his little girl Jenna is an UT graduate. On February 14, 2006, Bush hosted the group and mentors at the White House. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger lost a wager with Texas Governor Rick Perry on the result and needed to send Perry a bin of "California wines, products of the soil treats".

Starting at 2007 sportswriters keep on discussing whether Vince Young and the other capable UT players prevailing in spite of Davis or as a result of him.
