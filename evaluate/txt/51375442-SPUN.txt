Post Vancouver Centennial half dollar 

The Fort Vancouver Centennial half dollar, once in a while called the Fort Vancouver half dollar, is a memorial fifty-penny piece struck by the United States Bureau of the Mint in 1925. The coin was structured by Laura Gardin Fraser. Its front-side portrays John McLoughlin, who was responsible for Fort Vancouver (present-day Vancouver, Washington) from its development in 1825 until 1846. From that point, he successfully led the Oregon Country, in the interest of the Hudson's Bay Company. The switch demonstrates a furnished frontiersman remaining before the post. 

Washington Representative Albert Johnson needed a coin for Fort Vancouver's centennial festivals, however was convinced to acknowledge a decoration. Be that as it may, when another congressman was effective in altering a coinage bill to include a dedicatory, Johnson attached language approving a coin for Fort Vancouver. The Senate consented to the changes, and President Calvin Coolidge marked the approving follow up on February 24, 1925. 

Fraser was locked in to structure the coin on the proposal of the United States Commission of Fine Arts. The coins were flown from the San Francisco Mint, where they were struck, to Washington state via plane as an exposure stunt. They sold seriously; a significant part of the issue was returned for reclamation and dissolving, and the disappointment may have been a factor in one authority's suicide. Because of the low number of enduring pieces, the coins are profitable today. 

Stronghold Vancouver, on the north bank of the Columbia River in what is today Vancouver, Washington, lay over the stream from what might move toward becoming Portland, Oregon. It was established in 1825 by the Hudson's Bay Company boss factor for the zone, Dr. John McLoughlin. The organization looked for hides and other exchange merchandise, and was in rivalry with John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Company, which had a station at what is currently Astoria, Oregon. Fortress Vancouver was named for the British ocean commander George Vancouver, who likewise gave his name to Vancouver in Canada. 

Until the Oregon Treaty of 1846 settled the questioned cases of the United States and Britain, McLoughlin was what government there was in the Oregon Country. McLoughlin's oath was obeyed by white man and Native American alike, and there were no huge wars there in that time. Fortification Vancouver turned into the exchanging place for a substantial region, and the biggest settlement west of the Great Plains. With the happening to American principle in 1846, McLoughlin left the Hudson's Bay Company, going to Iive at Oregon City, which he had established, and turned into its city hall leader in 1851, two years subsequent to turning into a U.S. native. He kicked the bucket in 1857; after a century, the Oregon Legislature named him the "Organizer of Oregon", and Fort Vancouver is currently a national noteworthy site. 

The Fort Vancouver Centennial Corporation would have liked to sell dedicatory half dollars at the arranged festival, and induced Representative Albert Johnson of Washington state to present enactment in the House of Representatives. In May 1924, he and Senator Wesley Jones, likewise of Washington state, presented enactment in their places of Congress for a half dollar recognizing the centennial of Fort Vancouver. The bills were not given any hearings. Indiana Representative Albert Vestal, the executive of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, met with Johnson and induced him to present a bill for an award. Vestal contemplated that the Treasury Department was restricting progressively memorial coin issues, as these were finding their way into flow and confounding the general population. On February 3, 1925, Jones presented a bill for an award, and on the twelfth, Johnson did likewise. 

Enactment for a Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollar had been presented by that state's senior representative, Frank Greene, and had passed the Senate. 

At the point when that charge went to the floor of the House of Representatives on February 16, California Representative John E. Raker moved to correct it to accommodate a California Diamond Jubilee half dollar. Vestal requested to be heard contrary to the alteration, expressing that his panel, subsequent to prescribing the Vermont bill, had chosen to advance no further coin bills. He included that along these lines, Johnson had consented to pull back his bill. The Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Finis J. Garrett of Tennessee, inquired as to why the board of trustees had not set the standard before considering the Vermont bill, and Vestal let it be known was difficult to reply. The House casted a ballot, and the correction was included. Johnson to acclaim from his partners moved a further alteration, to include "and Vancouver, Wash." The revision go, as did the bill. 

Johnson understood that such a straightforward alteration probably won't result in a coin being issued. He along these lines came back to the House floor before long, asking that the bill be reexamined, so he could lounge chair his revision in a similar expressing with respect to the next two coins. When the bill was again being considered, Johnson included his change, yet Vestal moved that the bill be come back to his council. Vestal's movement fizzled, 24 ayes to 67 noes. Protracted procedural wrangling pursued about whether that vote could be protested on the grounds that there was no majority present. When that was settled, the House passed the bill once more. The bill was come back to the Senate the next day. Kansas' Charles Curtis proceeded onward benefit of Greene that the Senate consent to the House alterations, and however Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon asked President Calvin Coolidge to veto it, the bill, approving every one of the three coins, was instituted by the President's mark on February 24, 1925. 

When the coin had been affirmed by Congress, the Centennial Corporation submitted mortar models by an obscure craftsman, whose initials showed up on the front. They were sent to the Commission of Fine Arts, charged by a 1921 official request by President Warren G. Harding with rendering warning conclusions in regards to open fine arts, including coins. The models demonstrated McLoughlin on the front and the stronghold stockade with Mount Hood out of sight for the switch. These plans were likely managed by the Centennial Corporation. On May 22, the Commission dismissed the models, depicting them as "fascinating" yet expressing that an accomplished medalist would be required. It suggested Chester Beach, however when the company attempted to enlist him, it worked out that he was voyaging. The organization rather procured the commission's second decision, Laura Gardin Fraser, an accomplished planner of dedicatory coins. 

Since the Centennial Corporation had chosen what structure components it needed to see on the half dollar, Fraser needed to do her very own translation of the plans SB had attempted. Employed on June 15, she finished her models by July 1, when Louis Ayres, an individual from the commission, came to see them. He was eager, and sent a letter to commission administrator Charles Moore with that impact, stating "the entire coin looks intriguing to me, and I believe is strong great." The models were endorsed by the commission, and after that by Mellon. Kicks the bucket were set up at the Philadelphia Mint, at that point sent to San Francisco, where the coins were to be struck. 

The front-side highlights a picture of McLoughlin, confronting left. The name of his received nation overarches him, and his name and are underneath him, with the centennial dates and flanking his bust. Fraser had no resemblances of McLoughlin to work with, and what she put together her representation of him with respect to is misty. It indicates him as a more seasoned man than the 41 years he was at the season of Fort Vancouver's establishing. The invert demonstrates an outfitted frontiersman, wearing buckskins, with the stockade of Fort Vancouver behind him, and Mt. Hood out yonder. The engraving is fairly separated, however is expected to be perused as . Numismatists have discussed whether the nonattendance of a mint imprint was purposeful; it is the main dedicatory coin issue struck at Denver or San Francisco that needs one. The craftsman's initials, , are at lower directly on the switch, on the opposite side of the hover from the date . 

Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their 1988 book on dedicatory coins, depict Fraser's structure as "superior to anything [Chester] Beach could have thought of". Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on the masterfulness of U.S. coins and decorations, esteemed Fraser's half dollar "a most satisfactory coin". He expressed, "the front attempts Pisanello's dividing of the lettering and delineated harshness of the bust, while the invert has an excessive amount of landscape out of sight, encompassed by an excess of lettering. This and the Hawaiian Sesquicentennial coin of 1928 demonstrate that foundation view or topography should be precluded from memorial half dollars". 

Just 50,000 of the approved mintage of 300,000 were instituted, in addition to 28 pieces proposed to be sent to Philadelphia to be accessible for assessment and testing at the 1926 gathering of the yearly Assay Commission. The stamping was done not later than August 1 at San Francisco. As an exposure stunt, the whole mintage (less the 28 test coins) was flown via air to Vancouver, Washington, by United States Army Air Corps Lieutenant Oakley G. Kelly on August 1; the shipment, including bundling, weighed . On landing, the coins were gotten by Herbert Campbell, leader of the centennial commission. 

The half dollars were expected to help pay for the centennial merriments in Vancouver. These were held from August 17 to 23, with a feature being a show, "The Coming of the White Man", which "depended on recorded reality". The coins were sold at $1 each; few hundred were plated, lessening their future incentive as numismatic examples; others were kept as pocket pieces, or were spent. 

The poor deals caused budgetary issues and may have caused a suicide, for on August 22, Charles A. Watts, secretary of the Centennial Corporation and depicted by Campbell as the genuine power behind the coin, slaughtered himself. The day preceding he passed on, he told a gathering of the enterprise that there were subsidizes enough to pay all obligations, and that Fraser was not owed any cash. Neither turned out to be the situation, and unpaid bills totaled $6,000, with no cash to pay them. Actually, Fraser's charge of $1,200 was remarkable, and she endeavored to get paid even with the half dollars, yet her bill was unsatisfied until a year later, when she was paid with a money order. The half dollars were not claimed by the company, as the Vancouver National Bank had propelled cash for them. Deals went to a virtual end before the finish of October. Texas coin seller B. Max Mehl offered to purchase the rest of the issue without needing any proof, yet this was rejected the same number of individuals had paid $1 for their coins. An aggregate of 35,034 pieces were sent back to the mint for reclamation and softening, leaving 14,966 pieces extraordinary. As indicated by Swiatek and Breen, "given the remoteness and solely neighborhood nature of the festival, it is astonishing that upwards of fourteen thousand coins were sold." 

A closeout of 1,000 coins was made to an official of the Hudson's Bay Company, and they were put in the Archives of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. They were stolen in 1982 by an overseer, who spent them and reclaimed some for Canadian cash at a bank. Many injury up in the hands of a coin vendor, who sold them broadly. At the time, the coins were worth about US$800 each. When the burglary was understood, the Province of Manitoba recorded suit to recuperate the rest of the coins, yet a settlement enabled the vendor to hold them. 

The coins immediately instructed a premium after their 1925 issue because of their shortage, ascending to $10 by 1928 preceding falling back to $7 by 1930, in uncirculated condition. They crested at about $9 amid the dedicatory coin blast of 1936. They had died down back to the $6 level by 1940, yet from that point expanded consistently in esteem, ascending to $1,600 amid the second memorial coin blast in 1980. The release of R. S. Yeoman's "A Guide Book of United States Coins" distributed in 2017 records the coin for somewhere in the range of $300 and $975, contingent upon condition. A close perfect example sold at closeout in 2014 for $8,225.
