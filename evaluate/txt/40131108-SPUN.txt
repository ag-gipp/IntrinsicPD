It tends to numerous types of bondage, including the military utilization of youngsters in Uganda, automatic subjugation in the United States, unfree work in Ghana, constrained asking and refuse picking in India, sex dealing in Europe and Southeast Asia, and different sorts of tyke misuse. The focal point of the film is on dealing exploited people, particularly ladies and youngsters, the last of whom are frequently double-crossed by grown-ups that they trust. The film likewise centers around the general population and associations occupied with neutralizing human dealing, including individuals from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Free the Slaves, Girls Educational and Mentoring Services (GEMS), International Justice Mission (IJM), the Somaly Mam Foundation, Terre des hommes, Tostan, UNICEF, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the United States Department of State (US DoS).

As indicated by Nancy Keefe Rhodes of "Stone Canoe", a U.S. artistic diary, the film's crowds are probably going to have the predisposition that human dealing isn't subjection in a similar sense that the Atlantic slave exchange was, and numerous individuals trust that subjugation was abrogated quite a while back with so much instruments as the U.S. Liberation Proclamation and Thirteenth Amendment. Rhodes composes that society presently utilizes "subjugation" in current settings just as an analogy, with the goal that references to genuine contemporary servitude can be rejected as metaphor, and she portrays the film's objective as to "recover the first term [slavery] and persuade us that what's going on now is the thing that happened at that point: very sorted out and unavoidable, deliberate, exceptionally productive andÂ ... completely as coercive and wantonly unfeeling." Rhodes says that "bondage" has begun to be utilized in its unique sense again as of late, yet that groups of onlookers' perspectives on contemporary subjugation are in any case affected by the slave-like symbolism in such movies as "Hustle and Flow" (2005) and "Dark Snake Moan" (2007). The Academy Award-winning "Hustle and Flow" depicts a pimp as the saint, while "Dark Snake Moan" highlights Christina Ricci as a youthful nymphomaniac; the showcasing for "Dark Snake Moan" focused on suggestive, sexualized slave symbolism, including a sparsely clad Ricci in chains.

Another American casualty of sexual dealing, Sheila White, portrays an occurrence in 2003 when she was whipped by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. She says that no one even inquired as to whether she required help. White inevitably got away from being dealt and proceeded to work with GEMS to bring issues to light on the issue in New York.

"In all likelihood Sokny too was sold," Chhun says, guaranteeing that "the police treated it like she wasn't essential"â maybe, she recommends, on the grounds that Sokny was a received kid. Wear Brewster of Agape International Missions is met, and says that the majority of the young ladies they have safeguarded from kid sex the travel industry in Cambodia recognize Americans as the customers who were the most damaging to them.

In Guatemala City, Guatemalan dealer Efrain Ortiz is demonstrated being captured, and the film shows that he was later given a jail sentence of 95 years.

Minister Desmond Tutu, who Bilheimer had recently met for "The Cry of Reason", shows up towards the finish of the film, saying, "Every one of us has the ability to be a holy person."

The last scene of "Not My Life" comes back to the kid holding his breath submerged in Ghana. His name is uncovered to be Etse, and it is expressed that he and six other dealing unfortunate casualties appeared in the film have been safeguarded. A portion of the final words in the film are spoken by Brazilian human rights advocate Leo Sakomoto: "I can't see a decent life while there are individuals living like creatures. Not on the grounds that I'm a decent individual, not on the grounds that it's my obligation, but since they are humanâlike me." 

The venture that progressed toward becoming "Not My Life" was started by the official executive of the UNODC, Antonio Maria Costa, who needed to commission a film that would "convey the issue of present day subjection to the consideration of popular feeling, comprehensivelyâparticularly the benevolent, reputable and God-dreading individuals who don't think something so shocking is occurring in their own neighborhood." With this objective at the top of the priority list, Costa moved toward Worldwide Documentaries, an East Bloomfield, New York-based association that had created two movies with which he was well-known: "The Cry of Reason", which records inward protection from South African politically-sanctioned racial segregation by method for Beyers NaudÃ©'s story; and "A Closer Walk", which is about the study of disease transmission of HIV/AIDS. Costa messaged Bilheimer, Director of Worldwide Documentaries, requesting that he make the movie he imagined. Costa said that he pick Bilheimer in light of the fact that the executive had built up a "strong notoriety [for] tending to troublesome subjects... consolidating creative ability, a philosophical view about improvement and a compassionate feeling about what to do about the issues." 

Bilheimer acknowledged Costa's recommendation, and accordingly composed, created, and coordinated "Not My Life" as an autonomous film. Bilheimer, who had gotten an Academy Award selection for "The Cry of Reason", said that "the persistent, unpunished, and timid abuse of a huge number of people for work, sex, and several sub-classes thereof is just the most shocking and harming articulation of supposed human development we have ever observed." Bilheimer's better half, Heidi Ostertag, is Worldwide Documentaries' Senior Producer, and she co-created "Not My Life" with him. She said that she discovered making a film about human dealing troublesome in light of the fact that "individuals would prefer not to discuss this issue." Bilheimer found that the associations he had made amid the generation of "A Closer Walk" were likewise helpful while creating "Not My Life" on the grounds that poor people and the outsider are at the most serious danger of both HIV/AIDS and human dealing; there is, therefore, much cover between the gatherings defrauded by these two pains. Bilheimer endeavored to form the film so that all aspects of it would outline an announcement made by Abraham Lincoln: "If servitude is right, nothing isn't right." 

When making this film, Bilheimer held that a contemporary abolitionist development did not yet exist. He depicted his motivation in making the film as to bring issues to light and start such a development.

Bilheimer said that the dimension of remorselessness he found in shooting "Not My Life" was more noteworthy than anything he had seen while reporting politically-sanctioned racial segregation in South Africa for "The Cry of Reason". Bilheimer validated ending up increasingly mindful of the worldwide degree of human dealing as he approached making "Not My Life". The film's title originated from a June 2009 meeting with Molly Melching, organizer of Tostan, an association devoted to human rights instruction working in ten African nations. As Bilheimer and Melching talked in ThiÃ¨s, Senegal, examining how individuals frequently prevent the truth from claiming contemporary subjugation since it is an awkward truth, Melching stated, "Individuals can say, 'No, this isn't my life.' But my life can change. How about we change together."

Recording in Svay Pak occurred in March 2010, and shooting in Abusir, Egypt occurred the next month. 

In Guatemala, Bilheimer encouraged the capture of dealer Ortiz by leasing a vehicle for the police to use, so as to film the capture as a component of "Not My Life". Bilheimer said that, amid the creation of the film, he and his team were astonished to find that dealers utilize comparable strategies for terrorizing over the globe, "as though there wereÂ ... unwritten standing rules and tacticsÂ ... The untruths are the equivalent."

A much shorter variant, just 30 minutes in length, was made considering school gatherings of people. 

Content identifying with the Egyptian blended sex schools organized by Suzanne Mubarak was accumulated, however Bilheimer inevitably expelled quite a bit of this substance from the film on the grounds that the Arab Spring made the data in this part of the film obsolete, in spite of the proceeded with presence of the vast majority of these schools. A great part of the meeting with Molly Melching was evacuated also. Amid the altering of "Not My Life", Bilheimer cut the meeting with Tutu, however later re-included a solitary citation. In this meeting, Bilheimer informed Tutu regarding meeting ordinarily sensible, sympathetic ladies who, when talking about human dealers, state things like "Hang him up by his balls and afterward cut them off!" Tutu, leader of reality and compromise commission, shocked Bilheimer with his reaction, saying that "these individuals have submitted immense acts," yet that, as indicated by Christianity, dealers can at present be reclaimed and become holy people.

On November 1, a 83-minute rendition of the film was discharged on DVD by Worldwide Documentaries, which likewise started carefully conveying the film and selling the boundless licenses. LexisNexis, the legislatures of Arizona and Minnesota, and the U.S. Store for UNICEF all bought licenses. The last association intended to utilize the film as a component of an enemy of human-dealing effort.

Fragments from the film were incorporated into "Would you be able to Walk Away?", a 2012 presentation on contemporary servitude at President Lincoln's Cottage at the Soldiers' Home in Washington, DC. An inn network introduced the film to its staff in London in anticipation of the 2012 Summer Olympics to bring issues to light about the kinds of human dealing that may happen related to the occasions. Bilheimer started an Indiegogo crowdfunding effort in 2012 to permit nearby associations contradicting human dealing to screen the film. That equivalent year, he communicated an eagerness to discharge fifteen-minute portions from the film to enable its message to contact more individuals. 

In a 2012 meeting, Bilheimer said that he considered "A Closer Walk" and "Not My Life" to be the initial two portions in a set of three; he proposed to make an ecological film called "Take Me Home" as the third portion.
