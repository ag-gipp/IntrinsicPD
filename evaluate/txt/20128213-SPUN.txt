Collins has said that the motivation for "The Hunger Games" originated from station surfing on TV. On one channel she watched individuals contending on an unscripted TV drama and on another she saw film of the attack of Iraq. The two "started to obscure in this very agitating way" and the thought for the book was shaped. The Greek legend of Theseus filled in as a noteworthy reason for the story, with Collins portraying Katniss as a cutting edge Theseus, and Roman gladiatorial recreations gave the structure. The feeling of misfortune that Collins created through her dad's administration in the Vietnam War was likewise an impact on the story, with Katniss having lost her dad at age 11, five years before the story starts. Collins expressed that the passings of youthful characters and other "dull sections" were the most troublesome pieces of the book to compose, however that she had acknowledged that entries, for example, these were important to the story. She considered the minutes where Katniss thinks about more joyful minutes in her past to be increasingly charming. 

In the country of Panem, built up in the remaining parts of North America after an obscure prophetically catastrophic occasion, the well off Capitol misuses the twelve encompassing regions for their regular assets and work. DistrictÂ 12 is in the coal-rich locale that was once Appalachia, while the Capitol is in the Rocky Mountains. As discipline for a past fizzled defiance to the Capitol, which brought about the demolition of District 13, one kid and one young lady between the ages of 12 and 18 from every one of the 12 remaining areas are chosen by a yearly lottery to take an interest in the Hunger Games, a challenge in which the "tributes" must battle to the passing in an open air field until just a single remains. 

The story is described by 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen from District 12, who volunteers for the 74th Hunger Games instead of her 12-year-old sister, Primrose. The male tribute is Peeta Mellark, a previous classmate of Katniss who once gave her bread from his family's pastry shop when her family was starving. In the days paving the way to the Games in the Capitol, they are given guidance by their inebriated tutor, Haymitch Abernathy, the sole living District 12 victor of the Hunger Games; chaperone Effie Trinket; and different beauticians to upgrade their open recognition to get potential supporters, who will send conceivably life-sparing blessings amid the Games. Katniss' beautician, Cinna, planned uncommon ensembles for Katniss and Peeta that set them apart from the tributes when acquainted with people in general. Amid their assessment by the Gamemakers, Katniss out of the blue gets the most astounding score among the others. In the interim, Rue, the petite 12-year-old young lady tribute from District 11, chases after Katniss and Peeta amid the instructional meetings. On the day preceding the recreations, in the broadcast meet with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta uncovers his since a long time ago pathetic love for Katniss; she is at first stunned by this and trusts this is a ploy to pick up supporters, yet later acknowledges this as earnest. Haymitch then advances their picture as "star-crossed darlings". 

The Games start, and almost a large portion of the tributes are murdered in the bloodbath toward the begin, battling about the weapons and supplies all through the field. Katniss slights Haymitch's prior counsel to escape quickly and about kicks the bucket, yet utilizes her all around working on chasing and ingrained instincts to cover up in the forested areas. Following a couple of days, a fake flame drives Katniss toward the others. She is spotted and treed by the "Vocations" tributes and Peeta, who appears to have aligned with them. Lament, covering up in an adjacent tree, quietly alarms Katniss to a "tracker jacker" home, which she sends it falling down, discharging the flying creepy crawlies. Their venom slaughters one of the professions and pushes the others away, however Katniss is stung and starts fantasizing. Peeta returns, yet as opposed to murdering her, advises her to flee. Katniss later structures a partnership with Rue, yet Rue is lethally injured by another tribute while Katniss annihilates the professions' provisions. Katniss murders Rue's executioner with a bolt, and goes with Rue as she kicks the bucket and spreads blooms over the body to demonstrate her insubordination against the Capitol. In appreciation, Rue's locale sends Katniss a portion of bread. 

A standard change is reported, permitting the tributes from a similar locale to win as a couple. Katniss finds and medical attendants an injured Peeta (who later uncovered that he framed a collusion with the professions to secure Katniss), acting the piece of a young lady in adoration to pick up blessings. At the point when the Gamemakers send a conveyance of what every candidate needs most, Katniss dangers her life to get medication for Peeta. She is caught by a lifelong tribute Clove, who boasts over Rue's passing and attempts to murder Katniss, however is slaughtered by Thresh, the male District 11 tribute, who saves Katniss for the wellbeing of Rue. The prescription spares Peeta's life, and they both invest energy chasing and gathering nourishment. 

Katniss and Peeta become the last two survivors, yet the Gamemakers renounce the standard change to compel one to murder the other for an emotional finale. In insubordination, Katniss plans to devour the noxious "nightlock" berries with Peeta. Acknowledging they mean to end it all so that there won't be a victor for the amusements, the Gamemakers pronounce Katniss and Peeta the victors. Albeit them two get a legend's welcome as a couple, Katniss is cautioned by Haymitch that the Capitol may make a move against her for her resistance. En route back to District 12, Peeta is grief stricken to discover that Katniss' activities were a piece of a determined ploy to pick up compassion. Katniss, be that as it may, is uncertain of her own emotions and her future. 

In a meeting with Collins, it was noticed that the novel "handles issues like serious neediness, starvation, mistreatment, and the impacts of war among others." The epic arrangements with the battle for self-conservation that the general population of Panem face in their areas and the Hunger Games in which they should take an interest. The natives' starvation and their requirement for assets, both in and outside of the field, make an environment of vulnerability that the fundamental characters endeavor to defeat in their battle for survival. Katniss needs to chase to give nourishment to her family, bringing about the improvement of abilities that are valuable to her in the Games, (for example, her capability with the bow and bolt), and speaks to her dismissal of the Capitol's tenets notwithstanding hazardous circumstances. Regarding the matter of the Games' parallels with pop culture, Darren Franich of "Stimulation Weekly" composes that the book "is a sharp parody of unscripted tv appears", and that the character of Cinna "nearly appears to be a competitor on a fundamentalist rendition of "Undertaking Runway", utilizing Katniss' outfits as a vehicle to express possibly hazardous thoughts." 

The decisions the characters make and the systems they use are frequently ethically intricate. The tributes construct an identity they need the gathering of people to see all through the Games. Library diary "Voice of Youth Advocates" names the significant topics of "The Hunger Games" as "government control, 'older sibling', and individual autonomy." The set of three's subject of intensity and destruction, like that of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar", was brought up by its distributer Scholastic. Laura Miller of "The New Yorker" finds the creator's expressed reason of the Games â an activity in purposeful publicity and an "embarrassing just as painful [...] discipline" for a fizzled uprising against the Capitol numerous years earlierâ to be unconvincing. "You don't cripple and dehumanize a subject people by transforming them into famous people and training them on the most proficient method to make an engaging persona for a mass group of onlookers." But the story works much better if the topic is changes of secondary school and "the immature social experience". Mill operator composes: 

"The guidelines are discretionary, unimaginable, and subject to abrupt change. A fierce social chain of importance wins, with the rich, the gorgeous, and the athletic ruling their preferences over every other person. To endure you must be thoroughly phony. Grown-ups don't appear to see how high the stakes are; as long as you can remember could be finished, and they act like it's simply some "stage"! Everybody's continually watching you, examining your garments or your companions and fixating on whether you're engaging in sexual relations or taking medications or getting sufficient evaluations, yet nobody cares who you truly are or how you truly feel about anything." 

Donald Brake from "The Washington Times" and minister Andy Langford express that the story has Christian topics, for example, that of selflessness, which is found in Katniss' substitution for her more youthful sister, undifferentiated from the penance of Jesus as a substitute for the compensation of sins. Brake, just as another analyst, Amy Simpson, both find that the story additionally spins around the topic of expectation, which is exemplified in the "upright integrity of Katniss' sister, Primrose." Simpson likewise indicates occasions like the Passion of Jesus; in the Games, "Christ figure" Peeta Mellark is wounded subsequent to notice Katniss to escape for her life, and is then covered in the ground and put in a cavern for three days before rising with another rent on life. Further, she finds that the Christian picture of the Bread of Life is utilized all through "The Hunger Games"; in the story, Peeta gives Katniss a portion of bread, sparing the young lady and her family from starvation.
