Four Daleks, joined by a gadget known as the "Beginning Ark", have risen up out of the Void ship inside the Torchwood Institute's circle chamber. The Cybermen who assumed responsibility for Torchwood go up against the Daleks, offering a coalition. The Daleks decrease and murder two Cybermen, making the Cyber Leader announce war on the Daleks. 

A strike group from the parallel universe takes the Doctor to meet with Pete Tyler. In the wake of hearing that the parallel Earth has begun warming at an exceptional rate following the opening of the break between the two Earths, the Doctor guesses this is the beginning of the procedure that will prompt the two planets falling into the Void. 

In the circle chamber, the Doctor understands that the four Daleks are the cryptic Cult of Skaro, and gets the Cybermen to assault. Mickey inadvertently enacts the Ark while getting away with the Doctor, Rose, and Pete. Dalek Sec takes the Ark outside. Pete spares Jackie from the Cybermen and the two grasp.

As he returns to directing the TARDIS, he sees a secretive lady in a wedding dress remaining inside. 

The idea of the Daleks and Cybermen seeming together on screen isn't new; in December 1967, the BBC moved toward Terry Nation to have the two races in a sequential, however Nation vetoed this thought. The idea came to Davies while mapping out the 2006 arrangement: the story would both serve to revive the well known Daleks and give an appropriate exit to Piper, who had chosen to leave "Specialist Who" after two arrangement. "Doomsday" is the principal scene in the historical backdrop of "Specialist Who" where the Cybermen and the Daleks show up on-screen together; Cybermen and Daleks were both included in "The Five Doctors" and "Armed force of Ghosts", however in discrete scenes. 

The two-section finale was initially going to happen in Cardiff on the time crack, which was the focal point of the scenes "The Unquiet Dead" and "Blast Town". Whenever "Torchwood" was appointed in 2005, Davies chose to base the turn off in Cardiff and move "Armed force of Ghosts" and "Doomsday" to Canary Wharf in London. 

A thing of discourse between the generation staff was over who might safeguard Rose; Davies and Julie Gardner needed Pete to protect her, while Clarke and Phil Collinson needed Mickey. The job was at last given to Pete, to underscore that he had acknowledged Rose as a surrogate little girl. The Doctor's planned answer to Rose was likewise examined; Davies, who left the answer unspecified, expressed he didn't have a clue when asked by Collinson on the scene's editorial track, and Gardner intensely trusted the Doctor would respond Rose's affection. 

A few components of the story were roused by Philip Pullman's "His Dark Materials" set of three. Pullman was "complimented" by the references in the scene, and contrasted Davies' activities with his own routine with regards to referencing works. 

To guarantee that Clarke and Dingwall were accessible for shooting, the story was recorded in the season's third generation hinder with "Ascent of the Cybermen" and "The Age of Steel". Shooting for the story began on 2 November 2005 on area in Kennington, London, yet did not turn into the essential focal point of the creation group until 29 November, when taping started on the scenes in and around the circle load. The scene of the Tylers driving through Norway was shot at Bridgend on 6 December. Scenes in the switch room, the primary setting for the story, were taped on 12â 15 December 2005 and 3â 5 January 2006. Greenscreen work for Rose being sucked into the void occurred on 13 January, and the encounter between the military and Cybermen on the scaffold was shot on 15 January. 

Other area shooting occurred at the Coal Exchange and Mount Stuart Square, Cardiff Bay. The penultimate scene of the scene, the Doctor's goodbye to Rose, was recorded on 16 January 2006; it was the latest day of taping for Clarke and Dingwall. Likewise with all scenes set at Bad Wolf Bay, these were in certainty taped at Southerndown shoreline in the Vale of Glamorgan. Flute player's last scene was Rose's gathering with the Doctor in "The Satan Pit" on 31 March, yet the shoot was fairly passionate, to the point there were a few tears on set. The last scene of "Doomsday", Catherine Tate's appearance in the TARDIS as Donna Noble (credited as "The Bride"), was recorded on 31 March amid the wrap party. To guarantee the mystery of Rose's takeoff and Tate's appearance, just Piper and Tennant were given contents of the flight scene, and chief Graeme Harper was not educated of the last scene until the latest moment possible. 

Just as utilizing existing music, for example, the subjects for the Daleks, Cybermen, and Rose, Murray Gold exceptionally made a piece out of music for Rose's goodbye entitled "Doomsday", which included vocal work from Melanie Pappenheim. Rather than utilizing the swelling violins that Davies and the remainder of the generation group had expected, Gold adopted a moderate strategy. When pitching the track to the generation group, Gold portrayed the track as speaking to Rose's unbridled vitality and assurance as she scans for the Doctor. He later stated, "I needed to get that sort of throbbing, kind of hurt sound of very enthusiastic shake, since I suspected that is the thing that Rose would do on the off chance that she was harming and kept running up to her room and secured herself her room and had a decent old cry, extremely." The piece utilizes a similar vocal work from "Rose", when Rose first enters the TARDIS, along these lines making a bookend impact. It is a most loved among fans and of official maker Julie Gardner, and is one reason, alongside Pappenheim's general commitment and the "Melody for Ten" from "The Christmas Invasion", that the was discharged a while later. 

To ensure however much data concerning the scene as could be expected, the last scene of "Armed force of Ghosts" was retained from all pre-screeners given to analysts. The BBC site's Fear Forecasters, a board who rate the scenes, were not permitted to see "Doomsday" before its airing, and access to duplicates was limited; the site accordingly does not have a Fear Forecast for the scene. Regardless of this, the Dalek Sec prop, which had been beforehand unused in the arrangement, had attacked the phase at the 2006 BAFTA Television Awards while the creation group were gathering an honor. A comparable ban would be put on coming up next arrangement's finale, "Last of the Time Lords".

"TV Without Pity" gave the scene an A+ rating. "The Stage" remarked that the Dalek-Cybermen strife was the "main thing worth viewing" at the end of the week, eclipsing even the World Cup Final, and that the separating scene was "wonderfully composed and movingly played," with "not a dry eye known to man". Dek Hogan of "Computerized Spy" felt that the scene was "wonderfully offset and with snapshots of high fervor and contacting strength" and that the single oil tear shed by the Cyberman rendition of Hartman was a "pleasant touch". He reprimanded Catherine Tate's appearance as being pointless to end the scene and for "breaking the inclination".
