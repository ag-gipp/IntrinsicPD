The diversion's deals surpassed desires; by August 1999, more than one million duplicates had sold around the world. It produced two spin-offs created and discharged for the GameCubeâ"" and ""â just as "", a profound successor discharged for Windows and Nintendo 64. 

Dissimilar to the that stresses space battle reenactment, "Rebel Squadron" is a quick paced, arcade-style activity amusement. Every one of the diversion's sixteen dimensions presents mission targets that must be finished to advance to the following dimension. These goals are separated into four classes: seek and devastate, observation, salvage, and ensure. Foe flying machine are basically made out of TIE contenders. Ground protections are increasingly fluctuated and incorporate three distinct walkers, laser and rocket turrets, tanks, test droids, transports, stormtroopers and speeder bicycles. 

The heads-up presentation includes a wellbeing meter, a radar and an ammo mean auxiliary weapons. The player can control five specialty: X-wing, A-wing, Y-wing, snowspeeder and V-wing. Every vehicle offers a one of a kind deadly implement game plan, just as shifting degrees of speed and mobility. The amusement at first confines the player to a specific art for each dimension; in any case, after a dimension is finished, it very well may be replayed with any accessible art. Levels set on non-environmental moons uncover the player's specialty to space; subsequently forbidding the Speeder and V-Wing (which are repulsorcraft) from being utilized; yet as on different dimensions, the art is vertically limited. Nine reward catalysts are covered up in various dimensions all through the amusement. These rewards improve an art's weapons or toughness and are connected to each qualified specialty for the rest of the diversion. 

The player's execution is estimated all through the amusement, and execution measurements are checked after each dimension against three award benchmarks. Every benchmark contains five classes: finish time, number of foes decimated, shot precision, number of inviting specialty and structures spared and number of rewards gathered. On the off chance that a player's exhibition surpasses one of the dimension's three benchmarks in each of the five classifications, a decorationâbronze, silver or goldâis granted on fulfillment. Procuring these decorations advances the player's position and opens concealed substance. 

"Maverick Squadron" incorporates various unlockable privileged insights. The player can open three extra dimensions: "Bum's Canyon", "The Death Star Trench Run" and "The Battle of Hoth". These dimensions are made accessible when the player acquires all bronze, silver or gold decorations, separately, on each dimension. Then again, they can be opened through password. In contrast to the amusement's essential dimensions, the extra dimensions are adaptions of occasions from the "Star Wars" films. "Bum's Canyon" enables the player to reenact the race referenced in "", while "The Death Star Trench Run" enables the player to execute a substitute variant of the motion picture's climactic fight. In the "Clash of Hoth" reward level, the player can join the Rebel Alliance's battle against Imperial troops, as portrayed in "The Empire Strikes Back". 

A few specialty are likewise accessible when opened. Both the "Thousand years Falcon" and a TIE interceptor are at first present in the specialty choice screen. Be that as it may, neither might be chosen until the player enters the right passwords or accomplishes all bronze or silver decorations, separately, on the extra dimensions. Two other art can be opened, yet each is bound to a particular dimension. One is the T-16 Skyhopper in "Poor person's Canyon", and an AT-ST is playable in a fundamental show level opened just by means of password. A playable model of a 1969 Buick Electra 225 dependent on a vehicle possessed by the amusement's sound originator, Rudolph Stember, is additionally incorporated into the diversion as an Easter egg. 

Amid "Rebel Squadron" advancement, ""â the main new "Star Wars" film in more than 15Â yearsâwas short of what one year from its planned discharge date. To exploit this advertising opportunity, Factor 5 included substance from the up and coming film in "Rebel Squadron". LucasFilm furnished the engineers with structure craftsmanship for the Naboo Starfighter, a ship conspicuously included in the new film. These structures were utilized to make an in-amusement demonstrate. Since the amusement was booked to be discharged a half year before the film, Factor 5 was required to keep the ship's consideration a mystery. Therefore, the greater part of the amusement's improvement group at Factor 5 and LucasArts were not educated of its consideration. A complex scrambling framework was likewise created to help conceal the ship's code from gamers utilizing cheat cartridges, for example, GameShark or Action Replay. Over a half year after the arrival of "Rebel Squadron", LucasArts uncovered the code to open the Naboo Starfighter as a playable specialty. The code has been named the Nintendo 64's most well-shrouded code as a result of the time allotment before its revelation. 

"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron" is set in the anecdotal "Star Wars" world, where a war is battled between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. The diversion's initial fifteen dimensions happen a half year after the Battle of Yavinâas delineated in "A New Hope"â and before the occasions of "The Empire Strikes Back". As the Empire accumulates quality for a hard and fast strike on the revolutionary powers, Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles structure Rogue Squadron, a gathering involving twelve of the most talented X-wing pilots from the Rebel Alliance. 

The sixteenth and last dimension of the amusement happens amid "Dim Empire", six years after ""'s Battle of Endor. The Rebel Alliance has built up the New Republic, which presently controls seventy five percent of the world. After the passings of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, the Galactic Empire crumbled, yet was renewed under a puzzling new pioneer (who is really a clone of Palpatine). Rebel Squadron, presently under the direction of Wedge Antilles, keeps on battling the Empire to secure the recently framed Republic. 

The story is partitioned into four sections, every one of which begins with an opening slither looking like those highlighted in the "Star Wars" films. Further story subtleties are introduced through the amusement's guidance manual, pre-mission briefings, character discussions amid the diversion and in-amusement cut scenes. The diversion starts with Rogue Squadron quickly experiencing the Empire at the Mos Eisley spaceport on Tatooine. The group at that point executes escort and salvage missions on Barkhesh and Chorax, separately. 

The Rebels discover that Imperial officer Crix Madine wishes to abandon to the Rebel Alliance. The Empire dispatches an assault on Corellia, where Madine is positioned, to keep his takeoff. Maverick Squadron, with the assistance of Han Solo and Chewbacca in the "Thousand years Falcon", wards off the Empire and helps escort Madine securely off the planet. Before long, Rogue Squadron is joined by Gold Squadron, a gathering of Y-wings currently driven by Crix Madine; they are dispatched to the moon of GerrardÂ V to help its mission for freedom from the Empire. They experience the 128th TIE interceptor Squadron and incapacitate Kasan Moor's TIE. At the point when Rogue Squadron discloses to Moor that she has been taken prisoner, she offers to abscond and give the Rebel Alliance Imperial insight. 

With the assistance of Kasan Moor's knowledge, the Alliance dispatches three back to back assaults on Imperial bases all through the cosmic system. After a strike on the Imperial Enclave, an office on KileÂ II supporting the Empire's Naval tasks, Wedge Antilles is trapped by a gathering of TIEs and is abducted. The Rebel Alliance tracks Wedge to an Imperial jail complex on the planet of Kessel. The rest of the individuals from Rogue Squadron travel to Kessel and salvage him and other Rebel detainees. 

With Wedge Antilles free and Rogue Squadron again at full quality, the Rebel Alliance directs its concentration toward another Imperial danger â Moff Kohl Seerdon. Seerdon is combining Imperial power in anticipation of an assault went for catching Thyferra, a planet which delivers the recuperating substance bacta. Rebel Squadron is requested to upset his activity with attempt at manslaughter missions against key focuses on Taloraan and Fest. In striking back, Seerdon assaults and holds a city on the planet of Chandrila prisoner. Rebel Squadron and the Alliance strike back by starting a Kasan Moor-designed attack on an Imperial base situated inside a well of lava on Sullust. While still on Sullust, nonetheless, General Rieekan illuminates the Squadron that Moff Seerdon has utilized their strike as a redirection and started his assault on Thyferra. With Seerdon responsible for the planet's bacta and their very own supply undermined, Rogue Squadron rapidly comes to Thyferra, slaughters Seerdon and liberates the planet. 

In the last part, the amusement moves into the future, six years after the Battle of Endor. Maverick Squadron, presently under the order of Wedge Antilles, keeps on battling the injured Empire. On the planet of Mon Calamari, new Imperial weapons called World Devastators are obliterating the planet. Rebel Squadron is conveyed, cripples every one of the three Devastators and demolishes the Imperial nearness. 

After the accomplishment of "" on the Nintendo 64 out of 1996, LucasArts started arranging a development. At the time, Factor 5 was building up an amusement motor to make extensive territory maps. LucasArts, satisfied with prior joint efforts with the organization, chose to utilize Factor 5's motor for its new amusement. The amusement's center would be space battle; this heading was roused by a dimension of "Shadows of the Empire" in which the player flies a snowspeeder amid the Battle of Hoth. "Maverick Squadron" and Factor 5 creation director Brett Tosti expressed, "That entire scene was really the beginning for Rogue Squadron since everyone stated, 'For what reason don't you complete an entire amusement like that?' So we factored." 5 at first pitched an idea to enable gamers to play through missions like the fans' most loved activity arrangements from the "Star Wars" films. This proposition was rejected, be that as it may. Around then, LucasFilm was not happy with computer games drawing legitimately from the movies. 

Amid the beginning periods of improvement, the planners at LucasArts were enlivened by "Rebel Squadron" and later "", a progression of books and comic books set amid the long stretches of the first film set of three. They started building up the story and ongoing interaction with a comparable setting that would incorporate characters from the movies taking an interest in new, unique missions utilizing Factor 5's landscape guide motor as the base. In May 1998, a demo of the diversion was shown at E3, yet the amusement was so fragmented at the time that Tosti thought of it as a tech demo. It rendered an essential heightmap and a stable AT-AT model, while TIE warriors lacking man-made reasoning flew and terminated in a foreordained way. When "playing" the demo for gatherings of people, Tosti pursued a quite certain flight way of his own to give the dream that he was really engaging with the TIEs. In spite of the demo's barebones introduction, reaction from gamers was to a great extent positive. 

Factor 5 spoke to Nintendo to utilize the Nintendo 64's recently created memory Expansion Pak. Nintendo was hesitant, anticipating that the innovation should be held exclusively for equipment peripherals. In any case, after Iguana Entertainment utilized the Expansion Pak to accomplish a higher showcase goals for "", Factor 5 was given the green light. The Expansion Pak is utilized to expand "Maverick Squadron's" N64 goals from 320Â ÃÂ 240 to 640Â ÃÂ 480. 

LucasFilm was reluctant to concede access to the "Star Wars" library of audio cues for the amusement's sound planner, Rudolph Stember. As a trade off, the organization furnished Stember with sounds examined at the moderately low rate of 22Â kHz, a large portion of the standard rate. Stember questioned, asserting that the clasps sounded more regrettable than impacts he had lifted from VHS tapes for a past "Star Wars" venture. The diversion incorporates voice work from a few prominent people, including screen on-screen characters Olivia Hussey and Raphael Sbarge just as voice performers Bob Bergen, Neil Ross and Terence McGovern. Rather than utilizing Nintendo's default sound drivers, Factor 5 built up its own device called MOsys FX Surround. The Factor 5 drivers use Nintendo 64 processors, yet charge them less; propelled pressure systems were additionally utilized. Subsequently, the amusement incorporates over 80Â minutes of amazing stereo sound. 

In November 1998, a month prior to the diversion's planned discharge, LucasArts consented to an overall arrangement with Nintendo concerning three new "Star Wars" computer games. It conceded Nintendo the rights to showcase the amusements and hold selective, overall conveyance rights for a long time following each discharge. "Maverick Squadron" was the principal amusement discharged under this understanding. 

To advance the arrival of the diversion, Mark Hamill, the on-screen character who played Luke Skywalker, visited the Mattel Children's Hospital in Los Angeles to play the amusement with patients utilizing recently included Starlight Fun Centers. 

Numerous surveys looked at "Star Wars: Rogue Squadron" to one of its motivations, the Battle of Hoth flight battle level in "Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire", thought about one of that diversion's best components. "GamePro" commented that "Maverick Squadron" "upgraded the flight display with genuine pitch, roll, and bank mechanics". IGN commended its consideration of "redesigns, more foes, better stable, and staggering second-age illustrations". The Nintendo 64 rendition got generally positive audits, and got a total score of 85 percent from both GameRankings and Metacritic. "GamePro" named it a standout amongst the best diversions discharged in 1998. In a 2008 review, IGN's Levi Buchanan expressed that the amusement restored the "Star Wars" permit on consoles through all around paced ongoing interaction, a story integrated with the "Star Wars" group and visuals that made it "one of the age's top shockers". 

The diversion's specialized viewpoints were singled out for recognition. Its visuals were designated "decent" in the standard goals, however exceedingly commended in high-goals mode (accomplished by means of the Nintendo 64's Expansion Pak). GameSpot commented that in a higher goals, "[the] surfaces of the scenes, the boats, the lighting impactsâeverything looks so much better," while IGN's Peer Schneider stated, "Subsequent to playing the amusement in the discretionary high goals mode (640Â ÃÂ 480) once, it's difficult to return to the still good standard goals." Citing subtleties, for example, decals, Rebel markings, R2 units, cockpit perspectives and fumes flares, Schneider depicted the diversion's 3D transport models as "beautiful". IGN's Matt Casamassina said that the diversion was the most attractive Nintendo 64 amusement to date. 

Analysts additionally applauded the amusement's sound plan. Fueled by the new Factor 5 sound drivers, "Rebel Squadron" includes about 40Â minutes of discourse and 40Â minutes of music. GameSpot's Ryan Mac Donald trusted that the diversion's consideration of broadened voice work made a "motion picture like" environment. IGN noticed that notwithstanding being actually noteworthy, the diversion's Dolby Pro Logic encompass sound was a critical interactivity component. The sound signs helped players decide foe positions and bearing of movement. IGN granted the amusement three sound honors, including Sound Effects, Best Voice and Best Overall Sound of 1998 on the Nintendo 64. 

A few commentators grumbled about parts of the diversion's visuals; faultfinders loathed the overwhelming dependence on separation mist. Another regular analysis of the amusement was the absence of multiplayer modes. "GamePro" audit considered the exclusion a "genuine, inexcusable sin"; Schneider trusted that while including these modes would have expanded "Maverick Squadron" replay esteem, the diversion was as yet pleasant for its award compensate framework and substantial number of insider facts and unlockables. 

Albeit about indistinguishable, the amusement's PC rendition gathered lower audit scores than its Nintendo 64 partner, with a totaled GameRankings score of 80 percent. This variant appreciated a significant number of similar gestures of recognition for its ongoing interaction, however dealing with and designs were refered to as dangerous. Straightforwardly contrasting the two forms, AllGame's Brad Cook composed that PC rendition's dealing with is more troublesome than the N64 adaptation. He trusted the PC's "uneven" feel made it hard to target foes. As opposed to its assessment of the N64 form, IGN's PC survey was not eager about the diversion's visuals. IGN staff commented that "Maverick Squadron"s "designs and embellishments aren't stupendous" and that they had "seen better illustrations" on the PC. 

At the point when "Maverick Squadron" was discharged toward the beginning of December 1998, the title's Nintendo 64 manifestation was the second-most elevated selling computer game for the principal half of the month (behind Nintendo's "") and the Christmas season.
