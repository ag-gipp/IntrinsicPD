FBI specialists Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called to the scene; Mulder trusts that the man's passing was brought about by a lethal portion of pheromones. There is likewise equivocalness in comparative killings with regards to the sex of the executioner. Proof from the wrongdoing scene drives the team to an Amish-like network in Steveston, Massachusetts, which Mulder calls the Kindred. 

Mulder approaches a portion of the Kindred, just to be evaded. In the mean time, Scully becomes a close acquaintence with a part, Brother Andrew (Brent Hinkley), who is hesitant to talk.

While examining the portion's beginnings, maker Glen Morgan said that he "needed a scene with to a greater extent a hot edge". It demonstrated hard to depict sex as convincingly frightening, which made the makers present the idea of "individuals like the Amish who are from another planet". "Sex Bender" was written by independent essayists Larry and Paul Barber, whose underlying draft concentrated vigorously on the complexity between the cultivating network of the Kindred and a form of city life "with extremely sexual undertones", affected by crafted by Swiss craftsman H. R. Giger. This content experienced different revamps amid the advancement procedure, including the evacuation of a scene where somebody's groin decays away, to address worries about the substance of the scene.

Furthermore, an inside set developed to speak to the tombs under the Kindred's animal dwellingplace was so burdening to film in that a second unit team were required to reshoot a huge level of camera inclusion. This requirement for additional recording required an extra day of shooting for scenes highlighting Duchovny. 

The outside shots of the town occupied by the Kindred were recorded at a ranch safeguarded from the 1890s in Langley, British Columbia, while inside sets were based on a sound stage. The community visited by the specialists was shot on area in Steveston, British Columbiaâan area which was returned to film the primary season scene "Supernatural occurrence Man".
