In spite of the fact that the Islanders intended to have Luongo play in the NHL for the 1998â 99 season, a conflicting execution at preparing camp prompted Luongo's arrival to the QMJHL that season. Due to having neglected to settle on an agreement before October 1, 1998, Luongo was not permitted to be called up to the Islanders from junior through the span of the resulting season. He began the season with Val-d'Or yet was exchanged to the Acadie-Bathurst Titan amid the 1999 World Junior Championships for the rest of the 1998â 99 season.

Luongo shielded himself by saying he didn't redirect from his standard diversion day schedule by taking a gander at only one loft. 

In the off-season, the Islanders chose goaltender Rick DiPietro with the primary by and large pick in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. DiPietro's choice replaced Luongo as the most noteworthy drafted goaltender in NHL history and the Islanders' goaltender of things to come. Thus, Milbury exchanged Luongo to the Florida Panthers alongside focus Olli Jokinen for winger Mark Parrish and focus Oleg Kvasha that equivalent day on June 24, 2000. The arrangement would later be believed to have lopsidedly profited the Panthers, as both Jokinen and Luongo would in the end form into star players, as opposed to Parrish and Kvasha. Luongo communicated shock at the exchange, saying, "I didn't anticipate it by any means. One day they're disclosing to me I'm the goalie of things to come, and the following day I'm no more.

With the NHL set to continue in 2005â 06, Luongo was without an agreement. After exchanges fizzled, the Panthers petitioned for mediation on August 11, 2005. The procedure granted Luongo a one-year, $3.2Â million contract on August 25. 

On April 13, 2006, Luongo turned into the most-wins Panthers goaltender ever, passing Vanbiesbrouck, with his 107th success with the group â a 5â 4 extra time triumph against the Ottawa Senators.

Luongo's entry in Vancouver finished a seven-and-a-half-year time of precariousness for Canucks netminding, with an aggregate of 18 goaltenders having played for the club since Kirk McLean's flight in 1998. General chief Brian Burke had authored the expression "goalie burial ground" amid his residency in Vancouver to portray the club's goaltending fortunes. 

Luongo recorded a 3â 1 success against the Detroit Red Wings in his Canucks debut on October 5, 2006. Later in the month, he scored his first shutout with the Canucks, halting 32 shots in a 5â 0 success over the Chicago Blackhawks on October 25.

Released from the clinic on amusement day, Luongo recorded a shutout that night against the Montreal Canadiens on January 16, 2007. Amid the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas, Luongo was named the Skills Competition's top goaltender and helped the West to a 12â 9 prevail upon the East. Late in the season, Luongo recorded his establishment record-setting 39th win in a 2â 1 extra time triumph on March 9. He outperformed Kirk McLean's 38-win mark set in 1991â 92. He proceeded to complete with a profession high 47 wins, one short of class pioneer Martin Brodeur, who broke Bernie Parent's thirty-three-year-old NHL record of wins in a season. Luongo and Brodeur are considered, notwithstanding, to have been given favorable position to Parent with the introduction of the shootout that season by the NHL, enabling more recreations to be chosen with wins, instead of ties. 

Notwithstanding his 47 wins, Luongo recorded a 2.29 GAA (which was around then, an individual best) and a group record .921 spare rate (outperforming Dan Cloutier's .914 spare rate in 2003â 04; later broken by Cory Schneider's .929 spare rate in 2010â 11).

The 2007 playoffs denoted Luongo's first NHL post-season appearance. Confronting the Dallas Stars in the opening round, he nearly set a NHL record for most spares in a playoff amusement in his post-season debut. He ceased 72 shots, in transit to a 5â 4 fourfold additional time triumph, one spare short of Kelly Hrudey's 73-spare imprint set in 1987.

After the diversion finished in guideline at a 1â 1 tie, he missed the initial three minutes of the main additional time frame to what was first accepted to be a gear glitch. In any case, after the arrangement finished, it was uncovered that Luongo, rather, had a less than ideal instance of looseness of the bowels. The Canucks lost the diversion 2â 1 in the second extra time when Luongo took his eye off the puck to take a gander at the arbitrator, trusting a punishment ought to have been issued to the Ducks on a play in which Canucks forward Jannik Hansen was hit by Ducks forward Rob Niedermayer. With Luongo not focusing, Ducks defenceman Scott Niedermayer shot the puck from the point to score the arrangement winning objective. 

Toward the finish of the period, Luongo was selected for three noteworthy NHL grants: the Vezina Trophy, Lester B. Pearson Award and Hart Memorial Trophy as the class MVP. Be that as it may, Luongo completed second in the voting in favor of every one of the three honors, behind Brodeur for the Vezina and Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins for the Hart and Pearson.

He was casted a ballot in as the 2008 NHL All-Star Game's Western Conference beginning goalie for the second back to back season, despite the fact that he didn't go to so as to be with his pregnant spouse in Florida. 

With the Canucks engaging for the Northwest Division title throughout the entire season, a losing mark that saw Luongo win just a single of his last eight begins made the Canucks miss the playoffs by and large. All things considered, he got his second sequential group MVP and Molson Cup grants. He additionally completed seventh in Vezina Trophy balloting. 

On September 30, 2008, preceding the beginning of the 2008â 09 season, Vancouver Canucks general supervisor Mike Gillis and head mentor Alain Vigneault named Luongo the twelfth commander in group history, supplanting the withdrew Markus NÃ¤slund. The choice was eccentric, as group rules disallow goaltenders from being commanders. In that capacity, Luongo turned out to be just the seventh goaltender in NHL history to be named a chief, and the first since Bill Durnan captained the Montreal Canadiens in 1947â 48 (after which the association actualized the standard). So as to represent the association rule, Luongo did not play out any of the on-ice obligations saved for chiefs and did not wear the skipper's "C" on his pullover. Rather he consolidated it into the work of art on the facade of one of his veils which he once in a while wore for the early months of the 2008â 09 season. Canucks defenceman Willie Mitchell was assigned to deal with correspondences with on-ice authorities, while defenceman Mattias Ãhlund was in charge of stately faceoffs and other such customs related with captaincy. Focus Ryan Kesler was picked alongside Mitchell and Ãhlund as the third interchange chief. 

A month into the 2008â 09 season, Luongo started a shutout mark that kept going three diversions against the Nashville Predators, Phoenix Coyotes, and the Minnesota Wild, much the same as the accomplishment he achieved around the same time of November the earlier year. His general shutout streak was snapped at 242:36 minutes, in a 2â 1 shootout misfortune against the Colorado Avalanche, outperforming the Canucks record he set the past season. Soon thereafter, on November 22, Luongo left an amusement versus the Pittsburgh Penguins subsequent to enduring an adductor strain in his crotch. At first recorded as week-to-week, he endeavored what was viewed as an early rebound inside about fourteen days of the damage, yet endured a difficulty amid a group practice on December 10, leaving right off the bat in distress. Subsequent to missing 24 amusements, Luongo made his arrival on January 15, 2009, in a 4â 1 misfortune to the Phoenix Coyotes. While harmed, Luongo was picked for the fourth time to the NHL All-Star Game in 2009 as the solitary Canucks delegate. In spite of hypothesis he would need to miss his second in a row All-Star Game, Luongo recouped in time and partook in a 12â 11 shootout misfortune toward the Eastern Conference. He completed the season with consecutive shutouts in the last two amusements against the Los Angeles Kings and Colorado Avalanche to build up another profession high of nine shutouts on the season, breaking Dan Cloutier's past establishment single-season shutout record of seven, set in 2001â 02. 

Winning their second Northwest Division title in three years, Luongo and the Canucks came back to the playoffs following a one-year nonappearance. Amid the 2009 playoffs, he drove the Canucks to a first round scope of the St. Louis Blues. The Canucks at that point confronted the Chicago Blackhawks in the second round, which Chicago at last won in six amusements. Luongo was intensely scrutinized following his execution in the 6th and choosing amusement, permitting seven objectives in the 7â 5 misfortune. In a post-amusement talk with, Luongo told journalists that he "let [his] partners down". Numerous in the Vancouver media rushed to propose exchanging Luongo, contending that his expansive compensation could be better spent, while indicating a few effective groups with moderately low-pay goalies. In any case, Luongo was displayed at the year-end grants service with the Scotiabank Fan Fav Award, a fan-casted a ballot grant in its debut year for the group's most loved player. Additionally completing fourth in Vezina Trophy casting a ballot, he passed up his second designation in three years by one vote, behind Niklas BÃ¤ckstrÃ¶m of the Minnesota Wild, Steve Mason of the Columbus Blue Jackets and trophy-victor Tim Thomas of the Boston Bruins. 

With one season left on his unique four-year manage the Canucks, Luongo and operator Gilles Lupien started contract exchanges with general supervisor Mike Gillis in the 2009 off-season. At the season of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, ESPN detailed that Luongo and the Canucks had concurred on a long haul expansion to be reported on July 1. The report was, be that as it may, denied by both Lupien and Gillis. Barely a month later toward the beginning of August, Gillis disclosed to Vancouver sports radio station TEAM 1040 out of a meeting that he was "rationally" near an arrangement with Luongo to be marked before the up and coming 2009â 10 season. That equivalent month, while at Team Canada's mid year camp for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Luongo set a September 13 due date to sign an agreement before the Canucks' preparation camp started, clarifying that he "won't consult amid the season ... [not wanting] that diversion". 

A few days after the fact, on September 2, the Canucks reported that they had marked Luongo to a 12-year contract augmentation worth $64Â million for a $5.33Â million yearly pay top hit. The front-stacked arrangement, which will lapse when Luongo is 43 and incorporates a no-exchange proviso, sees him make $10Â million in 2010â 11, at that point around $6.7Â million every year through to 2017â 18, $3.3Â million and $1.6Â million the ensuing two seasons, before following off to $1Â million for the last two years. The agreement contains two extra conditions to go around the no-exchange proviso that permit Luongo to encourage an exchange after the fifth year and for the Canucks to likewise encourage an exchange after the seventh year. 

About a month into the 2009â 10 season, on October 25, 2009, Luongo recorded his 21st shutout as a Canuck (48th profession) in a 2â 0 success against the Edmonton Oilers, outperforming Kirk McLean as the establishment shutouts pioneer. The accompanying amusement against the Detroit Red Wings on October 27, he endured rib damage that was uncovered the next day to be a hairline crack. Luongo initially harmed his rib two recreations earlier against the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 24 subsequent to making a go in the chest from Leafs' forward Niklas Hagman. The damage was re-disturbed amid the Detroit amusement amid an impact with Red Wings forward Todd Bertuzzi. He came back to the lineup on November 10 subsequent to missing six diversions. On January 7, 2010, Luongo recorded his 50th profession shutout in a 4â 0 success against the Phoenix Coyotes. Regardless of account the second 40-win period of his profession, Luongo completed with his most noticeably awful factual season as a Canuck, vigorously influenced by a poor second-half. Pulled multiple times in 68 appearances, he recorded a 2.57 GAA and a .913 spare rate. In the ensuing 2010 playoffs, the Canucks crushed the Los Angeles Kings in six amusements just to be vanquished by the Chicago Blackhawks for the second year straight. 

In the off-season, it was estimated by numerous individuals in the media whether Luongo would remain Vancouver's skipper, refering to the additional weight of the goaltending position. After the Canucks' 3â 1 arrangement shortage in the second round, Luongo stopped to make himself accessible for pre-amusement interviews â a standard practice for goaltenders, yet not for skippers. At the point when asked after the Canucks' disposal whether he figured he ought to remain group skipper, he told columnists he didn't think it was an issue. Be that as it may, Gillis, who delegated him skipper two seasons earlier, affirmed it was a point to be tended to in the off-season. On September 13, 2010, Luongo affirmed he was venturing down, expressing that "Serv[ing] as captain...in a Canadian city for a group with such energetic fans is a benefit and an encounter I will dependably invest heavily in. I will keep on being a pioneer in this group and bolster my partners a similar way I generally have while concentrating on our definitive objective." Center Henrik Sedin, who won the Hart Trophy for the 2009â 10 season, was named Luongo's successor in a pre-amusement service to the Canucks' season-opener. 

Likewise in the off-season, Gillis terminated Luongo's goaltending mentor Ian Clark and employed Roland Melanson in his place. Luongo had been a close companion of Clark's and freely expressed being amazed and frustrated with the switch. The choice to employ Melanson was to a great extent accelerated on his eagerness to work with Luongo on a full-time premise â something Clark was unfit to do. Regardless of the instructing change at the club level, Luongo held Clark as his own mentor for his mid year preparing. He started working with Melanson paving the way to the 2010â 11 season and utilized a few changes in his playing style, which included playing further into his wrinkle as opposed to testing shooters. 

Amid the 2010 pre-season, Luongo supported crotch damage, yet recouped in time for the customary season. Halfway through the crusade, Luongo was named the NHL's Second Star of the Month for December 2010. He posted a 11â 1â 2 record with a 2.07 GAA, a .922 spare rate and one shutout.

Group the board had attested toward the start of the crusade that new kid on the block reinforcement Cory Schneider would be allowed the chance to play in 20 to 25 diversions. Luongo completed the season with a class driving 38 wins, alongside 22 misfortunes (15 in guideline and 7 in extra time or a shootout).
