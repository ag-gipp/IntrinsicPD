One author called him "the most celebrated non-popular individual in London". As indicated by Lynne Truss, Green turned out to be such a universal figure in and around Oxford Street in the West End that, as Zelig, he was "available in each highly contrasting picture of London swarms that one has ever observed". 

For a long time, from 1968 until 1993, Green watched Oxford Street with a bulletin suggesting "protein insight", a low-protein diet that he said would hose the moxie and make individuals kinder. His 14-page independently published leaflet, "Eight Passion Proteins with Care" experienced 84 releases and sold 87,000 duplicates more than 20 years. 

Green's "crusading for the concealment of want", as one author depicted it, was not constantly well known, yet Londoners built up a friendship for him. The "Sunday Times" talked with him in 1985, and the design house Red or Dead utilized his "less energy from less protein" motto in one of its accumulations. When he passed on matured 78, the "Day by day Telegraph", "Gatekeeper" and "Times" every single distributed tribute, and the Museum of London obtained his flyers and notices.

Subsequent to going to Wood Green far reaching school, Green joined the Royal Navy in 1938. As indicated by Philip Carter in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", Green was stunned while in the Navy by the fixation on sex. "I was dumbfounded when things were said transparentlyâwhat a spouse would state to his better half when home on leave," he told the "Sunday Times" "A Life in the Day" segment in 1985. "I've generally been an ethical kind of individual." 

Subsequent to leaving the Navy in September 1945, Green worked for the Fine Art Society. In March 1946, Carter composes, he fizzled the selection test for the University of London, at that point worked for Selfridges and the common administration, and as a storeman for Ealing Borough Council.

He lived with his folks until they kicked the bucket, his dad in 1966 and his mom the next year, after which he was given a board level in Haydock Green, Northolt, north London. 

Green started his central goal in June 1968, at 53 years old, at first in Harrow on Saturdays, turning into a full-time human board a half year later on Oxford Street. He cycled there from Northolt with a sandwich board appended to his bike, an adventure that could take as long as two hours, until he was given a transport pass when he turned 65.

He was captured for open deterrent twice, in 1980 and 1985. "Its bad form upsets me," he stated, "in light of the fact that I'm making such a decent showing with regards to." He took to wearing overalls to shield himself from spit, which he found a few times on his cap by the day's end. 

Sundays were spent at home creating "Eight Passion Proteins" on his printing press, displayed after his demise at the Serpentine Gallery and portrayed by Waldemar Januszczak as "an unprecedented home-made contraption deserving of Heath Robinson". The "marvelous hints of pounding and slamming" caused inconvenience among Green and his neighbors. Noted for its unpredictable typography, "Eight Passion Proteins" experienced 84 versions, 52 of them somewhere in the range of 1973 and 1993.

It finished by notice: "Be careful with the enjoyment of foul recommendations; of the beguilement from the titillating embarrassment of private lives; of the redirection of the strip of low news-casting etcetera. These things dissolve our ethics and turn youthful personalities." notwithstanding the flyer, Green left a few unpublished original copies, including a novel, "Behind the Veil: More than Just a Tale"; a 67-page content, "Enthusiasm and Protein"; and a 392-page release of "Eight Passion Proteins", which, Carter composes, was dismissed by Oxford University Press in 1971.

In 2013 Martin Gordon incorporated a track about him on his collection "Incorporate Me Out". Diminish Watts wrote in "Londonist" in 2016 that Green was for a period "the most renowned non-well known individual in London, a figure perceived by millions regardless of whether couple of ever really addressed him. Oxford Circus has never felt a remarkable same without him." When Green kicked the bucket, Lynne Truss recommended in "The Times" that he be embedded retroactively into the last passage of Charles Dickens' epic "Little Dorritt":
