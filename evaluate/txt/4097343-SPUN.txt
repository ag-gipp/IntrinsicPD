Ryan kept on oozing trust in the group, composing on ESPN's preparation camp visit transport "Prospective Champs" in August, referencing that the Jets would make it to the Super Bowl and become the possible victors. Ryan had been approached to sign the Jets' logo on the back of the transport however incorporated the message with his mark. The forecast was met with some analysis while others commended his recklessness, something that was felt to need in the NFL at the time. At the point when the group showed up on the TV arrangement "Difficult times" that equivalent month, Ryan was scrutinized, especially by previous head mentor Tony Dungy, for his utilization of foul language. Dungy and Ryan later met face to face to accommodate their disparities. Ryan's title claims were about demonstrated right as the Jets opened the season with the best record in the NFL at 9â 2. This set the phase for a "Monday Night Football" matchup with their division rival, the Patriots, who were additionally 9â 2. The Patriots, behind the solid execution of quarterback Tom Brady, crushed the Jets 45â 3. Notwithstanding, the Jets completed the season with a 11â 5 record and qualified as a trump card group in the playoffs. The Jets were one win shy of tying the establishment record in wins set by the 1998 group driven by Bill Parcells. 

In the Wild Card Round, the 6th seeded Jets beat the AFC South boss and third-seeded Colts 17â 16 on January 8, 2011, at the Colts' home field, Lucas Oil Stadium, to meet all requirements for the Divisional Playoffs.

The Jets opened their 2011 battle with a 2â 3 record, prompting discontent inside their clubhouse. The group had started to stray from its rationality of reliably running the ball and started to pass all the more regularly, however the offense battled with this alteration. Wide recipients Plaxico Burress, Santonio Holmes, and Derrick Mason purportedly moved toward mentor Ryan to address hostile organizer Brian Schottenheimer's framework. Ryan, in the mean time, had started to disconnect himself from the remainder of the group as he turned out to be less "involved" and picked to have his partners mentor the players at their individual positions. Ryan pulled in further regard for the group amid a "Sunday Night Football" match-up against the New England Patriots when he reacted to a harassing fan with a vulgar comment and was fined $75,000 by the class. Regardless of attempting to a 8â 7 record, the Jets still had the capacity to accomplish a playoff compartment on the off chance that they won their standard season finale against the Miami Dolphins in blend with the result of three different recreations played that day.

For the 2013 battle, Ryan upgraded his training staff, elevating Dennis Thurman to cautious organizer while including a few new mentors including hostile facilitator Marty Mornhinweg. Recently contracted general supervisor John Idzik underscored there would be rivalry at all positions including quarterback. The Jets drafted Geno Smith in the second round of the 2013 NFL Draft to rival Sanchez. Ryan was broadly condemned for his choice to embed Sanchez late in a preseason diversion against the New York Giants after Sanchez endured a season-finishing shoulder damage which prompted Smith being named the starter. 

Through their initial nine rounds of the year, the Jets went 5â 4 and earned Ryan some early Coach of the Year thought. The group continued to lose their next three challenges as the new kid on the block Smith submitted eight turnovers while neglecting to score amid that extend. This incited hypothesis by experts with respect to whether Ryan would be terminated. The Jets broke their losing streak with a 37â 27 prevail upon the Raiders that kept them in playoff dispute.

Ryan was employed as the eighteenth head mentor of the Buffalo Bills on January 12, 2015, consenting to a five-year, $27.5 million contract. 

The Bills opened the 2015 season with a 27â 14 prevail upon the Indianapolis Colts. Disappointed by the Bills driving the NFL in punishments heading into their Week 5 amusement against the Tennessee Titans, Ryan gave the whole group wristbands with the message "Yes sir". These were the main words he needed his players to use with authorities in the event that they were hailed. In the wake of being hailed multiple times in Week 4 misfortune against the New York Giants, the Bills were punished just multiple times in their 14-13 triumph over the Titans. The Bills entered their bye week with a 3â 4 record subsequent to losing in London to the Jacksonville Jaguars. 

Ryan gave the entire group the week off amid the bye, and he himself found a disconnected shoreline to "escape and core interest". The Bills left their bye week and crushed the Miami Dolphins by a score of 33â 17, improving their season record to 4â 4. Ryan is presently 2â 5 record-breaking following a bye week.

The Bills were unfit to make the playoffs in their first season with Ryan as mentor, as they were disposed of in Week 15 with a 35â 25 misfortune to the Washington Redskins on December 20, stretching out their dry season to 16 seasons, the NFL's longest dynamic dry season. They completed the season with a 8â 8 record. 

On January 10, 2016, it was reported that Ryan had employed his twin sibling. Burglarize, to the Bills training staff. Ransack filled in as an associate head mentor and furthermore worked with the barrier. After three days, Ryan enlisted previous NFL champion Ed Reed to be an associate guarded backs mentor. 

The Bills opened the 2016 season with a 13â 7 misfortune against the Baltimore Ravens. On September 16, 2016, under 24 hours in the wake of losing 37â 31 to the Jets in their home opener and tumbling to 0â 2, Ryan terminated hostile facilitator Greg Roman and advanced running backs mentor Anthony Lynn to hostile organizer. 

On December 27, after a Christmas Eve misfortune to the Miami Dolphins in Week 16 that dispensed with the group from playoff conflict, Ryan was diminished of his obligations as head mentor, and hostile facilitator Anthony Lynn was named as interval head mentor for the last round of the period. Burglarize Ryan was rejected also. Numerous players were unfit to flourish under Ryan's protective plan, which was depicted as confused.

Ryan stresses that mentors are basically expected to be open and informative with the players and the executives, who thus will respond a similar disposition. By interfacing with his partners, Ryan states, it's "important with regards to making sense of how to persuade someone (...) on the grounds that I need that person to battle for me, much the same as I need to battle for him." Fullback Tony Richardson, in a meeting, expressed Ryan "adores his football crew, cherishes his players" and does as much as he can to guarantee their prosperity. In spite of his rowdy and reckless remarks that have caused expanded media inclusion of the group, Ryan has taken the consideration and has figured out how to "[put] it on himself" so the players can concentrate on their errands.

In 2011, the Jets endeavored to change over to a more pass-arranged offense, which have turned out to be all the more generally utilized in the NFL, in any case, the group battled with this modification and returned to their previous run-situated offense by the center of the period. His protective procedure, conversely, will in general be increasingly detailed thinking about his involvement in the field. There are six diverse guarded developments used in football, yet the two generally utilized arrangements are the 3â 4 arrangement, with three cautious lineman and four linebackers, and the 4â 3 arrangement, with four protective lineman and three linebackers. The Jets used the previous of the two prominent arrangements; in any case, Ryan would in general utilize every one of the six developments in shifting structures. Moreover, he regularly considers audibles that have the safeguard line up in one arrangement and change to another in order to shroud their expectations and confound and weight the adversary. 

As a demonstration of this logic, Ryan is frequently eager to concede the coin hurl to the rival so his group can start the amusement playing on protection so as to "set the tone" and produce turnovers. This idea has been scrutinized by ESPN correspondent John Clayton, who has observed the technique to be insufficient association wide.
