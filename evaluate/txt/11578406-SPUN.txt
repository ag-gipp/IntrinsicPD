Notwithstanding the character's appearances in the anime arrangement "D.Gray-man" and its continuation "D.Gray-man Hallow", he has showed up in three light books, two computer games and a few hybrid battling recreations. 

Manga maker Katsura Hoshino initially had no designs to make Allen's character in "D.Gray-man"; she needed the Millennium Earl to be the story's hero. Hoshino found the Earl unacceptable for use as a fundamental character in a manga magazine went for young people so she made Allen. Hoshino figured a develop configuration would be better; despite the fact that she trusted his last structure looked best dressed with a Black Order uniform, she pondered whether it ought to be progressively manly. Hoshino said she didn't have an inkling how Allen begun; she prefers her principle characters to be boisterous, impolite blockheads. She said the general thought for his plan was a "fiery youth with muddled fly-a-way hair", yet when he was drawn with the uniform of the Black Orderâthe gathering Allen goes along withâshe detected an "absence of coordination". To have a greater effect with Allen's entry to the Black Order, Hoshino gave him the moniker "Destroyer of Time", which has no importance to the story. 

Hoshino put together Allen with respect to Robin, the hero of her one-shot comic "Zone". Looking at the two, she considered Allen an "alternate sort of kid". As indicated by Hoshino's first supervisor, Allen was initially going to be a changed Akuma who resembled a kid. Her editorial manager exhorted her to make Allen progressively defenseless by delineating him crying, which prompted Allen's sexual orientation being male to have a greater effect with the perusers. As the manga proceeded, Hoshino considered him a friend and found a connection among herself and the character, in spite of the fact that Hoshino still respected the Millennium Earl. 

While making the character, Hoshino was apprehensive perusers may disdain Allen since she kept in touch with him as a wolf in sheep's clothing; despite the fact that Allen is a human, he has compassion toward his adversaries, the spirits caught inside the Akumas and the Noah family. Hoshino disliked Allen due to his negative activities notwithstanding his minding words. She likewise pondered whether perusers would think about a hero who is well disposed with the two his companions and his adversaries. In spite of her stresses, Hoshino's proofreader said it would be certain if Allen stayed as a fraud until the consummation. Regardless of troubles recorded as a hard copy him, Hoshino preferred the test of composing Allen, expecting that future manga heroes likewise give creators this issue. 

Allen was presented as a "man of his word" yet his portrayal changed to the point that Hoshino composed a meeting between the character and herself. In the meeting she griped to Allen about his change from "unadulterated and guiltless" to an "adulterated" character, calling him "Dim Allen". "Allen" answered that the change must be because of the arrangement's dull setting. She exhibited Allen's clouded side when the character struck his lord Cross Marian in outrage at his powerlessness to figure out how he would turn into the fourteenth Noah relative: Nea D. Campbell. As indicated by Hoshino, Cross Marian was irate with Allen for the assault yet delighted in observing this side of his understudy. While Allen turned into a darker character, Hoshino likewise needed to symbolize his own dread in the manner in which his persona ended up apprehensive his late watchman Mana Walker did not adore him. Therefore, Hoshino made a minor plan change and modified the scar Mana's Akuma set on his brow in a berserker state; by having the scar show all the more plainly, Allen's aggravation about his adoration for Mana was all the more unmistakably communicated. For the bend including the Third Exorcists, Hoshino's editors exhorted her to draw Allen as a contender for the manga's characters Yu Kanda and Alma Karma, who are intensely highlighted in the adventure. 

Hoshino drew Allen with hair longer than Robin's and thought that it was hard to settle on a haircut. She separated his hair in the inside to accentuate his outward appearances. Since he is an exorcist, she needed him to have a "frightening looking picture" and included the scar his left temple; the scar changed shape a few times before turning into a pentagram. Since Hoshino needed the Order and its adversaries to have visual complexity, she gave Allen and the Exorcists dark shrouds to pass on a "miserable" impression. Allen's dress is drawn from Hoshino's general impression of the late nineteenth century; his strip tie and different adornments are planned to extend a "polite picture". 

As indicated by Hoshino, later in the arrangement Allen's hairdo winds up like that of a Super Saiyanâa change in the "Mythical serpent Ball" arrangement in which the character's hair ends up spiky. Hoshino said that right on time in "D.Gray-man"s distribution, Allen was a standout amongst the most troublesome characters to draw.

Hoshino said she encountered an absence of motivation in what it would be its actual structure to the point of inclination Allen's dissatisfaction at not having the capacity to battle once more. In the long run, Hoshino was propelled to draw Allen's genuine Innocenceâthe Crowned Clownâwhich depends on the Italian Pierrot. She was happy with Allen's exchange that he would battle for the two people and Akumas, symbolized by his two hands, and drew this scene cautiously. By the arrangement's start, Hoshino proposed Allen's weaponry to develop in light of the fact that she began feeling that Allen's first weapon, Cross, may advance the perusers. Crown Clown was made to be a progressively beautiful and cooler weapon for Allen. Since Allen conceals his personality from the Order yet at the same time professes to be an exorcist in a later circular segment, Hoshino imagined another plan for him that speaks to his self-announcement of being one. 

Allen leaves the Black Order in light of the fact that the past story circular segment had such a large number of characters and required an excessive amount of exertion. Hoshino was satisfied with her depiction of Allen's valediction to companion Lenalee Lee since it implies the character's development. She noticed that Allen had become taller; right off the bat in the arrangement he and Lenalee are delineated at a similar stature. Hoshino said in spite of the fact that Allen's takeoff fits the arrangement's heartbreaking topic, he would dependably have companions. Allen and Kanda, regardless of their continuous contentions, part on great terms; Hoshino said Kanda would help Allen in the following story. Allen's withdrawal from the Order had been arranged since he experienced the adversary Road Kamelot on the grounds that Allen's inclination clashes with those of different Exorcists, who not at all like him don't wish to spare the Akumas.

Since "Hop Square"â the manga's host magazine at the timeâwas gone for a youthful male group of onlookers, Hoshino said she needed to describe Allen as a bright individual as opposed to a grieved adolescent. She discovered this portrayal troublesome in light of the fact that his life turned out to be increasingly convoluted as the arrangement advanced. Hoshino endeavors to adjust Allen among "quality and distress", and has required intermittent rests. She said the most moving piece of Allen's face to draw is his grin; he frequently grins, here and there when he is lying or despondent. After Allen left the Order, Hoshino told perusers his life may be difficult and that he would cheat at betting, which learns while preparing with Cross Marian.

Amid chronicles of "Honor", Hoshino was astounded by Murase's work, discovering him reasonable for Allen. Murase's exchanging between two identitiesâAllen and the Nea D. Campbellâinspired the manga creator, who thought at first Murase was utilizing a machine to change the tone of them. Despite the fact that Murase just showed up with the Millennium Earl twice in "Honor", his activity left a positive impression. Amid a communicate of "Honor", Hoshino made numerous delineations of Allen interfacing with the Noah family to help the performing artists.
