He effectively connected for a commission and left for Egypt on board HMAT "Ascanius" on 9Â June as a second lieutenant. In the wake of preparing in Egypt, he withdrew with his unit for Gallipoli on board the vehicle "Ivernia" on 4Â September. He was elevated to lieutenant on 25Â October. The 28th Battalion, which had been sent to Gallipoli late in the battle as fortifications, was not intensely connected on the promontory, and endured generally couple of losses before the withdrawal in December 1915. 

In March 1916, Phillipps was conveyed to France with the 28th Battalion for administration on the Western Front.

No. 2 Squadron changed over to Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s in January 1918. The unit by and large led watches with flights of six airplane yet thought that it was hard to bait adversary warriors into battle, so after a respite in battling right off the bat in February it started flying two-plane missions, which yielded better outcomes. The next month, as the German Spring Offensive got going, Phillipps shot down three German warriors in the same number of days: a Fokker Triplane on 22Â March, an Albatros the following morning, and a two-seater on 24Â March; the official history of Australia in the war recorded that the last-referenced foe lost its wings to Phillipps' assault rifle shoot, and "fell like a stone". With the Allies holding clear prevalence over the German contenders, the primary peril to the Australians was from ground shoot as most battle occurred at low dimension, and "their machines returned loaded with shot openings". On 27Â March, Phillipps accomplished two additional triumphs, a Triplane that he sent down on fire close Albert and another German contender over MÃ©aulte.

Ejecting his bombs to ease his burden, he assaulted one of the German contenders and shot away its wing; the others withdrew. Amid the Allies' Hundred Days Offensive, on 12Â August, he joined individual No.Â 2 Squadron pro Adrian Cole and No.Â 4 Squadron pros Harry Cobby and Roy King to lead their consolidated powers in help of the British Fourth Army, Phillipps representing a Fokker that separated in mid-air.
