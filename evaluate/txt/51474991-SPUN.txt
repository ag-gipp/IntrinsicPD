Illinois Centennial half dollar 

The Illinois Centennial half dollar is a dedicatory 50-penny piece struck by the United States Bureau of the Mint in 1918. The front, delineating Abraham Lincoln, was structured by Chief Engraver George T. Morgan; the turn around, in light of the Seal of Illinois, was by his right hand and successor, John R. Sinnock. Morgan's front depends on the statue by Andrew O'Connor. 

A dedicatory was needed by the State of Illinois to check the centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union, and in 1918, enactment was acquainted into Congress with achieve this. It met no resistance, however a few changes were made amid the administrative procedure. After it passed, the two etchers created structures, however Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo required changes, not which were all made. 

The coins were stamped in August 1918, and were sold to the general population for $1 each. All sold, however many were held by a bank until 1933, and the benefits used to settle the expense of nearby centennial festivals or to help those in need on account of World War I. Later journalists have commonly appreciated the coin, thinking of it as one of the more attractive American commemoratives. The coin is esteemed in the many dollars today, however extraordinary examples may exchange for additional. 

The State of Illinois needed a memorial coin to be issued for the centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union. A bill that would achieve this, H.R. 8764, was brought into the U.S. Place of Representatives on January 16, 1918 by that state's Loren E. Wheeler. It was alluded to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, which held hearings on March 5. Wheeler told the board (of which he was not a part) that the coins were wanted for dissemination amid the festivals in Illinois. He had been to see Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo and Mint Director Raymond T. Bread cook. Neither had any protest to the enactment, however McAdoo had clarified that the issue with memorial coins was that they didn't sell just as expected, and many were come back to the Mint for liquefying. In the wake of recounting his gathering with the authorities, Wheeler disclosed to the board that the coins would be bought by the State Treasurer of Illinois thus there would be no profits. James L. Slayden of Texas asked what the expense to the government would be, yet Wheeler did not know. Slayden approached what had been the expense for the 1916â 1917 McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar, and Ohio's William A. Ashbrook, the director of the board of trustees, said that the expense of the passes on had been borne by the gathering buying the coins from the administration; Ashbrook proposed altering the bill to make this unmistakable this would be a cost to be paid by Illinois. Wheeler had no protest, and expressed that to stay away from returns, it may be ideal if the issue was constrained to 100,000 coins as opposed to the 200,000 in the first bill. Ashbrook then inquired as to whether the coins were to be sold at a higher cost than normal by the centennial panel, and Wheeler denied this, demonstrating they were to be flowed like some other half dollar. This closed the formal proceeding on the bill, with the advisory group to make further move in official session. 

On March 12, Ashbrook presented a report for the benefit of his board prescribing entry of the bill once it had been changed to decrease the approved mintage from 200,000 to 100,000 and to include an explanation that the United States government would not be in charge of the expense of the kicks the bucket. 

Wheeler displayed the bill on the floor of the House of Representatives on April 6, 1918. He was tested by North Carolina's Claude Kitchin, who asked whether there had been a consistent proposal by the board of trustees, regardless of whether McAdoo and Baker had affirmed the bill, and whether there was point of reference for a half dollar out of appreciation for a state's centennial (there was definitely not). Wheeler consoled Kitchin with regards to the unanimity of the advisory group, and the endorsement by the authorities, however did not respond to the centennial inquiry conclusively, rather refering to occurrences of earlier dedicatory issues (the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Panama-Pacific memorial coins). Ashbrook interceded, guaranteeing Kitchin that his board of trustees had collectively affirmed it. Kitchin had no more inquiries, and the House affirmed the bill without a recorded vote. 

H. R. 8742 was transmitted to the Senate, where it was alluded to the Committee on Banking and Currency. That panel's executive, Oklahoma's Robert L. Owen, revealed it back with a change to the full Senate, where the bill was considered on May 21, 1918. The House-passed bill had said the laws identifying with the minor coinage of the United States (the penny and nickel) would apply to the coin; this was changed to express that the laws identifying with the backup silver coinage (which the half dollar was) would apply. The bill was passed as altered without protest. Later in the day, Illinois Senator James Hamilton Lewis created an impression which was embedded in the "Congressional Record" now, cheering the entry of the respect to his home state, and taking note of that "in excess of a hundred thousand of her children" were then being conveyed to the combat zones of World War I. 

Since the adaptations the two houses had passed were not indistinguishable, the bill came back to the House of Representatives, where on May 25, Arizona's Carl Hayden effectively moved that the House consent to the Senate revision. The Speaker, Champ Clark, felt that the title of the bill may must be changed for reasons he didn't clarify, yet Hayden differ and Clark did not squeeze his point. The bill passed the House, and was sanctioned by the mark of President Woodrow Wilson on June 1, 1918. 

The structures were arranged inside in the Engraving Department at the Philadelphia Mint. The front-side plan, portraying Abraham Lincoln, was made by Chief Engraver George T. Morgan. The Chief Engraver worked from a photo of a statue of Lincoln structured by Andrew O'Connor and disclosed in Springfield (the city where Lincoln lived for a lot of his grown-up life) in August 1918. Lincoln is appeared, as he was when living in Illinois before he was chosen president in 1860. He was picked to be on the coin as Illinois' most well known occupant. The front contains the mottoes and , just as an engraving noticing the centennial. 

The turn around was planned by the associate etcher who might succeed Morgan on his passing in 1925, John R. Sinnock. It is an adjustment of the Seal of Illinois, a hawk roosted on a stone hill, with the rising sun past it. The winged creature holds in its nose a look with the Illinois state maxim, and it grasps the Federal shield. An olive branch is seen, however with no bolts speaking to war, despite the fact that these images are regularly matched on U.S. coins. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen recommended "their quality on a coin structured amid the finishing up a very long time of World War I may have been viewed as slightly crude". The invert likewise bears the legends, , (the national aphorism, signifying "out of many, one") and . 

Secretary McAdoo had initially dismissed the entries. Acting Mint Director Mary M. O'Reilly kept in touch with Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce on June 24, 1918, transferring the Treasury Secretary's worries. McAdoo "explicitly direct[ed]" that the Illinois state witticism be erased from the look in the falcon's bill on the switch, to be supplanted with the national one. Joyce was advised to pursue the arrangements of the Coinage Act of 1873 requiring that on one side there be the word , a plan symbolic of it, and the time of striking, with the opposite side a bird with the name of the nation and the group of the coin. In spite of McAdoo's structure, the Illinois engraving was held on the parchment. Wear Taxay, in his book on commemoratives, conjectured it may have been the Illinois Centennial Commission that had demanded this. 

Later pundits have applauded the coin. Taxay regarded the front-side "without a doubt the best work Morgan at any point did in his forty-eight years with the Mint. The head isn't simply well drawn, there is in it a profundity of inclination, and thoughtful state of mind that nearly makes the eyewitness feel he is barging in on the incredible man." Writers on memorial coins, including Arlie Slabaugh and David M. Bullowa, additionally respected the Illinois piece. Q. David Bowers considered Sinnock's turn around "the best work he at any point accomplished for a legitimate delicate coin", not barring the Roosevelt dime (1946) and Franklin half dollar (1948, after death). Arbors noticed that the fringe of the two sides of the coin comprises of dots and pellets, "an alluring substitute for denticles". 

Workmanship student of history Cornelius Vermeule, in his 1971 book on the aestheticness of American coins and decorations, composed that "Morgan's understanding has caught the fretful pliancy of [O'Connor's] bust, one more sign of the advantages for coin structure of good grand models in figure". He noted of Sinnock's turn around, "the little burst of sun at the privilege is very nearly a bow to the Rotyâ Saint-Gaudensâ Weinman advancements outside the Philadelphia Mint in American numismatic taste and iconography in the age following 1900. Sinnock's creation can be called traditional, yet the whole atmosphere of the coin reflects American workmanship after the Civil War, and this is maybe genuinely proper for the main [pre-1954] dedicatory coin to respect Abraham Lincoln." 

A sum of 100,058 Illinois Centennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint amid August 1918, with the abundance over the round number held for assessment and testing at the 1919 gathering of the yearly Assay Commission. There was no official bundling; a couple were utilized in identifications for the Illinois Centennial Commission. The coins were not pitched much outside Illinois. The centennial commission circulated them, without needing any proof, to its region offshoots in extent to a lot of Illinois' populace, on condition they be sold including some built-in costs to help pay for neighborhood festivities, and in the event that one had just been held, for war alleviation. 

The coins were likewise sold by the Springfield Chamber of Commerce at $1 each, however some were in the end distributed for less: Texas coin seller B. Max Mehl obtained a few thousand at simply over presumptive worth. A neighborhood bank held 30,000 of them for a long time, and sold them amid the 1933 Bank Holiday for a slight development on par. This briefly overwhelmed the market, yet they were consumed amid the principal dedicatory coin blast in 1936, however the cost did not then ascent from the $1.25 they had sold for since around 1925. At the tallness of the second dedicatory coin blast in 1980, uncirculated examples sold for about $300. The release of R. S. Yeoman's "A Guide Book of United States Coins" distributed in 2017 records the coin for somewhere in the range of $130 and $685, contingent upon condition. An outstanding example sold at closeout in 2014 for $7,040.
