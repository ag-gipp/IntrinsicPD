The characters and cast from the Broadway generation are recorded beneath: 

Leta Vance Nicholson, a film situation essayist, composed the main form of "The Blue Flame". She sold it to showy operator Walter C. Jordan, who had it reworked by George V. Hobart and John Willard. Jordan paid the three essayists $10,000 for their work (about $ in dollars), at that point exchanged the play to maker Albert H. Woods for $35,000. 

Performing artist Theda Bara was a standout amongst the most mainstream stars of quiet movies. From her first driving job as "the Vampire" in the 1915 film "A Fool There Was", Bara had been pigeonholed as a "vamp" or femme fatale who tempted and destroyed honest men. In spite of the fact that she once in a while performed in movies assuming different kinds of jobs, these were not as effective economically as her "vamp" films. She assumed many comparative jobs while contracted with Fox Film from 1915 to 1919. 

After Bara's agreement with Fox finished, Woods moved toward her about showing up in a play. She had performed in front of an audience right off the bat in her profession, working with visiting organizations and in summer stock, yet had not performed on Broadway. Bara told a journalist that she was offered a couple of contents to consider, and picked "The Blue Flame" (around then titled "The Lost Soul") since it enabled her to play two variants of the character, one great and the other terrible. She likewise trusted moving to the stage would bring her new vocation openings. Woods gave Bara a rewarding contract. Every week she got a compensation of $1500. This was significantly not exactly the $4000 every week she had earned in her last year with Fox, however Bara was additionally guaranteed a large portion of the creation's net benefits. For instance, the play's fourteen day keep running in Boston got Bara $10,700. Woods likewise gave a finely named private railroad vehicle to take her from city to city when the show visited. 

Woods employed two chiefs, J. C. Huffman and W. H. Gilmore, to help with the generation. The creation started with a progression of review exhibitions in February 1920, showing up in Pittsburgh; Washington, D.C.; Stamford, Connecticut; and Chicago. The last exhibitions before the Broadway head were in Boston toward the beginning of March. 

While the show was still in sneak peaks, essayist Owen Davis guaranteed the story had been lifted from his before play "Lola", which had showed up quickly on Broadway in March 1911, at that point was adjusted as a motion picture in 1914. He recorded a claim, yet before the finish of May it was settled with a money installment to Davis. 

The show opened on Broadway at the Shubert Theater on March 15, 1920. It had a kept running of 48 exhibitions and shut in late April. The show then proceeded to different urban areas on visit. The play was additionally advanced by the arrival of sheet music for a signature tune, with Bara's picture included unmistakably on the spread. William Frederic Peters composed the music and Ballard MacDonald composed the verses for the tune, which was distributed in April by Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. 

The visit shut on January 1, 1921. "The Blue Flame" was Bara's last Broadway execution and her last acting visit. She completed a period of vaudeville visiting, yet did not act in it; rather she chatted with crowds and recounted anecdotes about her profession. Her solitary resulting stage acting was in a Little Theater creation of "Bella Donna" in 1934. Bara's movie vocation was additionally winding down. She acted in just a single element film after "The Blue Flame" finished, the 1925 show "The Unchastened Woman". 

The play got overwhelmingly negative audits, albeit a few faultfinders had minor compliments for Bara. Biographer Eve Golden depicted the surveys of Bara's going about as "nothing not exactly awful", however the analysis about the play all in all was considerably increasingly negative. "Assortment" expected Bara to attract crowds to the auditorium for something like half a month, yet said suppositions in the every day press were joined about how terrible the play was. In "The New York Times", Alexander Woollcott derided the discourse, which included lines, for example, "Have you brought the cocaine?" and "You make my heart snicker and I feel like a lady of the avenues." Delivered genuinely, this exchange drew chuckling from the gathering of people. Woollcott featured one specific line: "I will be so terrible, I'll be recollected dependably." He said Bara was awful, yet not sufficiently awful to be paramount. He credited her for talking plainly and for not losing her poise when the gathering of people giggled at her. Different analysts gave Bara also swoon acclaim: she had "normal capability" or "was not all that terrible". Some complimented her looks or her breathtaking closet. 

Different analysts were significantly increasingly negative, denouncing Bara alongside the play for the most part. The theater pundit for "Munsey's Magazine" cited a few negative surveys and contrasted Bara's acting horribly with that of show school understudies. The "Brooklyn Daily Eagle" said she satisfied the guarantee to be exceptionally terrible, calling her acting "outlandish". "The Sun and New York Herald" said Bara's acting was frustrating and the play was "appalling in knowledge and every one of that contacts the craft of the theater". In "Ainslee's Magazine", Dorothy Parker said the play's creators had taken the line about being associated with disagreeableness "as their working adage", and recommended the groups at the exhibitions were there to assault the dramatists. In the "New-York Tribune", Heywood Broun recommended that the whole generation organization should fear the fierceness of God for such a horrendous play. 

Students of history and pundits thinking back on the play have confirmed the negative appraisal. Biographer Ronald Genini called the play "agonizingly awful" and depicted the surveys as "a panning bash". Theater student of history Ward Morehouse portrayed it as "one of the most noticeably bad plays ever composed". Artistic commentator Edward Wagenknecht said Bara's interest helped end her acting vocation. Brilliant asked why Bara played the job, hypothesizing that just "distress and unimaginably misguided thinking" could have clarified her interest. 

Generally speaking the play was a colossal budgetary achievement; the reviews broke participation records. In Boston, the show sold out even after the expansion of additional matinÃ©es. The principal week on Broadway took in about $20,000, near the most extreme the Shubert Theater could produce at ordinary costs. Be that as it may, ticket deals tumbled off quickly following the unequivocally negative audits. Woods pre-sold a month of tickets to nearby ticket agents, which helped the movies aggregates, however the merchants were left with unsold seats even subsequent to offering profound limits. In the wake of leaving New York, the show came back to solid deals out and about.
