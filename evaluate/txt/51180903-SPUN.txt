"San Junipero" is the fourth scene of arrangement three of "Dark Mirror"; each of the six scenes in this arrangement were at the same time discharged on Netflix on 21 October 2016. While arrangement one and two of "Dark Mirror" were appeared on Channel 4 in the UK, Netflix appointed the arrangement for 12 scenes (split into two arrangement of six scenes) in September 2015 with an offer of $40 million, and in March 2016, Netflix outbid Channel 4 for the privilege to disseminate arrangement three in the UK. Because of its turn to Netflix, the show had a bigger spending plan than in past arrangement, and a bigger scene request which enabled the show to differ its kind and tone more than past arrangement. Close by arrangement three scene "Plunge", "San Junipero" was first appeared 2016 in front of its Netflix discharge at the Toronto International Film Festival. 

"San Junipero" was the primary content created for arrangement three, composed by Charlie Brooker as a "cognizant choice to change the arrangement". The show recently centered around innovation's negative impacts; this scene filled in as confirmation that inspiring "Dark Mirror" scenes are conceivable. 

Brooker at first imagined a scene in which innovation is utilized to explore whether an existence in the wake of death exists, thinking about the class of frightfulness and extraordinary fiction. He later ended up enlivened by wistfulness treatment for more seasoned individuals. Brooker and official maker Annabel Jones felt that their idea of virtual cognizance, set up in the scene "White Christmas", had increasingly potential. One of Brooker's unique ideas depended on the scene "Be Right Back", in which expired people's identities are transferred into counterfeit elements in an amusement park that relatives can visit. This thought was rejected with the 2016 communicate of "Westworld", in which androids go around an amusement park. He at that point reviewed the 2010 BBC arrangement "The Young Ones", in which more seasoned famous people live in a home enriched in the style of the 1970s and end up restored by the setting. Having more than once suspected of composing a scene set previously, Brooker expressed "San Junipero" as a period scene. 

Brooker has said that he composed the content for the scene in four days. In the underlying draft, the romantic tale was about a hetero couple, yet Brooker transformed it to give the scene an additional reverberation, as same-sex marriage was not legitimate in 1987. He has said that having a wind makes the composition procedure simpler, as "when you realize that 85 percent of what's going on you can't uncover till later on, it quite of strait your choices conveniently". One draft of the scene contained a scene where Kelly visits a kindergarten in San Junipero, loaded with kids who had passed on, however it was evacuated in light of the fact that "it was excessively miserable and excessively impactful of a note to hit in that story". Brooker picked the setting of California, an area in America as opposed to Britain, as an approach to "overturn" individuals' predispositions of "Dark Mirror". One commentator noticed that the majority of the characters in "San Junipero" are American. 

The scene was initially to have a despondent closure. Brooker told "The Daily Beast" that in the unpleasant treatment, the scene finished with the scene where Kelly and Yorkie meet in the emergency clinic, however "when I sat down to really compose it, I was getting a charge out of it so much that I thought, "No, I'm going to continue onward"!" He imagined Yorkie's killing and developed Kelly's backstory, keeping in touch with her enthusiastic discourse to Yorkie in one sitting. The closure came about when Brooker heard "Paradise is a Place on Earth" off a gushing playlist while composing the content, and needed to permit the melody for the scene. Subsequent to tuning in to the tune and verses a few times, he went to the last shot, which demonstrates a bank of PC servers with glimmering lights, giving strict load to the tune's title. An unused thought for the completion had the group of onlookers see Kelly and Yorkie in various periods, for example, the 1920s. 

Following the scene's discharge, Brooker was gotten some information about a Reddit post estimating that Kelly is reproduced for Yorkie's advantage, as opposed to truly there; he answered "Off-base! They are as one", and remarked that "[t]hey have the most joyful consummation possible. [...] it is anything but a major rainbow sandwich, yet what seems, by all accounts, to be going on there, is going on there." 

The dance club settings highlighted arcade amusements, which Brooker looked into picking as he was a young person amid the 1980s and has filled in as a computer game columnist. Chief Owen Harris depicted the 1980s as a "period in life that was extremely hopeful". He picked the year 1987 "decently discretionarily" and referenced "quite certain motion picture publications" in the content. Brooker set up together a playlist of music from 1987 on Spotify. A few melodies, for example, Belinda Carlisle's "Paradise Is a Place on Earth" and the Smiths' "Better half in a Coma", allude to the scene's plot wind, as do arcade diversions "Time Crisis" and "The House of the Dead". Every melody must be cleared for approximately 15 years for Netflix. Each tune was effectively cleared aside from one by Prince. 

"Paradise Is a Place on Earth" plays at the scene's start and over the end credits. Brooker first heard it while running, and trusted it would be ideal for the last scene, conceding in a meeting he would have been "totally troubled" on the off chance that they had been unfit to utilize it. "Sweetheart in a Coma" includes in the scene "for around five seconds", yet cost "an over the top measure of cash", Brooker said. Jones said the melody's incorporation "was liberal and yet, it was important to the point that we set up that period so it felt extraordinary". Robbie Nevil's tune "What a life" was picked by Harris, as it was one of the principal singles he at any point obtained. 

The scene additionally highlighted a unique score by Clint Mansell. Mansell was drawn closer by Harris, and based the score around the recently picked tunes, including "Paradise Is a Place on Earth". He has said that the "quiet electronic" score was affected by John Hughes motion pictures and the passing of his sweetheart a year prior. In December 2016, Lakeshore Records discharged the score for downloading and spilling. 

Gugu Mbatha-Raw, who plays Kelly, had known about the show yet not seen it when she got the content, however she watched the arrangement two scene "Be Right Back" before the shoot.

They didn't film in the United States as a cost-cutting measure. Mbatha-Raw said there was brief period to practice, and she had little chance to meet Davis before shooting. Kelly's outfit was roused by VIPs of the 1980s, for example, Janet Jackson and Whitney Houston, while Yorkie's outfit "resembles her mum spread it out on her bed", as indicated by Davis. Her attire is consistent all through the scene to subvert a "changing nerd" figure of speech in fiction, likewise enabling her change to be inward as opposed to outside. 

The main day of recording was in London for the Quagmire dance club. For the club Tucker's, a 3D demonstrate was made, which Brooker and Harris saw with a computer generated simulation headset. Mbatha-Raw and Davis worked with a move choreographer and moved to Janet Jackson's "What Have You Done for Me Lately", however Alexander O'Neal's "Phony" was utilized in the last alter. The back road scene highlights downpour, which Harris demanded including in spite of Brooker's protestations that the recreated world would not have downpour.

He noticed that while shooting Kelly and Yorkie's contention on the shoreline, a "staggering fog came in from the sea", which made troubles however drove "some actually dazzling surface". Mbatha-Raw said that pretty much every scene was shot around evening time or sunset, especially the outside scenes. 

The scene contains clues paving the way to the uncover of the bend. For instance, the decision of the melody "Sweetheart in a Coma", and the utilization of the arcade diversions "Time Crisis" and "The House of the Dead" suggest the genuine truth of the scene. All the more clearly, Yorkie responds instinctively to seeing an auto collision in an arcade amusement, a component that Brooker was shocked was not gotten by watchers before. A factor considered amid the altering procedure was the manner by which unmistakable the insights ought to be. Annabel Jones said that "there might be visual signifiers that you believe were getting down to business and afterward didn't, so you need more work in the alter". Modifications were likewise made utilizing sound plan systems, for example, audio cues.
