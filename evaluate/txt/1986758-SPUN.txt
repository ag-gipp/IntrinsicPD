Herschel Greer Stadium 

Herschel Greer Stadium is a relinquished Minor League Baseball park in Nashville, Tennessee, on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War stronghold, around south of the city's downtown region. The office has been shut and unused since the finish of the 2014 baseball season, and left since mid 2015. , the arena is as yet standing, yet the city hopes to start obliteration in mid 2019 preceding reincorporating the land into Fort Negley Park. 

Greer was opened in 1978 for the Nashville Sounds, a development establishment of the Double-A Southern League who moved to the Triple-An American Association in 1985 and to the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998. The arena played host to the group until 2014. The subject of various updates and fixes to keep up its usefulness, Greer ended up one of the most seasoned arenas utilized by a Triple-A group, and before the finish of its utilization had fallen well underneath expert baseball's measures for an arena at that class level. For over 10 years, the Sounds endeavored to verify concurrences with the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County for another ballpark to supplant Greer, in the end bringing about the development of First Tennessee Park, which turned into the Sounds' new home in 2015. 

In the midst of the Sounds' 37-season run, Greer all the while facilitated two expert baseball clubs in 1993 and 1994, going about as a transitory home to an uprooted Southern League establishment referred to amid that period as the Nashville Xpress. The arena additionally observed infrequent use as a setting for school baseball, secondary school football, and philanthropy softball occasions. It has been the site of three small time top pick amusements, eight no-hitters, including one immaculate diversion, and a 24-inning amusement which tied the record for the longest diversion in Pacific Coast League history. The arena is best perceived by its unmistakable guitar-formed scoreboard. 

Larry Schmittou, the pioneer of a push to take proficient baseball back to Nashville in the late 1970s, realized he would need to manufacture another ballpark for his group as the city's past ballpark, Sulfur Dell, had been obliterated in 1969. He gained from an individual from the Metro Board of Parks and Recreation that neither the Parks Board or the city of Nashville would pay for such a recreation center. In this way, Schmittou, alongside assistance from nation performer Conway Twitty, set up together a gathering of financial specialists including other blue grass craftsmen Cal Smith and Jerry Reed, just as different Nashvillians, to back an arena and a small time group. The Metro Parks Board consented to rent to Schmittou a plot of land at the foot of St. Cloud Hill on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortress, around south of downtown, for a time of 20Â years as long as he constructed an arena with a base limit of 6,500 at an expense of at any rate US$400,000 inside 10Â years. The city would likewise migrate the city-possessed softball complex that involved the site. Schmittou would be in charge of structure the arena, making good on the property regulatory obligations, and paying the city seven percent of the group's complete income in the second ten years. 

Stoll-Reed Architects educated Schmittou that development with respect to an appropriate arena would cost somewhere in the range of $300,000 and $500,000, however offers for the undertaking ran from $980,000 to $1.2Â million. Schmittou looked to neighborhood providers to give development materials, took out a $30,000 credit from a bank, sold season tickets ahead of time of having a group, and even sold his own home to help pay for the office. The real cost totaled $1.5Â million. The arena was after death named for Herschel Lynn Greer, a conspicuous Nashville agent and the main leader of the Nashville Vols baseball crew, whose family gave $25,000 for arena development. 

The home opener for Greer's first inhabitants, the Southern League's Nashville Sounds, Double-A partner of the Cincinnati Reds, was booked for April 25, 1978. Development was in progress, however Schmittou realized the ballpark would not be prepared by that date. The group mentioned to open the season with street amusements and needed to swap an arrangement with the Chattanooga Lookouts so as to have more opportunity to finish the arena. Indeed, even with this additional time, the ballpark was still behind timetable. A significant part of the grass that been laid that winter passed on. When the substitution grass had arrived, the group procured to lay the turf had left. General Manager Farrell Owens sorted out a volunteer group to lay the turf by calling a neighborhood radio station to declare the group was having a "grass party". A gathering of around 50Â people turned out to lay and roll the grass the day preceding the planned opening amusement. 

The planned April 25 Greer home opener was rained out and pushed back to the night of April 26. In the wake of playing their initial ten diversions from home, and with tractors and evaluating machines as yet setting up the field on amusement day, the Sounds played their first home amusement on April 26, 1978. The 12â 4Â victory against the Savannah Braves was seen by a sellout horde of 8,156 onlookers. Southern League president Billy Hitchcock was close by to observe the occasion, and Conway Twitty tossed out the principal pitch. On the field, Sounds catcher Joe Griffin drove the 16-hit Nashville offense with 5Â runs batted in (RBI) while beginning pitcher Bruce Berenyi got the success and closer Doug Corbett earned a spare. 

In spite of the fact that the arena was opened on schedule, the late turf was by all account not the only issue on opening day. The power was turned on just five minutes before the entryways opened. Just two ladies' bathrooms and one men's bathroom were working, however a couple of convenient toilets were likewise accessible. The arena's seats, which had recently been introduced in Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, arrived in the nick of time. Development of the screen was all the while being finished on opening day. Players for both the Sounds and the meeting Braves had worries about the security of playing on the immediately introduced infield, at first declining to play superficially. Left defenders grumbled about the additional precarious incline in left field that kept them from seeing home plate. The outfield grass was taken up and the dirt regraded to reduce this issue while the Sounds were away on an eight-day excursion. 

At first, Greer was equipped for seating 7,200Â spectators, yet was extended to 8,800 before the finish of the debut season. Theater-type seats with back help and armrests represented 3,000 of the arena's seats; grandstand seats made up the rest of. The press box included two radio communicate stalls and an organ corner. There were storage spaces for two groups, which each suited 25Â people, just as a storage space for umpires. The field estimated 330Â feet (100Â m) down the left and right field lines, 375Â feet (114Â m) to left-and right-focus fields, and 405Â feet (123Â m) to focus field. The home group involved the third base hole, and guests involved the a respectable starting point hole, with each group's warm up area situated in a foul area in the outfield corners. Eight lighting networks on steel shafts 100Â feet (30Â m) high given enlightenment to night recreations. Luxuries for clients at the recreation center included two people's bathrooms and seven snack bars. 

With the expansion of 5,000Â permanent seats, Greer's seating limit was expanded to 13,000 for the 1979 season. Enhancements to the playing field included new water system and seepage frameworks which raised the field 5Â feet (1.5Â m) over its past height. 

Preceding the 1981 season, Greer experienced various remodels including the expansion of over 1,200Â box seats and over 1,000Â new general affirmation seats. Two wooden general confirmation seating regions were supplanted by 2,000Â contoured seats. The first stopping board which comprised of a few steel posts was moved up to a steel link framework, wiping out a large portion of the shafts. Other arena redesigns included two new holes, three passageway and off-ramps, another sound framework, multiplying the extent of the peruser board on the scoreboard, and developing the ticket office. The ballpark's unsurpassed participation record was determined to August 18, 1982, when 22,315Â people watched the Sounds rout the Columbus Astros, 3â 0. Bits of the outfield must be restricted to suit the group, which was far in abundance of Greer's seating limit. 

From February through mid-summer 1984, noteworthy redesigns and increases were made to the office. A full-administration eatery, The Hall of Fame Stadium Club, and a smaller than normal rooftop, to cover the last five lines of the held seating area and the principle concourse, were fabricated. Another press box included lodging for extra individuals from the media, two separate stalls for home and visiting radio communicates, and two separate corners for home and visiting transmissions. Ten sky boxes were constructed contiguous the press box; by 1989, the quantity of sky boxes had expanded to 18. 

In July 1984, Schmittou acquired the Triple-An Evansville Triplets of the American Association. The group moved from Evansville to Nashville for the 1985 season, whereupon the Triplets' heritage was resigned and the establishment received the Sounds' name and history, successfully hoisting the association from Double-A to Triple-A. The Double-A Southern League establishment was moved to Huntsville, Alabama, where the group started play as the Huntsville Stars at the hurriedly built Joe W. Davis Stadium. 

To plan for the move to Triple-A, remodels proceeded preceding the 1985 season with the expansion of 1,200Â box seats, which supplanted a portion of the held show off seating, just as additionally seating past the correct field foul post. A 4-line scoreboard 10Â feet (3.0Â m) high supplanted the arena's unique, which was moved to far left field to fill in as an away scoreboard, giving scores to American League, National League, and American Association ball games. 

Schmittou's longing to arrive a Triple-A group was a piece of a bigger arrangement to set Nashville in a place to fight for a Major League Baseball establishment later on. Alongside this objective, the requirement for all the more seating, and a longing to make Greer an increasingly alluring ballpark, noteworthy remodels started after the 1987 season. The quantity of box seats was expanded by 40Â percent, the clubhouse and umpire offices were updated, and the holes were totally revamped. The new holes occupied marginally more space than the past ones, bringing about a minor withdrawal of the field's measurements: 327Â feet (100Â m) down the left and right field lines, 371Â feet (113Â m) to left and right-focus fields, and 400Â feet (120Â m) to focus field. The primary concourse entrance was updated to join the stonemasonry of the adjoining Fort Negley. This extension brought Greer's all out seating limit up to 18,000. 

In 1990, Major League Baseball (MLB) group proprietors satisfied to need that small time proprietors improve their ballparks so as to satisfy their ideal guidelines. Greer had effectively fallen behind different parks when it went to the nature of the field and clubhouse, and it additionally came up short on a weight room and batting confines. Following a fizzled offer to verify a MLB group for Nashville in the 1993 Major League Baseball extension process (Nashville was one of ten urban communities considered, yet was disposed of from conflict in all respects right off the bat all the while; the two new establishments were in the long run granted to Denver and Miami), Schmittou concentrated on downsizing his proposed MLB arena into another Triple-An office for the Sounds. When other Triple-A urban areas were fabricating new, generally rich ballparks, Schmittou was unfit to persuade civic chairman Phil Bredesen or the Metro Council to pay for such another park. He thought about moving the group to an encompassing area, and investigated locales in La Vergne, Cool Springs, and Mount Juliet. He even attempted, ineffectively, to get the Metro Council to pass a submission to give citizens a chance to cast a ballot on a transitory expense increment to satisfy a proposed $40Â million arena in three years. At last, Schmittou chose to keep the Sounds at Greer yet make noteworthy enhancements to the arena. 

Greer's particular guitar-molded scoreboard, made by the Fair-Play organization, was introduced behind the left-focus field divider preceding the 1993 season. Another expansion in 1993 was that of a second group to play at Greer. From 1993 to 1994, the ballpark all the while filled in as the home field for the Sounds and the Nashville Xpress, the Double-A member of the Minnesota Twins which played in the Southern League. This came about when Charlotte, North Carolina, procured a Triple-A development establishment in 1993, leaving the city's Double-A group, the Charlotte Knights, without a home. Schmittou offered Greer Stadium as an impermanent home for the group. So as to suit another club at Greer, the Xpress planned its home diversions amid the Sounds' travels. This denoted the first occasion when that two small time groups would work in a similar city since 1972, when the Charlotte Hornets and Charlotte Twins shared Calvin Griffith Park. 

The Xpress played their first home diversion at Greer on April 16, 1993, against the Orlando Cubs. Pitchers Todd Ritchie, Mike Misuraca, and Jason Klonoski constrained Cubs hitters to five hits and no keeps running in the 4â 0 shutout. Nashville's Brian Raabe multiplied in the second inning bringing home David Rivera and Rich Becker giving the Xpress every one of the runs they required. The amusement was gone to by only 1,715Â people on a harshly cool night. In April 1994, Michael Jordan's invasion into expert baseball pulled in 16,842Â fans to Greer to see the Xpress face his group, the Birmingham Barons, out of the blue that season. The Nashville Xpress played their keep going home diversion on September 1, 1994, against the Huntsville Stars. With Nashville holding a 1â 0 lead going into the eighth inning, Huntsville scored three keeps running in both the eighth and ninth innings while in transit to a 6â 2 annihilation of the home group. In 1995, the Xpress migrated to Wilmington, North Carolina, and turned into the Port City Roosters. 

Over $200,000 was spent on remodels in the fall and winter before the 1995 season. The home clubhouse and weight room were redesigned, passageways behind the burrows were reemerged to diminish tricky regions, and the whole playing field was re-sodded. This was the primary substitution and redesigning of the field since the first grass was laid in 1978. In the first place, the majority of the old grass was taken from the field. At that point, the grounds team introduced another waste framework. Four channels were burrowed and laid with 2,500Â feet (760Â m) of seepage pipe to divert water from the field and past the inside field divider. A layer of rock was laid over the pipe, and a 4-to-6-inch (10Â toÂ 15Â cm) layer of sand was set over the rock. In the wake of raising the dimension of the infield earth and block cautioning track to a similar tallness of the new field, 100,000Â square feet (9,300Â mÂ²) of Tifton 419 Bermuda Grass was introduced on the field and edged into a baseball field setup. 

The 1996 season denoted the last that Schmittou was the group's leader and part greater part proprietor. With the city arranged to respect a National Football League establishment, the Tennessee Titans, Schmittou felt that income would be drawn far from his baseball crew, so he and agent Walter Nipper sold their 59Â percent stake in the Sounds to Chicago-based businesspeople Al Gordon, Mike Murtaugh, and Mike Woleben. The new possession gathering, working as AmeriSports Companies LLC, repaired each region of the arena, including the snack bars, restrooms, concourse, arena outside, home clubhouse (a guest's clubhouse had been worked under the third base grandstands for the 1996 season), and parking garages. A few areas of seats in left field past third base were expelled and supplanted by tents and a gathering outing zone. This diminished the seating ability to 11,500. 

Following the 1997 season, the American Association was broken up, and the Sounds moved toward becoming individuals from the Pacific Coast League (PCL). Subsequently, Greer turned into the eastern-most arena in PCL history behind the Indianapolis Indians' Bush Stadium when that group played in the PCL from 1964 to 1968. Greer was the eastern-most dynamic PCL arena from 1998 to 2014. 

As customer inclinations changed and with an end goal to pull in bigger gatherings to the ballpark, in the late 1990s, Greer Stadium's fixed-seating limit was decreased to 10,300 by taking out the cheap seat areas along the third base side and past right field, and building three gathering decks in their places. Therefore, the general affirmation zone progressed toward becoming bound just to the current cheap seats behind the saved seating along the a respectable starting point line in right field. A fourth gathering territory was made by repurposing unused space on the grandstands behind home plate. Another deck was built behind the right-field foul shaft, which, now and again, included a rentable hot tub. 

The maturing Greer Stadium had never been intended to last longer than 30Â years, and was the subject of numerous remodels in the mid 2000s to fulfill least Triple-A guidelines. In 2003, the Sounds proposed another arena to be worked with a blend of open and private assets at the side of first Avenue South and Gateway Boulevard (presently Korean Veterans Boulevard) in Downtown Nashville on the previous site of the city's warm exchange vitality plant, focusing on an opening date in April 2006. Following two years of the Sounds campaigning for the new park and taking steps to leave town (either for suburbia or another city out and out), Mayor Bill Purcell consented to help fundamental designs for the arena on October 25, 2005, and the Nashville Metro Council endorsed the new arena on February 7, 2006, due to some degree to the Sounds verifying development financing through a consortium of banks, maintaining a strategic distance from citizen cost. The office was to be called First Tennessee Field. Opening day at the proposed scene was over and over pushed back, in the end to as late as April 2009. Be that as it may, the Sounds and private engineers Struever Brothers, Eccles, and Rouse were unfit to finish financing and configuration plans for the new arena by the April 15, 2007, due date set by the Metro Council. Thus, the First Tennessee Field development venture was dropped and the Sounds stayed at Greer with a questionable future. 

Following the disintegration of the designs for the new ballpark, and before the 2008 season, more than $1Â million in updates and fixes were made to Greer. The upgrades, which incorporated another clubhouse for the Sounds and visiting groups past the middle field divider, improved field lighting, and enhancements to bathrooms, walkways, and seating, were made so as to keep the arena useful for another three to five years. 

MFP Baseball, which bought the Sounds in mid 2009, contributed over $2Â million to make fixes and moves up to the maturing arena's playing field, bathrooms, snack bars, scoreboard, sound framework, and seating. The infield was re-sodded and leveled, defensive railing was introduced along the edge of the field, and the stopping board netting was supplanted. The whole concourse and guitar scoreboard were repainted, broken seats were supplanted, and the fourth-floor Sluggers Sports Bar and Grill was redesigned. A changeless show organize and a family fun zone were developed by the concourse entrance. 

In 2011, MFP Baseball and the Mayor's Office started moving in the direction of another arena, with the city distinguishing three potential destinations for development, and selecting arena manufacturer Populous to ponder each. The three destinations were a zone on the north end of The Gulch, the state-claimed parking garage on the site of Nashville's first ballpark (Sulfur Dell), and different territories legitimately neighboring Nissan Stadium and the eastern end of the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. The Sounds still favored the past Thermal site because of its closeness to the city's stimulation and focal business regions, yet the city was not willing to influence a second endeavor at an arena in that area (To rise Amphitheater was in the end worked there). City hall leader Karl Dean favored the Sulfur Dell site, trying to support monetary development on downtown's slow North side, while fusing the ballpark into the encompassing neighborhoods. In pre-fall 2013, the Sounds and the Nashville Metropolitan Government achieved a consent to assemble another $37Â million downtown ballpark at Sulfur Dell. Development on First Tennessee Park started after fundamental land-swaps with the State of Tennessee, and the new ballpark opened in time for the beginning of the 2015 season. 

Realizing that the 2014 season would be the group's 37th and last battle at the old ballpark, the Sounds propelled the "Last Cheer at Greer", a season-long festival of the arena that included gestures to its history and limited time giveaways to recognize the end. On August 27, 2014, the Sounds facilitated their last amusement at Greer Stadium: a 8â 5 misfortune to the Sacramento River Cats. In his solitary plate appearance of the night, Nashville catcher Lucas May hit out swinging with a full check and the bases stacked to end the amusement. Declared participation at the diversion was a standing-room-just horde of 11,067, the main sellout since 2010, and the biggest group since 2007. 

After the Sounds' managerial workplaces were moved to First Tennessee Park in mid 2015, Greer turned out to be basically surrendered. Vandals peppered the site with spray painting, and a significant number of the structure's windows and box seats were harmed. The playing field ended up congested with brush, and photographs of the arena's inside started showing up on the sites and web-based social networking records of mysterious urban travelers. 

Soon thereafter, Mayor Dean communicated enthusiasm for changing over the office to a network donning complex or another city park, at the same time, nearing the finish of his term, at last conceded the choice to the following city hall leader (Megan Barry, chose 2015). Meanwhile, Metropolitan Director of Parks Tommy Lynch prescribed that the arena be devastated because of the potential expenses for any remodel, including the expulsion of asbestos. The office approached Mayor Barry for $800,000 to support the devastation of the concourse and seating bowl in order to grow the green space at the property which could then be sold to private engineers. 

Proposed utilizes for the land incorporated a soccer arena, an indoor tennis office for Belmont University, open tennis courts, rodeo grounds, a Kroger supermarket, and an area park. In a letter to the manager of "The Tennessean", previous Sounds President Larry Schmittou communicated his enthusiasm for Greer turning into a novice baseball park, refering to its luxuries and a few Metro secondary schools that needed baseball fields of their own. Two open gatherings were held in September 2016 to talk about these and different recommendations and thoughts for the space. 

The city's objective was to make a blended use improvement with green space and moderate lodging. By April 2017, an exceptional board had limited the look for an arrangement and site engineer down to five recommendations. In May 2017, the Barry organization chose a proposition called Cloud Hill by the Nashville-based Mathews Company and supported by music maker T Bone Burnett. The proposed redevelopment of the 21-section of land site included music and workmanship space, a network focus, open park space, and moderate lodging. The impression of the baseball field and outfield would have been transformed into the Great Lawn, a green space pleasing beginner baseball and soccer. Renderings demonstrated the guitar scoreboard and a part of the outfield divider unblemished. The arrangement, which anticipated last endorsement by Metro Parks and the Metro Council, was met with worries by residents and gatherings whom liked to see the property reestablished completely to parkland and the site's Civil War history saved. Different concerns were raised over the absence of straightforwardness in the city's arranging procedure and the privatization of openly possessed land. Cloud Hill's designers dropped their arrangements in January 2018 after archeologists confirmed that undisturbed territories on the edge of the Greer property, however not part of the arena itself, were the plain internment locales of slaves compelled to manufacture Fort Negley. City hall leader Barry communicated her craving that the site respect the historical backdrop of the individuals who kicked the bucket assembling the stronghold. 

Following Barry's renunciation in March 2018, acting Mayor David Briley proposed the obliteration of Greer Stadium, which would reincorporate the site into Fort Negley Park. He has looked for Metro Council endorsement for the roughly $1Â million expected to crush the arena, which would then be seeded over with grass. The Metro Historical Commission has been entrusted with deciding an arrangement to change over the site into one which will respect its Civil War history. The city has looked for a firm to devastate the arena. , Greer is as yet standing, however the city anticipates that destruction should start in mid 2019. 

The Southern League All-Star Game was held twice at Greer Stadium, first in 1979 and again in 1983. The July 12, 1979, challenge set a group of the association's All-Stars against the significant alliance Atlanta Braves. In the third inning, Braves pitcher Preston Hanna was taken profound for a grand slam by Columbus outfielder Danny Heep, and Nashville's Duane Walker included a kept running with his RBI single, scoring Memphis second baseman Tim Raines from third. Up 2â 0, the All-Stars never trailed. The All-Stars proceeded to crush the Braves, 5â 2, preceding a horde of 11,079Â fans. Charlotte pitcher Larry Jones was the triumphant pitcher.

Nashville was additionally spoken to on the All-Star squad by Geoff Combe, Paul Householder, Dave Van Gorder, and supervisor George Scherger who trained the group. 

The middle of the season show came back to Nashville on June 19, 1983. This time, the Sounds were enrolled to fill in as the All-Stars' opposition. Thusly, no Sounds player could be casted a ballot on to All-Star group. In lieu of this, the group perceived all Sounds players as All-Stars. MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn was close by to hurl out the main pitch before a group of people of 1,221 who had held up out about an hour's downpour delay. The All-Stars scored three keeps running in the 6th inning, including a two-run homer by Birmingham's George Foussianes, the diversion's possible MVP. Subsequent to reviving back with two keeps running on Scott Bradley's double RBI single in the eighth, Nashville's Erik Peterson stood out in the ninth with the tying and winning keeps running on base to end the diversion.

Players from each of the three Triple-An alliances (the American Association, Pacific Coast League, and International League) were separated into two groups, American and National, in light of their MLB parent club's connection. Notwithstanding an early American League lead, the Nationals returned to score the triumphant keep running in the fifth inning when Tucson's Brian Hunter got back home on a wild pitch. The Nationals won by a last score of 8â 5. The "Star of Stars", or MVP, for the American Association was Nashville's Ray Durham who had three hits and scored the amusement's initially run. Luis Lopez of the Richmond Braves was the International League's MVP for his three-hit, two-RBI night; Paul Faries, of the Phoenix Firebirds, was the PCL's MVP with one hit and two RBI.

Each hitter being given ten swings each to hit however many homers as could be expected under the circumstances, Coolbaugh and Denson progressed to the finals with two homers each. In the last round, Coolbaugh won the derby by hitting six grand slams in his ten swings. 

Greer facilitated 18 noteworthy group show diversions during the 1990s. Five were rivalries between the Nashville Sounds and their MLB parent clubs, while the other thirteen were spring preparing amusements between significant alliance clubs.
