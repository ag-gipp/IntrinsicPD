"Crush" was composed by Glen Morgan and James Wong and coordinated by Harry Longstreet, with Michael Katleman coordinating extra film. The scene highlighted the first of two visitor appearances by Doug Hutchison as the freak sequential executioner Eugene Victor Tooms, a job he would repeat in "Tooms". "Crush" is the main "beast of-the-week" scene of "The X-Files", an independent plot which is detached to the arrangement's larger folklore. 

The show's fundamental characters are FBI specialists Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who take a shot at cases connected to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is an adherent to the paranormal, while the doubtful Scully has been relegated to expose his work. In this scene, Mulder and Scully research a progression of ceremonial killings by someone apparently fit for pressing his body through outlandishly thin holes. The operators reason that their suspect might be a hereditary freak who has been executing in binges for a long time. 

Generation of "Press" was dangerous; innovative contrasts among Longstreet and the group prompted him being supplanted as executive, while some missing scenes should have been shot after the underlying taping. In light of this choppiness, the consummation of the scene depended on after creation systems. Be that as it may, "Press" has gotten positive surveys from commentators, for the most part concentrating on Hutchison's execution and the reverberation of his character. The scene has thusly been depicted by "The Star" as "the scene that truly sold "The X-Files" thought to the majority". Scholastics have inspected "Crush" for its depiction of the legislative issues of law implementation, featuring the pressureâapparent all through the arrangementâbetween the operators' craving to discover reality and their obligation to verify criminal feelings. 

In Baltimore, businessperson George Usher touches base at his place of business. He is viewed from a tempest channel by somebody who at that point sneaks into the structure by moving through the lift shaft into the ventilation framework, and slaughters Usher by expelling his liver. Usher's homicideâthe most recent of threeâis doled out to careerist FBI specialist Tom Colton (Donal Logue), who swings to Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) for help. Colton is perplexed by the absence of section focuses and the evident expulsion of the livers with exposed hands. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) takes note of their comparability to prior homicide binges from 1933 and 1963. At the scene, he sees a lengthened unique mark broadcasting live vent, which he likewise observes to be like some archived in the X-Files. He infers that since five killings happened amid the before binges, the specialists ought to anticipate two more. 

Since Scully trusts that the executioner will come back to the scenes of his prior wrongdoings, she and Mulder hold up in the parking structure of the place of business. There, they get a man named Eugene Victor Tooms (Doug Hutchison) moving through the air vents. Tooms is given a polygraph test, which incorporates questions composed by Mulder connecting him to murders dating as far back as 1903. Tooms breezes through a large portion of the test, however vitally comes up short Mulder's inquiries putting Tooms at the verifiable homicides. In any case, Colton rejects Mulder's questions and lets Tooms go. To demonstrate his statement to Scully, Mulder carefully stretches and limits Tooms' fingerprints, demonstrating that they coordinate the prints at the wrongdoing scene. Mulder trusts that Tooms can stretch and crush his body through limited spaces. That night, Tooms exhibits this by pressing down a fireplace to guarantee another injured individual. 

Mulder and Scully discover no documentation on Tooms' life. They visit Frank Briggs (Henry Beckman), a previous analyst, who relates his encounters of the examination concerning the 1933 homicides. Briggs brings out old photos of Toomsâwho has not matured in sixty yearsâand gives them the location of Tooms' previous condo building. There, Mulder and Scully discover a "home" built out of paper and bile in the structure's slither space, just as a few trophy things taken from past unfortunate casualties. Mulder suspects that Tooms is a freak who can sleep for a long time at any given moment subsequent to devouring five human livers. As the two leave, Tooms, who is stowing away in the rafters, stealthily takes the neckband Scully is wearing as another trophy. 

Mulder and Scully put the loft under observation, however Colton has them removed the activity. Mulder discovers Scully's jewelry in Tooms' loft and attempts to call his accomplice, however her telephone line has been cut. Tooms breaks into her loft through a little air vent to slaughter her, yet Mulder surges there and catches him first. Tooms is placed in an organization for the criminally crazy where he starts to construct another home utilizing paper. At the establishment, Scully illuminates Mulder that therapeutic tests on Tooms demonstrate a strange skeletal and muscle framework, and a quickly declining digestion. At the point when Tooms is given sustenance through an opening in the entryway, he gazes at the slender space and smiles. 

Coming after two scenes concentrated on the arrangement's "folklore", or anecdotal history, "Crush" set up that the show could cover other paranormal subjects, and was the principal "beast of-the-week" scene of "The X-Files". Arrangement maker Chris Carter felt that the show couldn't support its energy except if it stretched out from the already UFO-focused plots. Co-journalists Glen Morgan and James Wong were propelled to compose the scene when they took a gander at a ventilation shaft outside of their office and pondered whether somebody could creep inside it. In spite of the fact that the scene has parallels with the second "" film, "The Night Strangler" (1973), which included a man who submits kills like clockwork, Morgan and Wong have expressed they were roused by the sequential executioners Jack the Ripper and Richard Ramirez. In the wake of eating foie gras amid an outing to France, Carter proposed the possibility that the scalawag ought to devour human livers. Morgan noticed that the scholars settled on the liver since it was "more entertaining" than some other organ. The plan to have Tooms utilize a home for hibernation originated from Morgan and Wong; they preferred that if the specialists were unfit to get Tooms, he could return following quite a while of lethargy. 

Performing artist Doug Hutchison was 33 when he tried out for the piece of Tooms, however the makers at first thought of him as unreasonably youthful for the job; Glen Morgan felt that Hutchinson "looks twelve years of age". Anyway Hutchison awed the scholars with his capacity to abruptly change into assaulting conduct, which persuaded them to contract him. He related that his depiction of Tooms was motivated by the "stillness" of Anthony Hopkins' acting in "The Silence of the Lambs". 

The scene's setting up outside shots, and those of Tooms' home, were recorded around Hastings Street in Vancouver. When shooting the primary shot of Tooms' eyes shining from a tempest channel, the creation team arrived past the point where it is possible to verify the road for recording, and a close-by development group were incidentally drafted to protect the region. The ventilation framework through which the main unfortunate casualty is assaulted during the evening was intended to be of a multistory vehicle leave. Be that as it may, to maintain a strategic distance from an exorbitant rising activity to recreate evening, an imitation of the essential pieces of the ventilation framework was worked in a lower dimension of the vehicle leave. Outside shots of Scully's condo were likewise recorded in Vancouver, at a similar area utilized in the pilot scene. Be that as it may, this present area's utilization was later suspended attributable to the constrained scope of shots it managed; most turn around edges would demonstrate an extensive vehicle leave over the road. 

Wong was baffled with chief Harry Longstreet, guaranteeing he didn't have regard for the content. Longstreet had neglected to film one of the content's scenes, and had not acquired extra camera inclusion for the scenes which had been recorded. Thus, Wong and another executive, Michael Katleman, re-shot a few scenes for extra inclusion to finish the scene, and recorded the excluded scene and a few additions. Hutchison additionally experienced issues with Longstreet's coordinating; he found the acting directions he was given "absurd". Morgan said that the scene's generation was risky, feeling that "Crush" "was really spared in postproduction". Duchovny additionally discovered issue with Longstreet's course, and couldn't help contradicting the executive's interpretation of how Fox Mulder ought to be depicted. Portraying their diverse sentiments, Duchovny noticed "the executive needed me to be frantic about this frightful sequential executioner. I resembled, 'No, this is an astounding revelation! He's not ethically at fault, since he's hereditarily determined.' I judge nobody". 

For the shot in which Tooms slides through a fireplace, the makers procured a flexible performer who could press through little spaces. They recorded the shot with the camera remaining underneath the flexibility expert. The smokestack, which was "more like a belt than a pipe", was made to look much smaller than it really was. Utilizing PC created symbolism, they had the capacity to deliver and lengthen shots of the flexibility specialist's fingers. Maker R. W. Goodwin trusted that the flexibility expertâreferred to just as "Pepper"â would just have constrained achievement in fitting down the fireplace set and would work generally as a photograph twofold. Be that as it may, he had the capacity to fit altogether inside the fireplace; the creation group just expected to include some audio effects "of bones snapping and splitting". 

The scene in which Tooms enters Scully's house was at first taped in Hutchison's nonappearance. The group shot his passageway later, utilizing a bigger blue screen set. These shots were carefully combined so that Tooms would seem to rise up out of an a lot littler bring forth than was recorded. The impact was kept to a base; Hutchison's recording was not "crushed" to an extreme, as both Carter and special visualizations manager Mat Beck have expressed their conviction that "toning it down would be ideal: only a trace of the powerful is all that is required". 

In spite of the fact that it didn't legitimately affect the progressing storyline of "The X-Files", "Crush" acquainted key topical components with the arrangement. "Crush" has been portrayed as "the scene where Dana Scully should openly pick a side". She had recently stood up to military authorities in "Profound Throat", and has "painstakingly worded" her reports to shield her accomplice Mulder from derision, however an experience with previous associate Tom Colton drives her to straightforwardly pick among Mulder and the legislative issues of careerism. These advancements with Colton "[tether] another string between her vocation and the remainder of the FBI", featuring a feeling of "irritation and disparagement" from her associates, whose mentalities speak to "institutionally adequate" models of the real world. 

This antagonistic vibe proposes that the arrangement's issues are "not epistemological; they are political"â the specialists, Scully specifically, need to adjust a look for "reality" with the need to verify criminal feelings in their cases. This exercise in careful control "between examining to find reality and social occasion proof to help a court case" has been contrasted with the apparent position of the FBI amid the arrangement's residency. The authority had as of now considered itself to be a law implementation organization in charge of hoarding proof to indict criminal cases. There is a dissimilarity between this methodology and open impression of the FBI's job as an association exploring a target and unopinionated truth; this prompted open disappointment "on the grounds that [people] inaccurately trust that a court is intended to find reality". 

"Crush" debuted on the Fox organize on , and was first communicated in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on . The scene's underlying communicate was seen by roughly family units and 11.1 million watchers. "Press" earned a Nielsen rating of 7.2, with a 13 share, implying that generally 7.2 percent of all TV prepared family units, and 13 percent of families sitting in front of the TV, were checked out the scene. 

Glen Morgan was exceptionally satisfied with Hutchison's execution, portraying him as a "secret weapon" and calling his work "remarkable". Morgan proceeded to express "Tooms", another first season scene in which the character returns. The Vince Gilligan-wrote second season scene "Delicate Light" would likewise make reference to the character. Hutchison composed a prequel to "Crush" titled "Dim He Was and Golden-Eyed" and sent it to Carter, yet the content was returned new for legitimate reasons. "Press" has been portrayed as the main scene of "The X-Files" to fan out into ghastliness, which came to be one of the characterizing types of "The X-Files". The plot of "Press" was adjusted as a novel for youthful grown-ups in 1996 by Ellen Steiber. The scene likewise roused "Collapsing Man", a first season scene of the TV arrangement "Haven". 

In a review of the main season in "Stimulation Weekly", "Press" was appraised B+; it was classified "a vital scene", and Hutchison's depiction of Tooms was portrayed as "significantly frightening". Nonetheless, Thomas Sutcliffe of "The Independent" was increasingly basic, scorning the reason as "totally over the top", and mockingly portrayed Mulder's derivation of Tooms' capacities as "obviously another triumph for the deductive strategy". An article in the "Vancouver Sun" recorded "Crush" as a standout amongst the best independent scenes of the show, saying, ""The X-Files" ended up known for its frightening, beast of-the-week scenes, and Squeeze was the one that begun everything", and that, together with "Tooms", it "stays one of the scariest things at any point seen on TV". Connie Ogle from PopMatters recorded Tooms among the best beasts of the arrangement. 

Keith Phipps, composing for "The A.V. Club", commended the scene, appraised it an Aâ, and depicted Hutchison's job as "the part that would dispatch [him] as a go-to character performing artist for downer parts". Phipps felt the climactic scene in which Tooms invades Scully's house is "the scene that makes the scene", taking note of that there was "a genuine feeling of risk" notwithstanding it being certain that Scully, a lead character, was not going to come to hurt. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Needing to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium and The Lone Gunmen", note that the scene's reason is the first in the arrangement "not to depend upon acknowledged urban legends". It passes on its "silly" plot through proposal, leaving any enhancements groupings of Tooms' capacities until the crowd is "as of now appropriately changed in accordance with the ridiculousness". Be that as it may, Shearman and Pearson found the monolog comparing the wrongdoings submitted by Tooms to the Holocaust, given by the resigned criminologist Briggs, to be "pointless as well as boring to boot". They evaluated the scene four stars out of five. Mumtaj Begum, composing for Malaysia's "The Star", portrayed "Crush" as "the scene that truly sold "The X-Files" thought to the majority", and called it "just splendid". 

The character of Eugene Tooms has additionally pulled in positive analysis. In a visitor section for "Stimulation Weekly"s 1000th issue, creator Neil Gaiman recorded Tooms as one of his most loved beasts, while UGO Networks recorded the character in a commencement of the "Best TV Serial Killers", and depicted Hutchison's going about as "uber-unpleasant". IGN's Christine Seghers recorded Hutchison as the fourth-best visitor star of the arrangement in a best ten commencement, complimented his "splendidly unreasonable" execution, and expressed: "Notwithstanding when he doesn't seem, by all accounts, to be doing anything, Hutchinson [sic] can in any case make your skin creep with his dead, shark-like gaze".
