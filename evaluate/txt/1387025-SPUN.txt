The diversion was created by Cyan Worlds, distributed by Ubisoft, and discharged for Macintosh and Windows PC stages on September 20, 2005. As in past recreations in the arrangement, "End of Ages"s interactivity comprises of exploring universes known as "Ages" by means of the utilization of unique books and things which go about as entryways. On each Age, the player illuminates riddles and finds story pieces of information covered up in the Ages or recorded in journals and diaries.

In a takeoff from past titles in the "Myst" arrangement, "End of Ages" replaces pre-rendered conditions with universes rendered continuously 3D illustrations, enabling players to openly explore the Ages. The essences of performers were carefully mapped onto three-dimensional character models to save authenticity. Cyan focused on making the amusement progressively open to new players by the expansion of numerous techniques for route and an in-diversion camera. "Myst" maker Rand Miller chose to enable players to choose the destinies of the amusement's characters as a blessing to "Myst" fans. 

"End of Ages" was emphatically gotten upon discharge. In spite of objections, for example, reduced intelligence contrasted with past amusements and less fortunate illustrations, productions including "Macworld", "PC Gaming World", and "The Washington Post" made a decision about the diversion a fitting end to the arrangement. After "End of Ages"s discharge, Cyan unexpectedly declared the finish of programming advancement and the cutback of the majority of its staff, however had the capacity to rehire a significant part of the improvement group half a month later. Counting "End of Ages"s deals, the "Myst" establishment had sold in excess of 12 million duplicates by November 2007. 

"Myst V: End of Ages" is an undertaking amusement occurring in the primary individual. Players traverse a few universes known as "Ages", illuminating riddles and assembling story pieces of information by perusing books or watching the 

condition. "End of Ages" offers players three route modes to investigate. The principal, "Exemplary mode", utilizes similar controls utilized in "Myst" and "Riven"; Ages are separated into areas of intrigue, or hubs, and the player's view is fixed at each hub. Players advance to different hubs by tapping on bits of the screen. The "Great Plus" mode utilizes the control plan of "" and ""; development is still hub based however players can turn their view 360 degrees toward any path. The last route mode, known as "Free Look" or "Propelled" mode, enables players to explore and watch the Ages openly like "". The WASD console keys are utilized for strolling forward, in reverse, and sideways, while the mouse changes the player's perspective. 

Another amusement specialist to the arrangement is the utilization of a slate found on every one of the Ages. These slates can be cut utilizing the mouse to make shapes and images. The utilization of the slate is important to speak with a shadowy race of animals known as the Bahro. The Bahro comprehend certain images drawn on the slate and will react to them; the animals additionally recover the slate and return it to its unique space if the player drops it. Slate images can cause ecological changes, for example, downpour or expanded breeze, which might be essential for comprehending astounds. The slate can't be conveyed wherever because of its size. For instance, the player should abandon the slate in the event that they need to climb a stepping stool. 

"End of Ages" has a few highlights intended to enable players to finish confuses. To review pieces of information or vital things, players can utilize a camera highlight to take screen captures, which are then set in a diary the player can access whenever. Player connections with different characters are correspondingly reviewed by means of another diary; everything a character tells the player is put away and can be seen whenever. Diary pages are described by the voice of the character, and missing pages of the diary seem translucent in menus. 

"End of Ages" happens in the present day, at some point after the occasions of "", and starts as the player reacts to a letter from Atrus. Atrus is an author of uncommon volumes called connecting books, which fill in as gateways or connections to universes known as Ages. A connecting book to the Age of Myst, the setting of the first amusement, lies fixed in the vestiges of the old D'ni progress. The D'ni had the capacity to make connecting books, yet their general public disintegrated from inside; Atrus and his family have been attempting to reestablish the D'ni individuals and made an Age for the survivors to live on, known as Releeshahn (presented "Estranged abroad"). Atrus by this period is an elderly person, grieving the passings of his children Sirrus and Achenar in "Disclosure", and the demise of his better half Catherine in the period after. In his letter, Atrus communicates worry that his little girl, Yeesha, might be lost too. 

The player begins in Atrus' old examination on K'veer, an island close to the remnants of the primary D'ni city; in the waiting room outside the investigation, there is a bizarre tablet secured on a special raised area. Yeesha connects in and clarifies that legends express that so as to completely reestablish D'ni, somebody known as the Grower must use the tablet. The ancient rarity can completely control a strange oppressed race known as the Bahro. As Yeesha settled on the wrong choice after opening the tablet, she can never again use it; Yeesha rather accuses the player of revealing the tablet's capacity. Subsequent to leaving Yeesha, the player meets a man named Esher close to "the Great Shaft", associating D'ni to the surface (as point by point in ""). Esher is an overcomer of the fall of D'ni and tells the player that Yeesha can't be trusted, cautioning the player not to give her the Tablet. All through the Great Shaft, the player gathers twelve parts of Yeesha's diary. The compositions seem to affirm Esher's admonitions, as the portrayal apparently shows that Yeesha has plunged into frenzy, trusting herself to be the Grower. 

At the asking of both Yeesha and Esher, the player traversed four Ages, gathering four slates that open the tablet's capacity. Esher once in a while shows up in the Ages to offer his advice, or uncover the accounts of his kin and the universes the player investigates. When every one of the four slates are gathered, Esher demands that the player get the tablet to him the now-opened Age of Myst. The player is then come back to K'veer, where they have four conceivable options. Making a trip to Myst without the tablet will cause Esher to indignantly surrender the player with no chance to get out. In the event that Esher is given the tablet, he will disclose he wishes to utilize the tablet for mastery, and will likewise leave the player caught. On the off chance that the player gives the tablet to Yeesha, the tablet basically sneaks past her hands and vanishes into the ground; she leaves, frustrated, leaving the player caught in D'ni. The main great closure includes giving the Bahro the tablet, finishing their oppression. Landing at Releeshahn, the new home Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and discuss another part for the D'ni individuals; Esher is given over to the Bahro to be rebuffed for his violations. The diversion finishes on a visit to Releeshahn. 

Robyn and Rand Miller, "Myst"s makers, had at first ruled against making spin-offs of 1997's "Riven". Nonetheless, the distributing rights to the arrangement later exchanged to Ubisoft, who charged two spin-offs: "" and "". "Myst V: End of Ages" was formally reported at the 2005 MacWorld Expo by "Myst" and "Riven"s engineer, Cyan Worlds. In the declaration, Cyan expressed that the diversion would be the last portion in the arrangement. 

While most past "Myst" titles had sworn off 3D designs rendered progressively for intuitive prerendered conditions, Rand Miller chose that innovation had progressed to the point that "Finish of Ages" could utilize ongoing illustrations without yielding player inundation. "Throughout the years the "Myst" recreations have turned out to be progressively modern, coming full circle in "Myst V", where we offer striking designs that players can walk easily through," Miller expressed in a meeting. Mill operator underlined that the objective of the amusement stayed for players to move toward becoming inundated in "Myst"s exchange universes. 

A concentration being developed was to make "End of Ages" more available than past "Myst" diversions, which had regularly frustrated uninitiated players with their riddles. Gaining from the control conspire utilized in another continuous "Myst" diversion (a revamp of the first entitled "realMyst"), Cyan chose to build up various control techniques to enable new players to rapidly get familiar with the controls, just as give a commonplace interface to establishment veterans. Esher's encounters with the player's journey enabled an insight framework to be incorporated with the story. Mill operator needed to roll out a huge improvement from past recreations in the arrangement, in that the player's activities choose the destiny of the characters. At the point when gotten some information about the consummation, Miller clarified, "The eventual fate of human advancement is down to this point, and the decisions you make figure out where it goes." 

"Myst" recreations had normally utilized chroma key to embed film of on-screen characters into computerized foundations. The models of "End of Ages"s characters were rather PC produced, however Cyan did not have any desire to lose the glow and feeling given by utilizing a live on-screen character. Rather Cyan built up a gadget mounted to the performers' faces that caught video of the on-screen characters while they talked their lines. The video was then controlled and utilized as a facial surface that was mapped onto the 3D characters, and the facial development was likewise followed and used to vitalize the essences of the characters in-diversion. Movement catch of the body was additionally used to guarantee exact development. Cyan staff were stressed that the sound syncing for movement would not be done in time for the E3 divulging of the amusement, however were content with the final products. Basic response to amusement sneak peaks and impressions at E3 was exceptionally positive. Mill operator was alleviated, expressing that when the generally shooter amusement overwhelmed exhibit announced that "Finish of Ages" may be the best diversion in the arrangement, "That feels better". 

Arranger Tim Larkin, a sound creator and sound executive at Cyan who had recently chipped away at "realMyst" and "", was given the assignment of creating "Myst V"s melodic score. Larkin expressed that while before "Myst" amusements had been compelled by innovative confinements, the accessible innovation permitted "End of Ages" to have a progressively powerful condition, with the music changing with different timings of various audio cues. Encompass sound gave an increasingly reasonable and vivid interactivity experience. A noteworthy test recorded as a hard copy the music was that the score must be sufficiently adaptable to coordinate the non-direct interactivity occasions. "Amusements are absolutely intelligent encounters," Larkin clarified. "You don't direct a player through, since you can't rely on being at a specific spot at a specific time. I can't compose signal music to get the player to do this, this and after that this. One player may hear the prompt and run the other way!" Larkin needed to step far from what he had realized as a jazz author and performer composing pieces with a clear start and end, rather making music with "less circular segment" and structure. Larkin conceded that some "Myst" fans would have favored a melodic style like Robyn Miller's scores for "Myst" and "Riven", however answered by saying that change occurs and players would discover something to like in the new music on the off chance that they kept a receptive outlook. 

Because of a tight spending plan, Larkin was unfit to contract a symphony to play out the music; every one of the instruments in the soundtrack beside Larkin's own trumpet playing are examined instruments. Larkin utilized an assortment of synthesizers, samplers, and PCs to make the score, working at his home studio and Cyan's workplaces. Larkin found that the greatest test with the score was completing it on schedule for the diversion to deliver. The soundtrack was discharged in CD position on October 25, 2005. 

Cyan Worlds is never again utilizing Havok (on the grounds that Havok does not have a Mac-perfect library, the motivation behind why couldn't be ported to the Mac) yet is rather utilizing an open-source cross-stage material science library called Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) to guarantee Mac and PC similarity. 

"End of Ages" was bundled in two diverse retail forms for discharge in September 2005, to match with the twelfth commemoration of the establishment's presentation. A standard version, containing just the amusement, was discharged for Windows-based PCs in a CD-ROM position. The constrained version contained the first soundtrack, a gatherer's lithograph, system manage, and a reward DVD with a "creation of" review on the "Myst" establishment. The video was made by GameTap, an auxiliary of Turner Broadcasting System; the in the background include was the main amusement related narrative created by Turner. The restricted version was dispatched on cross breed Mac OS X/Windows DVDs, with Macintosh transformation given by Quebec-based designer Beenox; this was the main business choice for Macintosh players. 

In no time before "End of Ages" was discharged, Cyan reported the cutback of the majority of the staff and that the organization would stop programming advancement. The explanation behind the unexpected conclusion was an inability to increase monetary sponsorship for another venture after "End of Ages"s advancement. Some portion of the fault for the organization's budgetary inconveniences were set on the business dissatisfaction of "". The organization was, as indicated by Rand Miller, "ready to haul a rabbit out of a cap" and rehire "practically every one of" the representatives half a month later in the wake of sponsorship for another venture was verified. With the arrival of "End of Ages", Cyan expressed that their next diversion would have nothing to do with the "Myst" arrangement. While pitching an anonymous web based amusement to distributers, Cyan created "" with online substance webpage Fanista. 

In general, "End of Ages" was generally welcomed by faultfinders. The amusement was made a decision about a fitting end to the arrangement, and in mix with different diversions in the arrangement sold in excess of 12 million duplicates by November 2007. It set 6th for the seven day stretch of October 9 on NPD Techworld's business rankings. 

Similarly as with past amusements, the visuals of "End of Ages" were broadly adulated. The change to continuous rendering was commonly observed as a positive advance. The amusement's music was commended; GameSpot's audit noticed the utilization of music in "End of Ages" was inadequate, yet the little sound present set the best possible tone for various Ages. A couple of analysts, for example, Charles Herold of the "New York Times", felt that the illustrations missed the mark concerning what was conceivable, particularly contrasted with the prerendered visuals of "Myst IV: Revelation". While Greg Kasavin of GameSpot felt that however the visuals were keeping pace with past diversions, "End of Ages" was feeling the loss of a few components which made "Myst IV" increasingly vivid; just imperative, story-driving things could be interfaced with, for instance, and the player makes no sounds or strides in the amusement. 

The characters of "Myst", at times criticized in past amusements, were generally welcomed in "End of Ages". Productions, for example, GameSpot and IGN applauded the voice acting and the change to character models; Jaun Castro of IGN expressed that however the player couldn't collaborate legitimately with the characters, the rendered characters ended up "feeling progressively certifiable and genuine" than in past diversions, talking with real conviction and activity. Unique recognition was given to David Ogden Stiers for breathing life into Esher. A disagreeing assessment was displayed by analyst Mark Saltzman, who imagined that players may end up exhausted by the "excessively emotional" character exchange. 

Commentators energetically got the expansion of the slate and its related riddles. Oliver Clare of Eurogamer considered the slate framework an appreciated expansion to the "Myst" equation, in spite of the fact that he felt that the acknowledgment of images was at times excessively exact. Paul Presley of "PC and Video Games" felt that the slate idea could have been investigated further, while GameSpot delighted in the natural impacts made by the slates. "End of Ages" won a few honors upon discharge, including IGN's "manager's decision". Larkin's music was selected under the "Best Interactive Score" classification at the 2006 Game Audio Network Guild Awards, and won the 2006 Game Industry News grant for best soundtrack. It was a chosen one for GameSpot's 2005 "Best Adventure Game" grant and IGN's prize for the year's top PC experience diversion, however lost the two classifications to "Fahrenheit".
