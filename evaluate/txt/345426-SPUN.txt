The components of the banner signify a youthful country on the ascendant, widespread fraternity and balance, and national goals. 

Vessels adrift don't utilize the national banner as an ensign. Trader vessels and joy make fly a common ensign of red accused in white of a variation of the bow and stars symbol in the middle.

As per a record given by Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese populace needed five stars, which were displayed off the banner of the People's Republic of China and the Muslim populace needed a bow moon. Both of these images were joined to make the national banner of Singapore. 

On 30 November 1959, the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 was passed to control the utilization and show of the State Arms and State Flag and the execution of the National Anthem.
