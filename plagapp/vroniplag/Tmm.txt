Abstract
Spreading depression (SD) is believed to be a putative neuronal mechanism underlying
different neurological disorders such as migraine aura and subsequent pain. In vitro
combined neocortex-hippocampus brain slice techniques were used to investigate the
propagation pattern of repetitive SD between the neocortex and the hippocampus.
Different substances as well as continuous electrical stimulations and induction of longterm potentiation (LTP) in the entorhinal cortex were used. Induction of repetitive SD
by KCl injection in somatosensory cortex enhanced the probability of SD entrance to
the hippocampus via the entorhinal cortex. Application of AMPA receptor blocker
CNQX, cannabinoide receptor agonist WIN 55212-2, and potassium ion blocker 4-AP
facilitated the propagation of SD to the hippocampus, whereas application of NMDA
blocker APV and GABAA blocker bicuculline inhibited SD from penetration to the
hippocampus. Both continuous repetitive electrical stimulations and LTP facilitated the
propagation of SD entrance to the hippocampus after 90 minutes. Administration of
both NMDA blocker APV and AMPA receptor blocker CNQX 30 minutes before LTP
blocked the facilitatory effect of LTP on SD propagation to the hippocampus. These
data indicate the importance of the entorhinal cortex in filtering the signals between the
neocortex and the hippocampus. The filtering effect of entorhinal cortex effect could be
manipulated by different drugs and electrical stimulations. This may be important to
understanding of SD propagation in the neurological disorders and help to design the
new therapeutic strategies.

Introduction
Spreading depression (SD) is a pathophysiological phenomenon which exhibits as a
propagating wave of neuronal and glial hyperexcitability of few seconds followed by a
transient wave of depression of few minutes and later subsides with another longduration hyperexcitability, first identified in the cerebral cortex of rabbits (Leao, 1944;
Somjen, 2001; Gorji, 2001). The SD phenomenon is exclusive to the central nervous
system and influences both the neuronal and the glial cells in different parts of the
central nervous system including both brain and spinal cord.
SD propagated in all neuronal tissues in both vertical and horizontal directions. SD
probably starts with a cellular efflux of K+, leading to depolarization and a period of
relative electrical silence. The subsequent energy-dependent restitution of ion gradients
eventually restores normal neuronal activities. The ionic activity, however, results in a
wave of neuronal depolarization propagating away from the elicitation site at a velocity
of 2-5 mm/min. Because the depolarization-restoration process takes 1.5 min, the wave
is only ~5mm deep (Smith et al., 2006). Different cortical layers are differently
penetrated by SD waves. However, it should be noted that SD propagates easier in
horizontal direction and can easily spreads for few centimetres.
SD involves a temporary localized redistribution of different ions between intracellular
and extracellular spaces. This ion redistribution is energy dependent. During eliciting of
SD the concentration of extracellular K+ ([K+]o), rapidly rises (up to 60mM), causing
brief neuronal excitation then depolarization and a period of electrical silence during
which DC potential at the brain surface falls. In tandem, extracellular sodium ([Na+]o)
and chloride ([Cl−]o) levels decrease as these ions enter cells. Consequently, water
enters cells, the extracellular space is reduced, and cells swell. Ca2+ ions also move
inwards, but slightly later than the outward movement of K+, suggesting that Ca2+
movements follow K+ fluxes. Additional negative ion species move outwards to
maintain electrical balance, the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate probably being
the most crucial (Nicholson and Sykova, 1998; Somjen et al., 2001).

figure of SD discovery), Alterations of electrical activities recorded from a rabbit
during propagation of spreading depression (SD). Traces reveal propagation of
flattening of epileptiform burst potentials elicited by spreading of cortical SD as well
as gradual propagating recovery of these activities.
SD can be initiated by different stimuli and so can be directly studied in various in vivo
and in vitro experimental animal models. It was first induced by applying a brief tetanus
of faradic stimulation to the rabbit neocortex (Leao, 1944; Bures et al., 1974; Fig. 1).
However, such stimuli could lead to convulsive activity spreading from the stimulated
area and so other investigators employed direct current (DC) stimuli (Leao & Morrison,
1945; Ochs, 1962). Mechanical stimulation, for example, by stroking of the cortical
surface with a blunt instrument, a falling weight or even lightly tapping the cortex also
initiates SD (Lea˜o, 1944; Zachar and Zacharova´, 1963). More recent studies have
achieved more reliable and reproducible induction of SD by rapidly inserting and
retracting hypodermic steel needles (Kaube and Goadsby, 1994; Lambert et al., 1999;
Ebersberger et al., 2001). However, one of the most common models of SD initiation is
KCl application to the neuronal tissues (Wernsmann et al., 2006; Dehbandi et al., 2008).
This model has been proven to be the most reliable stimulus leading to reproducible
events on earlier occasions in both non-imaging and imaging studies (Martins-Ferreira
3

et al., 2000; Bradley et al., 2001). Changes in extracellular K+ concentration themselves
might be involved in such pathophysiological processes in human brain tissue
(Mayevsky et al., 1996; Nicholson & Sykova, 1998).
Other methods of SD induction are including: (1) application of the Na+-K+ ATP-ase
inhibitor ouabain; (2) applications of the excitatory amino acids glutamate and
aspartate; (3) administration of metabolic inhibitors such as NaCN and NaN that poison
oxidative metabolism and NaF and iodoacetate that primarily interfere with glycolysis;
(4) local cooling may initiate SD by depressing energy metabolism below a critical level
but has proven an irreproducible experimental method. Furthermore, cooling itself
raises the threshold for electrically or mechanically induced SD; (5) there are isolated
reports of high-frequency electrical stimulation combined with the administration of
pharmacological agents producing SD (Smith et al., 2006).
Both volume-activated ion channels and glial cells probably play important roles in the
restoration of normal cellular homeostasis. The former are stimulated during cell
swelling, and the latter provide spatial buffering that prevents increased levels of [K+]o
and [Glu−]o during normal neuronal activity. However, they might also prolong SD:
volume-activated ion channels release glutamate during SD; and although gliotoxins
prolong SD, they also reduce glutamate efflux from glial cells. SD appears more
difficult to evoke in brains of larger animals in which the ratio of glia to neurones tends
to be higher, suggesting that glial cells are important for limiting SD activity. Such
limiting forces might be greater in the more complexly folded human brain, and could
explain the paucity of literature accounts of SD during neurosurgery.
SD and neurological disorders
Processes similar to SD phenomenon in animal cortex are thought to occur in different
neurological disorders in humans. These conditions are migraine with aura, brain
trauma, ischemia/infarction, brain haemorrhage, epilepsy, and transient global amnesia
(Gorji, 2001). Direct modulation of electrical activity of cortical neurons by the locally
4

spreading wave can lead to neurological symptoms (e.g. the aura phase of migraine).
These same neuronal processes can also alter the neurochemistry of cortical and subcortical structures, modulating oxygen distribution and cell survival in these structures
and change the behaviour. These problem has not been addressed before, mainly
because SD induces such a short depression in each cortical loci, that transient
neurochemical changes cannot be examined with conventional approaches, for example
by microdialysis.
A) SD and migraine with aura: A few years before discovery of SD, Lashley (1941)
explained his visual aura associated with his own ophthalmic migraine attacks as
bright scintillations moving across the visual field leaving a blind area in his
visual field. Mapping the trajectory of his scotoma across his visual field gave a
predicted velocity over a retinotopically organised visual cortex of
approximately 2-3 mm/min (Lashley, 1941; Milner, 1958). This report
accordingly suggested a possible physiological mechanism for migraine aura in
the visual cortex. Thus, it may be suggested that the scintillations represent the
excitatory phase, while the pursuing blind spot is the inhibitory process of a SD
wave. Similar conclusions were suggested from blood flow studies (Lauritzen,
1984) that demonstrated that the oligaemia associated with the spread of SD
from the occipital cortex showed a very similar propagation velocity to that of
the SD itself. A recent study strongly supports the link between SD and the aura
period in human visual cortex. High-field functional magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) was used to detect blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
changes during visual aura in three migraineurs. A focal increase in BOLD
signals developed first in extrastriate cortex and spread at the velocity closed to
SD propagation velocity (3.5 ± 1.1 mm/min) over occipital cortex. These initial
BOLD features were consistent with scintillations and paralleled by decreases in
the stimulus-driven MR oscillations. Increasing in BOLD signals was followed
by a decrease in the mean MR signal. This phase appeared to correspond to the
localized scotoma and MR stimulus-induced response remained suppressed.
Within about fifteen minutes, both BOLD signals and MR stimulus-induced
5

response recovered. During periods with no visual stimulation, but while the
subject was experiencing scintillations, BOLD signal followed the retinotopic
progression of the visual percept. Spreading BOLD signal changes as CSD did
not cross prominent sulci (Hadjikhani et al., 2001). In line with these data,
magnetoencephalographic studies in human revealed that the magnetic signals
were seen in migraine patients but not in patients suffering from other forms of
headache or normal controls. Three distinctive signal patterns; suppression of
spontaneous cortical activity, slow field changes and large-amplitude waves,
were observed strictly in migraine patients. In some patients with migraine,
magnetic signals were also recorded between attacks. The same magnetic fields
appeared during the propagation of SD in the cortex of anesthetized animals
(Welch et al, 1993). The most common symptoms during the aura phase in
migraine are visual. As mentioned, spreading oligemia and excitation wave of
aura symptoms start in occipital lobe and propagates anteriorly. Altering the
ionic makeup of the extracellular fluid reversibly raises or lowers the
susceptibility to SD. Glial cells act as spatial buffer especially for potassium by
taking potassium up and carrying it from regions of high concentration to
neighbouring areas of low concentration. Regarding anatomical studies in
human, the lowest glial–neuronal ratio is in the primary visual cortex (Fig. 2;
Gorji, 2001).

B) SD and cerebrovascular diseases: SD was observed in patients suffering from
brain ischemia/infarction, brain haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage.
The damage to cerebral tissue depends on a complex series of physiological
responses and degenerative cellular cascades involving a dynamic interplay
among the various cells in the region of damaged tissue. Experimental studies of
focal ischemic stroke in animals and human support the concept that there is a
core of severe ischemia, the ‘ischemic core’ which is surrounded by a region of
7

reduced perfusion, the ‘ischemic penumbra’. Within the ischemic core, failure of
oxygen and glucose delivery leads to rapid depletion of energy stores and cell
death. Central to the hypothesis of neuronal salvage is the concept of the
ischemic penumbra. The penumbra is an area which metabolic capacity is
suppressed but destruction is not yet inevitable (Olesen et al., 1986). The
etiology of progressive cell injury and death in the penumbra zone has been
clarified in some extent. Evidence suggests that SD plays a role in the ischemia–
infarction tissue damage process. Excitotoxicity results from excessive release
and impaired uptake of excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. It is hypothesized
that excessive amount of glutamate increases intracellular calcium preferentially
via NMDA-receptor-mediated channels. A profound increase in extracellular
potassium occurs in the ischemic core. There is a suggestion that the high
potassium concentration in the ischemic focus initiates diffusion of K+ into the
adjacent normally superfused cortex and triggers SD-like deflections
propagating from the rim of the focus to the surrounding intact tissue during the
early stages of focal ischemia (Nedergaard et al., 1986). Local reduction of
tissue glucose content, caused by the increased demands and reduced supply of
glucose in the area, might further reduce the threshold for elicitation of SD. In
subsequent minutes and hours, further SD waves can be generated from the
boundary of the focus provided that the chemical gradient is strong enough to
support sufficiently intensive diffusion of active substances into the intact
neocortex (Hossmann, 1996). A SD wave elicited from a single point at the
periphery of the focus spreads away from it but may turn around and enter the
penumbra zone in a different area of the focus. Generation of SD is limited to an
approximately 120 minutes period after ischemia, followed by a shorter interval
of increased SD susceptibility which disappear 3–4 h after the onset of focal
ischemia (Koroleva et al., 1998). Such SD events are significantly longer than
those occurring in normoxic neocortex and can be potentially harmful because
they are accompanied by additional release of glutamate and influx of calcium
into the neurons. In normal brain tissue, repeated SD waves do not induce any
morphological or metabolic damage. However, it is believed that when SD
8

repeatedly collapses ionic gradients, activation of NMDA receptors and gap
junctions propagates SD and triggers a massive Ca2+ influx, which in energycompromised neurons is enough to initiate a cell death cascade (Somjen et al.,
1990). The tissue fully recovers when SD induced by elevating K+ in rat
hippocampal slices, but in slices that are metabolically compromised by oxygen/
glucose deprivation, cellular damage develops only where SD has propagated.
After propagating of SD in oxygen/glucose-deprived (ischemic) tissues, the
evoked CA1 field potential is permanently lost, the cell bodies of involved
neurons swell and their dendritic areas increase in opacity (Obeidat and Andrew,
1998).
C) SD and epilepsy: SD is a well-known phenomenon in experimental epilepsy. SD
has been observed in a variety of in vitro and in vivo epilepsy models in
different animal species. Reduction of extracellular Mg2+ concentrations,
blocking of K+ channels, e.g., by 4-aminopyridine, activation of NMDA
receptors, increased extracellular K+, blocking of Na+–K+ ATPase, e.g., by
ouabain, blocking of T-type Ca2+ channels, e.g., by NiCl2, blocking of GABA
receptors, e.g., by picrotoxin, are the common pathways for initiation of both
epileptiform burst discharges and SD in experimental animal models (Gorji,
2001). By all abovementioned mechanisms, SD appears spontaneously between
epileptiform ictal events. SD can be elicited in susceptible area by a single
discharge of an epileptic focus (spike triggered SD). Epileptiform field
potentials usually suppress during SD occurrence and reappear in few minutes
(Koroleva and

Bures, 1982). Penetration of cortical SD into epileptic foci

established in different models of epilepsy. However, it should be noted that SD
does not enter electrically or pharmacologically elicited foci of epileptic activity
with high rates of interictal discharges which resulted in anomalous SD
propagation. This abnormal SD conduction may account for periodic changes of
ictal and interictal activity found in some types of focal epilepsy (Koroleva and
Bures, 1982). SD was observed in association with epilepsy in patients suffering
from brain vascular disorders (Fabricius et al., 2008). Regional cerebral blood
flow (rCBF) changes in epilepsy have some similarities to those changes in
9

migraine. The human brain frequently has been observed during convulsive
seizure. An initial pallor preceding and during the early phase of epileptic attack
was reported while the latter part of the fit and post-convulsive state were
accompanied by widespread vasodilatation of cerebral vessels. The dilated
vessels were first cyanotic, and then for several hours bright red. Positron
emission tomography shows a significant reduction of rCBF and oxygen
consumption in interictal period and an increased local blood flow in the ictal
state in epileptic focus. A small but significant reduction in both of those was
observed in cerebral hemisphere homolateral to the hypoperfused and
hypometabolic areas (Bernardi et al., 1983). Ictal scans revealed a focal or
multifocal increase in rCBF and oxygen consumption in an active seizure focus
(Olesen, 1986).
SD can serve as a marker of normal function of SD-prone cerebral tissue. It disappears
in cortical regions in which neuronal density was reduced by ischemia and can be used
for appreciation of delayed recovery or deterioration in the penumbra zone after focal
ischemia. Several studies showed that in focal brain ischemia SD increases the ischemic
volume. The pathogenic importance of peri-infarct depolarisations for the progression
of ischemic injury is supported by the close linear correlation between number of SD
and the duration of elevated potassium with infarct volume and reduction of infarct size
and neuronal loss in penumbra area by application of NMDA and non-NMDA receptor
antagonist and by hypothermia (Mies et al., 1993; Mies et al., 1994).
Propagation of SD
No explanation of the propagation of SD has been suggested that accounts for all the
facts presently proven. The hypothesis that gained wide acceptance is that the spread of
SD probably involves the release and diffusion of the chemical mediators, most likely
K+ and glutamate into the interstitial fluid. In the isolated chick retina, human
neocortical tissue and cat brain, NMDA receptor antagonists block SD completely. By
contrast, in rat hippocampus, glutamate and Ca2+ facilitate SD initiation, whereas
NMDA antagonists and low Ca2+]o delay its onset but fail to block SD completely.
10

Given the widespread potential signalling capacities of Ca2+ waves, observations of the
interactions between astrocytes and neurons in cell culture have suggested that Ca2+
waves play a role in SD initiation and propagation.
Widely accepted hypotheses hold that the primary event responsible for both the
initiation and the propagation of SD is the release of some substance from neuronal
elements to the extracellular compartment, which initially excites and then depresses
adjacent neurons. The slowness of diffusion of the mediator would account for the low
velocity of SD propagation. Among the substances proposed to mediate SD propagation
are potassium (Grafstein, 1963; Bures et al., 1974) and excitatory amino acids
(Fabricius et al., 1993). There are, however, observations that are difficult to reconcile
with either of these two propositions.
SD had been interpreted as a composite process or a sequence of several linked events.
To solve its genesis, a most important question concerns identification of the very first
step in the chain reaction. In the extant literature, however, generally more attention has
been given to the major depolarization and the attending extracellular potential shift
than to the antecedent events. Among antecedents heralding the onset of SD that have
been reported, are a slight increase of extracellular potassium, a small positive shift
preceding the fast negative shift of the extracellular potential and several types of fast
field activity including a short burst of action potentials or intense synaptic noise (Leao,
1944; Higashida et al., 1974). Even a silence of spontaneous or evoked activity has
occasionally been described prior to other signs (Higashida et al., 1974). Not all of these
early signs are obligatory prodromals of the large, accelerating, regenerative
depolarization that is typical of the process.
Even though the discharge of impulses is not required for the initiation or the
propagation of SD, the impulse shower does regularly appear at its beginning. The
mechanism that gives rise to the impulse discharge may well have a key role in the
evolution of SD. The widely spread synchronization seems best explained by electrical
continuity that could be provided by gap junctions. Effective communication by way of
quasi-syncytial nets has been demonstrated in other systems, for example in the spread
11

of so-called calcium waves in cell cultures (Cornell- Bell et al., 1990). Patent gap
junctions may provide a path not only for electric current and for ions but also for
intracellular “second” messengers and other active ingredients in cytosol. SD has
frequently been interpreted as a diffusion-reaction process whose velocity of spread is
governed by the rate of the reaction, which could involve the release of some substance
from cells that then acted on the cell membrane of adjacent cells. As there are reasons
for doubting a decisive role of either K or of glutamate, we are proposing an alternative
hypothesis, involving the exchange of chemical signals not through the interstitial space
but by way of gap junctions. The autocatalytic reaction so initiated would alter the
membrane from the inside, instead of acting on receptors on the outside.
Cortical structures are organized to process information in a parallel manner via
excitatory and inhibitory interactions within and between adjacent cortical modules
(Mountcastle, 1997). Throughout the CNS, local circuit inhibition plays an integral role
in both neuronal network processing and the regulation of the excitability of projection
neurons. Inhibitory circuits may be particularly important to signal processing in
cortical networks with pronounced recurrent excitatory interactions (Wong et al., 1984).
This inhibition may limit the propagation of excitation and facilitate discharge
synchronization of projection neurons by inducing a synchronous refractory period.
Breakdown in the dynamic balance of inhibitory and excitatory interaction can lead to a
functional disconnection (Wong and Prince, 1990) and disrupts the normal spread of
lateral excitation (Grunze et al., 1996).
The hippocampus has direct and important functional interactions with brain areas
likely to be important to migraine, such as the areas associated with vision, emotions
and neuroendocrine homeostasis. The connection between entorhinal cortex and
hippocampus is regarded as an important loop responsible for the processing of sensory
information (Vaisanen et al., 1999). Thus, these medial temporal lobe structures may
play a crucial role in the development of somatosensory and neuropsychotic symptoms
in neurological disorders such as epilepsy and migraine (Eid et al. 1995). As memories
in humans depend initially on the medial temporal lobe system, including the
12

hippocampus, it was suggested that interictal memory dysfunction in patients with
migraine might be attributed to the hippocampus involvement (Kupfermann, 1966).
Furthermore, propagation of SD in the hippocampus was believed to play a role in
migraine pain by triggering nociceptive activation of the caudal trigeminal nucleus
(Kunkler and Kraig, 2003). Classical studies investigated hippocampal SD more often
by implantation of KCl into the hippocampus and induction of SD directly in the tissue.
Little information is available on the effects of cortical SD on hippocampal activity.
Because altered neural circuit function can be seen remote from the SD propagation site,
using in vitro brain models, the effects of different substances as well as electrical
stimulation on propagation of SD between the neocortex and the hippocampus was
investigated.

Material and methods
Adult rats (250–300 g) were decapitated under deep methohexital anaesthesia and the
brains were rapidly removed to ice-cold (4 °C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF).
The cerebellum was removed and a cut was made to divide the two cerebral
hemispheres. Combined amygdala-hippocampus–cortex slices containing the temporal
cortex, the perirhinal cortex, the entorhinal cortex, the subiculum, the dentate gyrus, the
hippocampus, as well as the amygdala (500 µm) were cut in a nearly horizontal plane.
Up to two different slices from each side were collected in a preparation. Slices were
stored at 28 °C in ACSF, which contained (in mm) NaCl, 124; KCl, 4; CaCl2, 1.0;
NaH2PO4, 1.24; MgSO4, 1.3; NaHCO3, 26; glucose, 10 (pH 7.4), oxygenated with
95% O2 and 5% CO2 for > 1 h. After 30-min incubation, CaCl2 was elevated to
2.0 mmol/L. Slices were individually transferred to an interphase recording chamber,
placed on a transparent membrane, illuminated from below and continuously perfused
(1.5–2 mL/min) with carbogenated ACSF at 32 °C. A warmed, humified 95% O2 and
5% CO2 gas mixture was directed over the surface of the slices.
Electrophysiological recordings
Extracellular field potentials were recorded with glass microelectrodes (150 mmol/l
NaCl; 2–10 M ) connected to the amplifier by an Ag/AgCl–KCl bridge in the third
layer of temporal neocortical tissues as well as in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal
CA1 and CA3 areas. Field potentials were traced by an ink-writer and recorded by a
digital oscilloscope.
Induction of neocortical SD
SD was elicited by KCl microinjection. A glass electrode filled with 2 M KCl was fixed
in a special holder connected with plastic tube to a pressure injector and the tip inserted
into the sixth layer of the neocortical slices. A high-pressure pulse was applied to inject
an amount of K+ in the tissue sufficient to induce cortical SD (tip diameter: 2 m;
injection pressure 0.5–1.0 bar applied for 200–300 ms, two injections, 1–3 nl per pulse).
14

Cortical SD-like events were evaluated with respect to their amplitude, duration and
velocity rates. SD duration was defined as the interval between the time of half-maximal
voltage shift during onset and recovery of the negative DC potential deflection.
Long-term potentiation
Single pulses of electrical stimulation were applied through a bipolar platinum electrode
attached to the white matter perpendicular to the recording electrode in the entorhinal
cortex. Evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) were recorded in the
third layer of the entorhinal cortex. The fEPSP was elicited by adjusting the intensity of
stimulation to 50% of that at which population spikes after fEPSP began to appear.
The amplitude of fEPSP 1 ms after the onset was measured for data analysis. In longterm potentiation (LTP) experiments, the cortex was sequentially stimulated once every
minute. Ten trains of four pulses (pulse duration 0.1 msec; interpulse interval 50 msec;
intensity 5 V) were repeated at intervals of 10 msec. LTP was operationally defined as
the mean change in fEPSP amplitude in response to five stimuli given 30 min after
tetanic stimulation compared with the mean response to five test pulses applied
immediately before the stimulation. Thus % potentiation = [(posttetanus amplitude of
fEPSP/baseline amplitude of fEPSP) 1] 100. Tetanic stimulation was applied 60 min
after application of drug.
Experimental procedure
After minimum 30 min incubation, SD was induced by KCl application in temporal
cortex. After another 15 min, several compounds were applied to the entorhinal cortex.
Compounds applied were: DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV; 50 μmol/L), 6cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione

(CNQX;

10

μmol/L),

N-Methyl-D-Aspartat

(NMDA; 10 μmol/L) bicuculline (10 μmol/L), 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 20 μmol/L), and
WIN 55212-2 (5 μmol/L). NMDA, APV, CNQX, bicuculline also applied in
accompanied with induction of LTP in the neocortex. The abovementioned drugs were
administered focally through microelectrodes on to slices (electrode tip diameter 2–3
15

μM, 0.5–2 bar; 500–800 ms, 3–5 nl). Drugs were released through microelectrodes on
to the surface of the slices. After 60 minutes application of drugs or application of
substances and LTP, second KCl injection was applied (SD2). The effect of wash-out of
these drugs on induction of KCl was tested after another 45 minutes (SD3).
Statistical analysis
All data are given as mean ± SEM. The data were statistically analysed using the Mann–
Whitney Rank Sum test. Significance was established when the probability values were
less than 0.05. The investigations were approved by the local ethics committee
(Tierversuchsgenehmigung, Bezirksregierung Münster, Deutschland, AZ: 50.0835.1.0,
G79/2002).

Results
The first focal application of KCl in the sixth layer of somatosensory neocortical tissues
elicited negative DC waves followed by positive waves (n = 12, amplitude of 14.1 ± 2.6
mV; duration of 118 ± 5 sec). Negative DC-deflections were preceded by small positive
waves in some slices. SD1 is only propagate through temporal neocortex and failed to
enter the entorhinal cortex. The second application of KCl after 45 minutes induced DC
negative deflection (19.5 ± 2.9 mV; duration of 143 ± 7 sec) which propagated to the
entorhinal cortex (6.5 ± 1.9 mV; duration of 103 ± 8 sec). SD2, however, did not
propagate to the hippocampus. The third application of KCl after another 45 minutes
elicited DC waves which propagated from the temporal neocortex to the entorhinal
cortex and then to the hippocampal CA1 area. SD3 has the amplitude of 14 ± 1.7 mV,
11 ± 2.1 mV, and 10 ± 2.2 mV and the duration of 139 ± 9 sec, 143 ± 7 sec, 101 ± 6 sec,
and 84 ± 7 sec in the temporal neocortex, the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal
CA1 area, respectively (figure 3).
The effect of APV on SD propagation
The first focal application of KCl in the sixth layer of the temporal neocortical tissues
produced negative DC deflections followed by positive waves (n = 8, amplitude of 18.1
± 3.6 mV; duration of 118 ± 5 sec). The first SD was only propagated in the temporal
neocortex. Application of APV at concentration of 50 μmol/L inhibited propagation of
SD to the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus in the second and third application of
KCl after 45 and 90 minutes after SD1. The amplitude and the duration of SD2 was
19.4 ± 3.2 mV and 138 ± 7 sec. SD3 was also appeared only in the temporal cortex with
the amplitude of 16.1 ± 3.1 mV and duration of 148 ± 4 sec (figure 4).

The effect of CNQX on SD propagation
The first focal application of KCl in the sixth layer of the temporal neocortical tissues
produced negative DC deflections (n = 8, amplitude of 12.1 ± 1.6 mV; duration of 98 ±
5 sec). The first SD was only propagated in the temporal neocortex. Application of
CNQX at concentration of 10 μmol/L, drastically changed the pattern of SD
propagation in combined neocortex-hippocampus slices. The second application of KCl
induced DC waves which were propagated to the entorhinal cortex as well as the
hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas. The amplitude of SD2 was 21.4 ± 2.2 mV, 24.2 ± 1.7
mV, 19 ± 1.7 mV, and 25 ± 1.7 mV in the temporal neocortex, the entorhinal cortex,
and CA1 and CA3 area of the hippocampus, respectively. The duration of SD2 was 180
± 11 sec, 166 ± 17 sec, 123 ± 12 sec, and 125 ± 17 sec in the temporal neocortex, the
entorhinal cortex, and CA1 and CA3 area of the hippocampus, respectively. Washout of
the CNQX for 45 minutes, however, did not change the pattern of SD propagation under
the effect of CNQX. After washout period, injection of KCl induced SD in the temporal
cortex. This SD propagated to the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 via the entorhinal cortex
(figure 5).
The effect of WIN 55212-2 on SD propagation
The first focal application of KCl in the temporal neocortical tissues produced negative
DC deflections (n = 8, amplitude of 17.1 ± 2.6 mV; duration of 198 ± 8 sec). The first
SD was only propagated in the temporal neocortex. Application of WIN 55212-2 (5
μmol/L), a potent cannabinoide receptor agonist, significantly changed the pattern of
SD propagation in the combined neocortex-hippocampus slices.

The second injection of KCl elicited negative DC waves which were propagated to the
entorhinal cortex as well as the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas. The amplitude of
SD2 was 18.4 ± 2.8 mV, 20 ± 2.7 mV, 17 ± 2.7 mV, and 11 ± 1.2 mV in the temporal
neocortex, the entorhinal cortex, and CA1 and CA3 area of the hippocampus,
respectively. The duration of SD2 was 168 ± 10 sec, 160 ± 14 sec, 173 ± 12 sec, and
165 ± 12 sec in the temporal neocortex, the entorhinal cortex, and CA1 and CA3 area of
the hippocampus, respectively. Wash-out of the WIN 55212-2 for 45 minutes, however,
did not change the pattern of SD propagation under the effect of WIN 55212-2. The
same as CNQX, after washout of WIN 55212-2, SD3 propagated to the hippocampal
CA1 and CA3 regions through the entorhinal cortex. The amplitude and the duration of
SD3 were not differing significantly with SD2 (figure 6).

The effect of 4-AP on SD propagation
The first local application of KCl in the sixth layer of the temporal neocortical tissues
induced negative DC fluctuations (n = 8, amplitude of 17.1 ± 2.6 mV; duration of 128 ±
5 sec). The first SD was only propagated in the temporal neocortex or in some slices
propagated to the entorhinal cortex (amplitude of 13.6 ± 2mV; duration of 108 ± 4 sec).
Application of 4-AP, a potassium channel blocker, at concentration of 20 μmol/L did
not alter the pattern of SD propagation in combined neocortex-hippocampus slices. SD2
was also only propagated to the temporal and entorhinal cortices. The amplitude and
duration of SD2 were not differed from SD1. Washout of the 4-AP for 45 minutes,
however, changed the pattern of SD propagation under the effect of 4-AP. After
washout period, injection of KCl induced SD in the temporal cortex. This SD
propagated to the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 via the entorhinal cortex (figure 7).

25

The effect of bicuculline on SD propagation
The first focal application of KCl in the sixth layer of the temporal neocortical tissues
produced negative DC deflections followed by positive waves (n = 8, amplitude of 26.1
± 2.6 mV; duration of 138 ± 7 sec). The first SD was only propagated in the temporal
neocortex. Application of bicuculline, GABAA receptor inhibitor, at concentration of
10 μmol/L did not facilitate or blocked propagation of SD to the entorhinal cortex and
the hippocampus in the second and third application of KCl after 45 and 90 minutes
after SD1. The amplitude and the duration of SD2 was 19.2 ± 2.3 mV and 126 ± 7 sec.
SD3 was also appeared only in the temporal cortex with the amplitude of 23.3 ± 2.1
mV and duration of 138 ± 6 sec (figure 8).
The effect of electrical stimulations on SD propagation
The first focal application of KCl in the sixth layer of the temporal neocortical tissues
produced negative DC deflections followed by positive waves (n = 8, amplitude of 9 ±
0.6 mV; duration of 98 ± 3 sec). The first SD was only propagated in the temporal
neocortex. Application of electrical stimulation to induce maximum fEPSP in the
entorhinal cortex each 60 sec did not change the propagation pattern of SD propagation
after 45 minutes. The amplitude and the duration of SD2 were 12.2 ± 3 mV and 103 ± 4
sec. However, after 45 minutes of ceasing electrical stimulation SD was recorded by all
electrodes inserted in the temporal and entorhinal cortices as well as in the hippocampal
CA1 and CA3 regions (figure 9).

The effect of induction of LTP in the entorhinal cortex on SD propagation
The first application of KCl in the sixth layer of the temporal neocortical tissues
produced negative DC deflections followed by positive waves (n = 8, amplitude of 24 ±
3.8 mV; duration of 110 ± 4 sec). The first SD was only propagated in the temporal
neocortex. Forty-five minutes after SD1, tetanic stimulation was applies in the
entorhinal cortex and induced a long-lasting enhancement of fEPSP amplitude (138 ±
4.8% of the baseline; figure 10). Application of tetanic electrical stimulation in the
entorhinal cortex did not change the propagation pattern of SD propagation after 45
minutes. The amplitude and the duration of SD2 were 21.2 ± 5 mV and 97 ± 3 sec.
However, after 45 minutes after LTP induction SD was recorded by all electrodes
inserted in the temporal and entorhinal cortices as well as in the hippocampal CA1 and
CA3 regions (figure 11).

Discussion
The present study shows how propagation of SD between the neocortex and the
hippocampus can modulate with different substances as well as by electrical
stimulation. Repetitive SD enhanced the chance of penetration of the hippocampus by
negative deflection of SD wave. Furthermore, blocking of AMPA receptors as well as
potassium ion channels and activation of cannabinoide receptors facilitated the
propagation of SD to the hippocampus via the entorhinal cortex. In contrary, blocking
of glutamate NMDA sub-receptors and GABAA receptors inhibited the effect of
repetitive SD to enhancing the possibility of cortical SD propagation to the
hippocampus. Application of repetitive electrical stimulation as well as induction of
LTP did not change the propagation pattern of the second SD in our experiments.
However, these stimulations facilitated the propagation of cortical SD to the
hippocampus after 90 minutes (SD3). Blocking of AMPA receptors either before or
after LTP induction and blocking of NMDA receptors before induction of LTP limited
the propagation of SD to the temporal cortex. Application of NMDA receptor blocker
APV after LTP induction had no effect on late facilitatory effect of LTP on propagation
pattern of repetitive SD.
Intrinsic optical imaging as well as bioelectrical recordings revealed different patterns
of SD propagation in hippocampal and entorhinal slices (Buchheim et al., 2002;
Wernsmann et al., 2006). All data indicated of a resistance of the entorhinal cortex for
penetration by cortical SD. Although the exact mechanisms responsible for difficulty of
cortical SD propagation to the entorhinal cortex are not clear, some hypotheses can be
derived from experimental data. A traditional view assumes that the entorhinal cortex
faithfully transmits neocortical inputs to the hippocampus and the hippocampus inputs
to the neocortex (Naber et al., 1999). More recent evidence suggests that the entorhinal
cortex is more than a simple relay between the neocortex and hippocampus. The
entorhinal cortices contribute to the gating of impulses between these brain structures.
Local inhibition and intrinsic membrane properties of entorhinal neurons are major
factors limiting impulse traffic across the entorhinal cortex (Pelletier et al., 2004). This
may be the reason that induction of LTP and continuous stimulation changed the SD
38

propagation between those structures. In line with this, physiological studies have
disclosed the existence of powerful inhibition in the entorhinal cortex (Finch et al.,
1986; Jones & Buhl, 1993; Funahashi & Stewart, 1998), which may act to abort the
propagation of SD.
In addition, some studies indicated relative difficulties of SD occurrence in the
hippocampus compared with the entorhinal cortex (Dalby & Mody, 2003; Faria &
Mody, 2004). The failure of cortical SD to spread to the hippocampus was reported
earlier (Fifkova, 1964). The release of glutamate is essential to the propagation of
cortical SD (Van Harreveld & Fifkova, 1973). Several studies have shown that
glutamate acts via NMDA receptors during the generation and propagation of SD
(Mody et al., 1987; Gorji, 2001). The NMDA receptors are assembled from NR1
subunits and at least one subtype of the four members of the NR2(A–D) subunits
family. NR2B subunits are essential to the generation and propagation of SD in the
entorhinal cortical slices (Faria & Mody, 2004). The physiological characteristics and
possibly the localization of NR2B subunits at synapses differ between the entorhinal
cortex and the hippocampus (Gordey et al., 2001; Faria & Mody, 2004), which, in turn,
may influence SD penetration into the hippocampus. This can be relevant in our study
with the effect of blocking NMDA receptors on SD propagation through the entorhinal
cortex. Blocking of NMDA receptors inhibited the propagation of SD to the entorhinal
cortex. Furthermore, induction of LTP is accompanied by activation of NMDA
receptors. Therefore, the effect of LTP on SD propagation in the entorhinal cortex may
be related to its alteration in NMDA receptor architecture.
Seventy per cent of CSD waves propagating from temporal cortex slices penetrated to
adjacent entorhinal cortex slices and stopped there, whereas the remaining 30% reached
CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampal slices (Wernsmann et al., 2006). On the other
hand, CSD elicited from the somatosensory neocortex of anaesthetized rats did not
penetrate into the hippocampus (Wernsmann et al., 2006). This suggests that the CSD
recording in slices offers better conditions for SD propagation probably due to
weakening of intrahippocampal inhibitory mechanisms. In our study, the relationships
39

between two sides hippocampus was failed and this may influence the propagation of
SD.
The entorhinal cortex, a palaeocortical area, receives projections from secondary and
higher associative areas of the neocortex. Regions of both ipsilateral frontal and
temporal lobes are found to contribute afferents to this region of the brain. The
association areas from the primary sensory modalities of vision, audition, and
somesthesis project to multimodal convergence areas in the frontal and parietal lobes
(Pandya & Kuypers, 1969). Both multimodal regions project in turn to the cingulate
gyrus on the medial surface of the hemisphere, which contributes a heavy supply of
afferents to the presubiculum and entorhinal cortex (Jones & Powell, 1970). Therefore,
the entorhinal cortex is a final cortical link between the sensory systems of the
neocortex and the hippocampus of the limbic system and plays a role as a filter between
these two structures. From the entorhinal inputs, the hippocampus receives highly
complex and differentiated signals, coding information about the properties of the
applied stimuli. The entorhinal cortical neurons constitute the direct perforant path and
the crossed temporoammonic path to the hippocampus. They terminate on dendritic
branches of CA1–CA3 and the dentate fascia neurons (Van Hoesen et al., 1972).
Transient sensory cortical dysfunction induced by abortive SD enhanced hippocampal
activity (Wernsmann et al., 2006). This suggests an inhibitory tone mediated through
neocortical influence on hippocampal plasticity. In our study, application of GABAA
blocker inhibited propagation of SD to the hippocampus via the entorhinal cortex. This
may related to the manipulation of this inhibitory inputs of the entorhinal cortex to the
hippocampus. Our conclusion is supported by recent evidence indicating that
elimination of cortical input resulted in increased reactivity and complete disappearance
of habituation, with prolongation of tonic responses in the hippocampus (Vinogradova,
2001). Lesions of the entorhinal cortex in adolescent rats also resulted in enhancement
of spontaneous locomotor activities, an effect possibly mediated by postsynaptic
hypersensitivity (Sumiyoshi et al., 2004).

40

LTP is an experimental phenomenon, which can be used to demonstrate the repertoire
of long-lasting modifications of which individual synapses are capable. LTP remains
one of the prime candidates for mediating learning and memory as well as many other
forms of experience-dependent plasticity (Malenka & Bear, 2004). Functional
disruption of neocortical input to the hippocampus induced by abortive SD in both in
vitro and ex vivo experiments enhanced the LTP in the CA1 hippocampal area
ipsilateral to SD initiation (Wernsmann et al., 2006). Enhancement of LTP by abortive
SD was NMDA receptor dependent. Our data indicate the modulatory role of the
changes of synaptic strength by LTP induction on SD propagation. In line with our
results, CSD visualized using manganese-enhanced MRI following topical application
of KCl to the exposed rat cortex revealed signal enhancement in CA1–3 areas, the
subiculum and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (Henning et al., 2005).
Some evidence implicates the hippocampus in spatial memory and navigation, learning
and emotion (Jensen & Lisman, 2005). This structure is also related primarily to the
control of gross movements, such as locomotion and changes in posture, and involved
in certain aspects of the pituitary–adrenocortical system. Amnesia, emotional
disturbances, hyperactivity, yawning, and fluid retention were observed in hippocampal
dysfunction as well as during migraine attacks (Bures et al., 1974; Isaacson & Pribram,
1975; Dalessio, 1980; Daquin et al., 2001). SD in animal experiments also elicits similar
symptoms (Gorji, 2001). SD-like changes occur with visual aura in patients with
migraine (Hadjikhani et al., 2001). Propagation of depolarizing waves in sensory
systems of the neocortex may directly affect primary sensory modalities and induce aura
symptoms such as visual hallucinations. SD, both indirectly via the effect on entorhinal
input to the hippocampus or directly by propagation to the hippocampal structure, may
disturb the hippocampal function and lead to symptoms such as amnesia or
hyperactivity during migraine attacks. This study, therefore, collected data that how
may influence the SD propagation to the hippocampus by different substance and
electrical stimulations. This may help for further steps to design pharmacological or
interventional methods to support hippocampus from affecting by cortical SD.
