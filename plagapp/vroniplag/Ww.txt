Introduction

1.1 dsRNA, siRNA, miRNA and shRNA

1.1.1 dsRNA
Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is RNA with two complementary strands,
similar to the DNA. dsRNA forms the genetic material of some viruses. In
eukaryotes, it acts as a trigger to initiate the process of RNA interference
(RNAi) and presents as an intermediate step in the formation of siRNA (small
interfering RNAs). Recently, dsRNA has been found to induce gene
expression at the transcriptional level, a phenomenon named “small RNA
induced gene activation RNAa”. Such dsRNA is called “small activating RNA
(saRNA)”.

1.1.2 siRNA
Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), sometimes known as short interfering RNA
or

silencing

RNAs,

represent

a

class

of

20-25

nucleotide-long

double-stranded RNA molecules that play a variety of roles in biology.
siRNAs have a well defined structure: a short (usually 21-nt) double-strand of
RNA (dsRNA) with 2-nt 3’ overhangs on either end. Each strand has a 5’
phosphate group and a 3’ hydroxyl (-OH) group. This structure is the result of
processing by Dicer, an enzyme that converts either long dsRNA or hairpin
RNAs into siRNAs (Baulcombe et al, 1999).

Most notably, siRNAs are involved in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway

1. Introduction

2

where the siRNA interferes with the expression of a specific gene (Tuschl et al,
2001). In addition to their role in the RNAi pathway, siRNAs also act in
RNAi-related pathways, as an antiviral mechanism or in shaping the
chromatin structure of a genome. siRNAs can also be exogenously (artificially)
introduced into cells by various transfection methods to bring about the
specific knockdown of a gene of interest. Essentially any gene of which the
sequence is known can thus be targeted based on sequence complementarity
with tailored siRNA. This has made siRNA an important tool for gene function
and drug target validation studies in the post-genomic era.

1.1.3 miRNA
The vast majority of genomic DNA does not encode protein sequences and
was considered “junk” that only contributes to the evolution of genes due to
recombination events. However, very recently this concept had to be
completely rewritten. Hundreds of short RNAs have been identified that stem
from these “noncoding” regions and many more are likely to exist. These
microRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression.
In genetics, miRNAs are single-stranded RNA molecules of about 21-23
nucleotides in length, which regulate gene expression. miRNAs are encoded
by genes that are transcribed from DNA but not translated into protein
(non-coding RNA); instead they are processed from primary transcripts known
as pri-miRNAs to short stem-loop structures called pre-miRNAs and finally to
function miRNAs. Mature miRNA molecules are partially complementary to
one or more messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, and their main function is to
down-regulate gene expression.
1.1.3.1 Formation and processing of miRNA
The genes encoding miRNAs are much longer than the processed mature
miRNA molecule; miRNAs are first transcribed as primary transcripts or
pri-miRNAs with a cap and poly-A tail and processed to short, 70-nucleotide
stem-loop structures known as pre-miRNAs in the cell nucleus. This

1. Introduction

3

processing is performed in animals by a protein complex known as the
Microprocessor complex, consisting of the nuclease Drosha and the
double-stranded RNA binding protein Pasha (Denli et al, 2004). These
pre-miRNAs are then processed to mature miRNAs in the cytoplasm by
interaction with the endonuclease Dicer, which also initiates the formation of
the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (Bernstein et al, 2001). This
complex is responsible for the gene silencing observed due to miRNA
expression and RNA interference. The pathway in plants varies slightly due to
the lack of Drosha homologs; instead, Dicer homologs alone affect several
processing steps (Kurihara and Watanabe, 2004).

It has been shown that the efficient processing of pre-miRNAs by Drosha
requires the presence of extended single-stranded RNAs on both 3'- and
5'-ends of hairpin molecules (Zeng et al, 2005). This study showed that these
motifs could be of different composition while their defined length is of high
importance for processing to take place. Findings were confirmed in another
work by Han et al (2004). Using bioinformatics tools the folding of 321 human
and 68 fly pri-miRNAs was analysed. 280 human and 55 fly pri-miRNAs were
selected for further study excluding those molecules where folding showed
the presence of multiple loops. All human and fly pri-miRNAs contained very
similar structural regions, which the authors called ‘'basal segments'’, ‘'lower
stem'’, '’upper stem'’ and ‘'terminal loop'’. Based on the encoding position of
miRNAs, in the 5'-strand (5'-donors) or 3'-strand (3'-donors), thermodynamic
profiles of pri-miRNAs were determined (Zeng et al, 2005). Subsequent
experiments showed that Drosha complex cleaves RNA molecules ~2 helical
turns away from the terminal loop and ~1 turn away from basal segments. In
most analyzed molecules this region contains unpaired nucleotides and the
free energy of the duplex is relatively high compared to lower and upper stem
regions (Zeng and Cullen, 2005).
Most pre-miRNAs don't have a perfect double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
structure topped by a terminal loop. There are few possible explanations for

1. Introduction

4

such selectivity. One could be that dsRNAs longer than 21 base pairs activate
an interferon response and the anti-viral machinery in the cell. Another
plausible explanation could be that the thermodynamical profile of
pre-miRNAs determines which strand will be incorporated into the Dicer
complex. Indeed, the aforementioned study by Han et al. demonstrated very
clear similarities between pri-miRNAs encoded in respective (5'- or 3'-)
strands.
When Dicer cleaves the pre-miRNA stem-loop, two complementary short
RNA molecules are formed, but only one becomes integrated into the RISC
complex. This strand is known as the guide strand and is selected by the
argonaute protein, the catalytically active RNase in the RISC complex, on the
basis of the stability of the 5' end (Preall et al, 2006). The remaining strand,
known as the anti-guide or passenger strand is degraded as a RISC complex
substrate (Gregory et al, 2005). After integration into the active RISC complex,
miRNAs base pair with their complementary mRNA molecules and induce
mRNA degradation by argonaute proteins. It is as yet unclear how the
activated RISC complex locates the mRNA targets in the cell, though it has
been shown that the process is not coupled to ongoing protein translation
from the mRNA (Sen et al, 2005).

1.1.3.2 Cellular functions of miRNA
The miRNAs appear to be important for gene regulation. An individual miRNA
is complementary to a part of one or more messenger RNAs (mRNAs).
Animal miRNAs are usually complementary to a site in the 3' UTR whereas
plant miRNAs are usually complementary to coding regions of mRNAs. The
annealing of the miRNA to the mRNA then inhibits protein translation, but
sometimes facilitates cleavage of the mRNA. This is thought to be the primary
mode of action of plant miRNAs. In such cases, the formation of the
double-stranded RNA through the binding of the miRNA triggers the
degradation of the mRNA transcript through a process similar to RNAi, though

1. Introduction

5

in other cases it is believed that the miRNA complex blocks the protein
translation machinery or otherwise prevents protein translation without
causing the mRNA to be degraded. miRNAs may also target methylation of
genomic sites which correspond to targeted mRNAs. miRNAs function in
association with a complement of proteins collectively termed the miRNP
(micro-ribonucleic protein).

This effect was first described for the worm C. elegans in 1993 (Lee et al.,
1993). As of 2002, miRNAs have been confirmed in various plants and
animals, including C. elegans, human and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
Genes have been found in bacteria that are similar in the sense that they
control mRNA abundance or translation by binding a mRNA by base pairing,
however they are not generally considered to be miRNAs because the Dicer
enzyme is not involved.

In plants, similar RNA species termed short-interfering RNAs are used to
prevent the transcription of viral RNA. While this siRNA is double-stranded,
the mechanism seems to be closely related to that of miRNAs, especially
taking the hairpin structures into account. siRNAs are also used to regulate
cellular genes, as miRNAs do.

1.1.4 shRNA
Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are a sequence of RNAs that makes a tight
hairpin turn and are transcribed by RNA polymerase Ⅲ. It uses a vector
introduced into cells and utilizes the U6 promoter to ensure that the shRNA is
always expressed and can be cleaved by the cellular machinery into siRNA,
which is then bound to the RISC silencing gene expression via RNAi
(Brummelkamp et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2002; Miyagishi and Tiara, 2002;

RNAi

was

much

more

effective

than

antisense

oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) targeted to the same gene (Miyagashi et al.,
2003) and showed a longer duration of the inhibitory effect on the
corresponding mRNA level (Bertrand et al., 2002).
Meanwhile, RNA polymerase Ⅲ-based shRNA expression vector systems
have been established to induce RNAi in mammalian cells (Brummelkamp et
al., 2002; Lee et al., 2002; Miyagishi and Tiara, 2002; Paul et al., 2002; Yu et
al., 2002). Although these vectors provide certain advantages over chemically
synthesized siRNAs, some disadvantages still remain, including transient
shRNA expression and low transfection efficiency, especially in primary
non-dividing cells. Because mammals apparently lack mechanisms that
amplify silencing in worms and plants, siRNA –induced gene inactivation
seems to be transient (Hannon, 2002). To overcome these limitations, shRNA
delivery systems using lentiviral vectors have been developed. These
systems produce shRNAs intracellularly and often rely on promoters
dependent on RNA polymerase Ⅲ, such as U6 (Abbas et al., 2002; Qin et al.,
2003). The U6 promoter efficiently expresses shRNAs which undergo Dicer
processing into 21-nucleotide duplex dsRNA in mammalian cultured cells and
RNA polymerase Ⅲ promoters are active in all mammalian tissues (Wall and
Shi, 2003). One of the advantages of using the lentivirus system over a
plasmid-based expression system is to maintain the transferred shRNAs
stably integrated into the host chromosomal DNA without time-consuming
drug-selection procedures. Another advantage to the lentivirus-mediated
gene delivery system is its highly efficient transduction ability. This is of
particular importance for post-mitotic primary non-dividing cells, such as stem
cells, dendritic cells and neurons (Naldini et al., 1996; Pfeifer et al, 2002;
Scherr and Eder, 2002; Stewart et al., 2003; Rubinson et al, 2003; Hironori
Nishitsuji et al., 2004).

1. Introduction

7

shRNAs can also be made for use in plants and other systems, and are not
necessarily driven by a U6 promoter. In plants the traditional promoter for
strong constitutive expression (in most plant species) is the cauliflower
mosaic virus 35S promoter (CaMV35S), in which case RNA polymerase Ⅱ is
used to express the transcript destined to initiate RNAi.

1.2 RNA interference
RNA interference (RNAi) was a term coined by Fire and coworkers to
describe the inhibition of gene expression by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs)
when introduced into nematode worms (Caenorhabditis elegans). Following
on from the studies of Guo and Kemphues (1995), who had found that sense
RNA was as effective as antisense RNA for suppressing gene expression in
worms, Fire et al. (1998) applied single-stranded antisense RNA and double
stranded RNA in their experiments. To their surprise, they found that dsRNA
was more effective in producing interference than was either strand
individually. After injection into adult C. elegans, single-stranded antisense
RNA had a modest effect in diminishing specific gene expression, whereas
double-stranded mixtures caused potent and specific interference.
Today we know that RNAi is a multistep process involving the generation of
small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in vivo through the action of the RNase III
endonuclease “Dicer”. The resulting 21- to 23-nt siRNAs mediate the
degradation of their complementary RNA (Shi, 2003).
A major breakthrough in the elucidation of the underlying mechanism was the
biochemical analysis of RNAi using Drosophila embryo or cell extracts (Tuschl
et al., 1999; Hammond et al., 2000; Zamore et al., 2000), which led to the
identification of the dsRNA processing enzyme Dicer (Bernstein et al., 2001a)
as well as the RNA induced silencing complex, RISC (Hammond et al., 2000),
which executes RNAi by using the small dsRNA species generated by Dicer
as guidance molecules to target the homologous, endogenous mRNA for

8

1. Introduction

degradation (Elbashir et al., 2001b,c; Zamore et al., 2000). These discoveries
led to the rapid improvement of RNAi tools, tailored to the needs of the
various experimental systems, and triggered intense genetic and biochemical
research into the molecular basis and regulation of RNAi (Hammond et al.,
2001b; Tijsterman et al., 2002). It became clear that RNAi is a highly
conserved mechanism that functions in many different cellular pathways from
regulating gene expression to fighting infection and the dangers of mobile
genetic elements.

1.2.1 Mechanism of RNAi
The genetic and biochemical analysis of RNAi has led to a model, in which
RNAi can be divided into two distinct phases: an initiation and an execution
phase. The initiation phase involves the processing of dsRNA into siRNA. In
the

execution

phase,

siRNAs

are

then

incorporated

into

large

ribonucleoprotein complexes. These effector complexes interfere with gene
expression by using the small RNA strand to identify their complementary
mRNA, which becomes cleaved and degraded. In a related pathway, short
non-coding single stranded RNAs, which are derived from partially
complementary dsRNA precursor molecules, are used to regulate the
translation of mRNAs harbouring complementary sequences in their 3’UTRs
(Fig. 1).
1.2.1.1 Initiation phase: dsRNA processing into siRNAs
The goal of the initiation step of RNAi is the generation of siRNAs from long
dsRNAs or mature miRNAs from their primary transcripts. This is achieved by
the action of two families of RNase III-dependent genes, Dicer and Drosha.
RNase III enzymes fall into three classes (Nicholson, 2003). Class I enzymes,
found in bacteria and yeast, contain a single RNase III domain joined to a
dsRBD (dsRNA binding domain proteins). Class II and III enzymes contain
two RNase III catalytic domains. Class III enzymes are further characterized

1. Introduction

Fig. 1. Mechanism of RNAi (adopted from Cullen BR., 2004). The processing pathway
proceeds from transcription through nuclear processing, nuclear export, cytoplasmic
processing by Dicer and finally to incorporation into RISC. This results in the initial primary
miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA) being processed to a pre-miRNA and finally to a miRNA duplex
intermediate, one strand of which then serves as a substrate for RISC incorporation. The
assembled RISC can then target mRNAs bearing a perfectly complementary target site for
degradation or can inhibit the translation of an mRNA that contains multiple, partly
mismatched target sites. Entry points for designed siRNAs are shown at the left of the figure.
These include synthetic siRNA duplexes and shRNAs, transcribed from expression plasmids,
which closely mimic pre-miRNAs. Finally, artificial miRNA genes can also be used to express
novel siRNAs.

by a helicase domain and a PAZ (Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille) domain. This last
domain is also present in Argonaute family proteins, already known to be
essential for RNAi, which led to the proposal that Class III enzymes are the
initiator of RNAi (Bass, 2000).
The generation of a siRNA from dsRNA potentially requires four
endonucleolytic reactions. It has been revealed that Dicer acts as a monomer,
using two endonucleolytic reactions to generate one new terminus (Zhang et
al, 2004). This would occur if Dicer binds to an existing terminus and makes a
cut ~21 nucleotides from the end (Schütze, 2004). If however the enzyme can
not initiate processing from the end and is forced to cut internally, the reaction
becomes significantly delayed. Once binding of Dicer occurred and a single
new terminus is created, further processing occurrs at normal rates, since the
enzyme now has terminal ends from which to process.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as long primary
transcripts (Kim, 2005). The active miRNA species, termed the mature RNA,
is present in a stem–loop structure within the primary transcript. The
stem–loop can be located in an exon or in an intron. For example, the
miRNAs miR-106b, miR-93, and miR-25 are located within an intron of the
protein coding gene mcm-7. After transcription, the miRNAs are processed
from the primary transcript, and the spliced mRNA is exported and translated .
Sequential processing of the primary transcript by the RNase III enzymes
Drosha and Dicer liberates the mature RNA. Drosha cleavage releases the
stem–loop, termed the precursor, which is exported from the nucleus in an
exportin-5/RAN-GTPase-dependent manner. In the cytoplasm, the precursor
is processed into a siRNA-like structure by Dicer. Drosha generates a 2 nt 3’
overhang terminus on the precursor which is recognized by the PAZ domain
of Dicer, analogous to the recognition of dsRNA termini. The double stranded
miRNA is incorporated into RISC in a similar manner as siRNAs.
Drosha is a Class II enzyme. This enzyme assumes a pseudo-dimer catalytic

11

1. Introduction

core similar to Dicer (Han et al, 2004). The substrates of Drosha, miRNA
primary transcripts, are structurally distinct from Dicer substrates. Drosha
does not process from a dsRNA terminus. Rather, data suggests that
primarily the stem–loop structure is recognized. In particular, the loop size
appears to be important for recognition (Zeng et al, 2005). In addition,
unstructured sequences flanking the stem–loop are essential for processing
(Chen et al, 2004; Zeng et al, 2005). It is not evident how Drosha is able to
recognize these sequences, as they are outside of the dsRNA stem. Possibly
other unidentified cofactors play a role. Conserved sequence elements have
been found in flanking regions of C. elegans miRNAs (Ohler et al, 2004).
1.2.1.2

Execution

phase:

assembly

of

siRNA

containing

silencing complexes
Dicer-generated siRNAs are then incorporated into a large multiprotein
complex, which is involved in various gene-silencing modes, and is called the
RNA induced silencing complex, or RISC (Hammond et al, 2000; Nykanen et
al, 2001). Processing of dsRNA and assembly of a functional RISC likely
occurs in the cytoplasm, as Dicer is a cytosolic enzyme and RISC activity can
be purified from the cytosol (Billy et al, 2001). R2D2, a Drosophila gene
related to the C. elegans RNAi gene RDE-4, has been implicated in the
transfer of siRNAs into the RISC (Liu et al, 2003). Generation of siRNAs from
dsRNA in Drosophila embryo extracts, unwinding of the siRNA duplex, and
incorporation into the RISC requires ATP (Nykanen et al, 2001). In contrast,
human Dicer does not seem to rely on ATP for processing of dsRNA into
siRNA molecules (Zhang et al., 2002).
Chromatographic purification of RISC nuclease activity from Drosophila cells
revealed several RISC components. The first identified component was
Argonaute2 (Ago2) (Hammond et al, 2001). This protein is a member of a
gene family conserved in most eukaryotic and several prokaryotic genomes.
The C. elegans homolog, rde-1, was previously identified in a genetic screen
for RNAi-deficient mutants, reinforcing its connection with RNAi (Tabara et al,

1. Introduction

12

1999). Structurally, this protein family is characterized by two domains, the
PAZ domain and the PIWI domain. Structures for both domains have been
solved. Additional RISC components with unknown roles in RNAi have also
been identified. These include the RNA binding protein VIG, the Drosophila
homolog of the Fragile X protein, dFXR, helicase proteins, and Tudor-SN
(Ishizuka et al, 2002; Caudy et al, 2003). This last protein has five
staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) domains and a Tudor domain.
In humans, there are four closely related Argonaute family members, named
Ago1-4. All four bind siRNAs and miRNAs at similar levels, and are widely
expressed. Only Ago2, however, is present in a cleavage-competent
RISC-complex (Meister et al, 2004). Similarly, siRNA-mediated knockdown,
or targeted knockout, of Ago2 impaired RNAi of a reporter, while knockdown
of Ago1, 3, 4 had no effect. The crystal structure of an Argonaute family
member from Pyrococcus furiosus has been revealed (Song et al, 2004). The
structure displayed an RNaseH fold for the signature PIWI domain. The
crystal structure of a second archaean argonaute, Archaeoglobus fulgidus
Piwi (AfPiwi), confirmed the RNaseH fold (Parker et al, 2004). The final
demonstration that Slicer activity was contained within Ago2 was the
reconstitution of minimal RISC with bacterially expressed, purified Ago2 and a
single-stranded siRNA (Rivas et al, 2005).

1.2.2 Therapeutic applications of RNAi
The therapeutic applications of RNAi are potentially enormous. The genetic
etiology of many disorders has now been defined and, in some cases, has
been targeted by RNAi in in vitro and in vivo model systems. Because the
specificity of RNAi is governed by sequence complementarity between the
siRNA and the target RNA, the most obvious application would be to treat
diseases in which genetic polymorphisms within the disease-inducing gene in
a particular lesion or tumor can be targeted for degradation without affecting
RNA from wild-type alleles.

1. Introduction

1.2.2.1 Cancer
There are two general abnormalities in cancer cells that exhibit a
dysregulation of the cell cycle resulting in uncontrolled growth and are
resistant to death as a result of abnormalities in one or more proteins that
mediate apoptosis (Nam and Parang, 2003). The goals for RNAi approaches
for cancer therapy are therefore to silence the expression of a cell cycle gene
and/or an anti-apoptotic gene in the cancer cells thereby stopping tumor
growth and killing the cancer cells. To selectively eliminate cancer cells
without damaging normal cells, the RNAi needs to be targeted to a gene
specifically involved in the growth or survival of the cancer cell, or the siRNAs
would be selectively delivered into the cancer cells.
The translocation of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) generates a fusion
gene called BCR-ABL. The translation product of this gene creates a
constitutively active protein tyrosine kinase that induces and maintains
leukemic transformation in chronic myelogenous leukemia and Ph-positive
acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The siRNAs specific for the BCR-ABL
transcript have been shown to silence the oncogenic fusion transcripts without
affecting expression levels of normal c-ABL and c-BCR transcripts (Scherr et
al, 2003; Wohlbold et al, 2003).
Pancreatic and colon carcinomas, in which RAS genes are often mutated,
provide another example for potential RNAi applications. In many cases, the
RAS oncogenes contain point mutations that differ by a single-base mutation
from their normal counterparts. The use of retroviral vectors to introduce
interfering RNAs specific for an oncogenic variant of KRAS (called K-RASV12)
reduced the level of K-RASV12 transcripts and resulted in a loss of
anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity (Brummelkamp et al,
2002). Studies of this kind provided proof-of-concept data for RNAi-based
strategies aiming to reverse tumorigenesis.
1.2.2.2 Infectious diseases

14

1. Introduction

The ability of RNAi to inhibit the replication or cellular uptake of viruses and
other infectious agents has been clearly demonstrated in cell culture studies
and, therefore, holds promise for the treatment of human patients. The ability
of HIV-1 to infect cells and replicate can be severely compromised by
targeting viral genes using siRNAs. Examples include the suppression of
HIV-1 replication in human cells transfected with siRNA directed against the
tat and the rev gene (Capodici et al, 2002; Jacque et al, 2002; Lee et al,
2002a; Novina et al, 2002). Transfection of human cells with siRNAs directed
against different genes in the poliovirus genome resulted in resistance of the
cells to infection with poliovirus (Gitlin et al., 2002). The ability of siRNAs
targeting the gene encoding the death receptor Fas to protect mice from liver
failure and fibrosis in two models of autoimmune hepatitis was tested by Song
and colleagues (Song et al., 2003). Intravenous injection of Fas siRNA
specifically reduced Fas protein levels in the livers of mice during a 10-day
period.

1.2.2.3 Neurodegenerative disorders
RNAi has been proven to be a successful experimental approach to alleviate
symptoms of diseases in transgenic animal models. For example, in inducible
mouse models of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and Huntington
disease, the repression of the mutant allele partially alleviates disease
phenotype. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing shRNA directed
against transgenic mutated human ataxin and injected into cerebellum
profoundly improved motor coordination, restored cerebellar morphology, and
resolved characteristic ataxin-1 inclusions in Purkinje cells of SCA1 mice (Xia
et al, 2004). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is another devastating
neurodegenerative disease, which is generally sporadic but in a small number
of cases is caused by the expression of a mutated form of Cu/Zn superoxide
dismutase (SOD1). Although the mutant SOD1 is toxic, the wild-type SOD1

15

1. Introduction

performs important functions. Therefore, a selective down-regulation of the
mutated isoform would be desirable. A specific siRNA covering the sequence
containing the point mutation has been tested in experimental models of SOD
dysfunction and showed that such an approach is feasable (Ding et al, 2003).
However, there are multiple forms of mutant SOD1 and not all mutant types
have been selectively inhibited by RNAi. An alternative approach has been
designed in which RNAi is used to inhibit both wild-type together with the
mutated form of SOD1. The wild-type SOD1 function is then replaced by an
engineered SOD1 gene resistant to the RNAi (Xia et al, 2005).
1.2.2.4 Drawbacks of RNAi therapeutics
Delivery is probably the single biggest obstacle to the development of
RNAi-based therapeutic agents. Trigger RNAs (dsRNAs from which siRNAs
are derived by the action of Dicer) can be expressed from vectors or delivered
as artificial siRNAs. A variety of strategies to express interfering RNAs with
the use of plasmid and virus vector-based cassettes have been explored (Li et
al, 2002; Dykxhoorn et al, 2003). Well-documented hazards of inserting
foreign vector sequences into chromosomal DNA include insertional
activation

and

inactivation

of

cellular

genes.

Direct

(intravenous)

administration of siRNAs would require siRNAs that are modified to be
resistant to nucleases and perhaps conjugated with a ligand to target the
siRNA to specific tissues. In mice, intravenous introduction of Fas siRNAs
leads to specific silencing of Fas mRNA in the liver (Song et al, 2003), so in
principle, unmodified siRNAs can be taken up by the liver and perhaps other
tissues. It is not clear, however, whether there are selective tissue sites for the
uptake of siRNAs and whether the lymphoid system or the brain, for instance,
is accessible by this route. Furthermore, the silencing effect of siRNAs is
short-lived, because the siRNAs eventually decay within the cell. In addition to
the danger of using vectors that integrate into the genome, the expression or
injection of siRNAs may also have unwanted biologic side effects.
Researchers are continually finding new cellular processes in which RNAi is
involved. Therefore, a stoichiometric excess of a virus-specific siRNA, for

1. Introduction

16

example, could saturate RNAi and interrupt the pathway’s normal functions in
the cell. Interferons, which form part of the host’s defense against viral
infection, are activated by long dsRNA (more than 500 bp). It is now apparent
that siRNAs (Sledz et al, 2003) as well as shRNAs expressed from DNA
vectors (Bridge et al, 2003) can trigger the activation of interferons. However,
there is no evidence that the activation of interferons by short RNAs
influences the degree or specificity of RNA silencing. In addition, these effects
have to be reconciled with the manufacturing in cells of many thousands of
copies of pre-miRNAs (Lagos et al, 2001) that do not appear to activate
interferons.

1.3 Transfection
Transfection describes the introduction of foreign DNA into eukaryotic cells.
Transfection typically involves opening transient “holes” or gates in the cell
plasma membrane, to allow the uptake of extracellular molecules, typically
supercoiled plasmid DNA, but also siRNA, among others. Cells that have
been manipulated to accept foreign DNA (cells with “holes”) are called
“competent cells”.

The primary challenge for gene transfection is to develop a method that
delivers a gene (transgene) to selected cells where proper gene expression
can be achieved. An ideal gene delivery method needs to meet 3 major
criteria: (1) it should protect the transgene against degradation by nucleases
in intercellular matrices, (2) it should bring the transgene across the plasma
membrane and into the nucleus of target cells, and (3) it should have no
detrimental effects (Gao et al, 2007).
Viral vectors are able to mediate gene transfer with high efficiency and the
possibility of long-term gene expression, and satisfy 2 out of 3 criteria. The
acute immune response, immunogenicity, and insertion mutagenesis have

1. Introduction

17

raised serious safety concerns about some commonly used viral vectors. The
limitation in the size of the transgene that recombinant viruses can carry and
issues related to the production of viral vectors present additional practical
challenges. Methods of nonviral gene delivery have also been explored using
physical (carrier-free gene delivery) and chemical approaches (synthetic
vector-based gene delivery). Physical approaches, including needle injection
(Wolff et al, 1990), electroporation (Heller et al, 2005), gene gun (Yang et al,
1990; Yang and Sun, 1995), ultrasound (Lawrie et al, 2000), and
hydrodynamic delivery (Liu et al, 1999; Zhang et al, 1999), employ a physical
force that permeates the cell membrane and facilitates intracellular gene
transfer. The chemical approaches (Mahato and Kim, 2002; Liu et al, 2003;
Neu et al, 2005) use synthetic or naturally occurring compounds as carriers to
deliver the transgene into cells. Although significant progress has been made
in the basic science and applications of various nonviral gene delivery
systems, the majority of nonviral approaches are still much less efficient than
viral vectors, especially for in vivo gene delivery.

1.3.1 Transfection by needle injection of naked DNA
Simple injection of plasmid DNA directly into a tissue without additional help
from either a chemical agent or a physical force is able to transfect cells. Local
injection of plasmid DNA into the muscle (Wolff et al, 1990), liver (Zhang et al,
1997), skin (Choate and Khavari, 1997), or airway instillation into the lungs
(Meyer et al, 1995), lead to a low-level of gene expression. Specific or
nonspecific receptors on the cell surface that bind and internalize DNA have
been implicated as a mechanism. Nevertheless, gene transfer with naked
DNA is attractive to many researchers because of its simplicity and lack of
toxicity. However, a broad application of naked DNA–mediated gene transfer
to gene therapy may not be conceivable because DNA, being large in size
and highly hydrophilic, is efficiently kept out of the cells in a whole animal by
several physical barriers. These include the blood endothelium, the interstitial
matrices, the mucus lining and specialized ciliate/tight junction of epithelial
cells, and the plasma membrane of all cells. In addition, DNA degradation by

1. Introduction

18

intra- and extracellular nuclease activities further reduces the chance that
DNA entering nuclei will be intact and functional.

1.3.2 Transfection by physical methods
Physical approaches have been explored for transfection into cells in vitro and
in vivo. Physical approaches induce transient injuries or defects on cell
membranes, so that DNA can enter the cells by diffusion. Gene delivery
employing mechanical (particle bombardment or gene gun), electric
(electroporation), ultrasonic, hydrodynamic (hydrodynamic gene transfer), or
laser-based energy has been explored in recent years.

1.3.2.1 Transfection by gene gun
Particle bombardment through a gene gun is an ideal method for transfection
of skin, mucosa, or surgically exposed tissues within a confined area (Yang et
al, 1990). DNA is deposited on the surface of gold particles, which are then
accelerated by pressurized gas and expelled onto cells or a tissue. The
momentum allows the gold particles to penetrate a few millimeters deep into a
tissue and to release DNA into cells on the path. Such a simple and effective
method of gene delivery is expected to have important applications as an
effective tool for DNA based immunization. Further improvements could
include chemical modification of the surface of the gold particles to allow
higher capacity and better consistency for DNA coating, and fine-tuning of the
expelling force for precise control of DNA deposition into cells in various
tissues.
1.3.2.2 Transfection by electroporation
Electroporation is a versatile method that has been extensively tested in many
types of tissues in vivo (Heller et al, 2005), among which skin and muscles are
the most extensively investigated, although the system should work in any
tissues into which a pair of electrodes can be inserted. Gene transfer by
electroporation showed less variation in efficiency across species than did

1. Introduction

19

direct DNA injection. The amount of DNA and how well the injected plasmid
DNA distributes within the treated tissue prior to electroporation appear to
have an important impact on transfection efficiency.
Several major drawbacks exist for in vivo application of electroporation. First,
it has a limited effective range of ~1cm between the electrodes, which makes
it difficult to transfect cells in a large area of tissues. Second, a surgical
procedure is required to place the electrodes deep into the internal organs.
Third, high voltage applied to tissues can result in irreversible tissue damage
as a result of thermal heating (Durieux et al, 2004). Ca2+ influx due to
disruption of cell membranes may induce tissue damage because of
Ca2+-mediated protease activation (Gissel and Clausen, 2001). The possibility
that the high voltage applied to cells could affect the stability of genomic DNA
is an additional safety concern. However, some of these concerns may be
resolvable by optimizing the design of electrodes, their spatial arrangement,
the field strength, and the duration and frequency of electric pulses.

1.3.2.3 Ultrasound-facilitated transfection
The discovery that ultrasound can facilitate gene transfer at cellular (Kim et al,
1996) and tissue levels (Liang et al, 2004) expands the methodology of gene
transfer by physical methods. A 10- to 20-fold enhancement of reporter gene
expression over that of naked DNA has been achieved. Unlike electroporation,
which moves DNA along the electric field, ultrasound creates membrane
pores and facilitates intracellular gene transfer through passive diffusion of
DNA across the membrane pores (Koch et al, 2000). The transfection
efficiency of this system is determined by several factors, including the
frequency, the output strength of the ultrasound applied, the duration of
ultrasound treatment (Huber et al, 1999), and the amount of plasmid DNA
used.
Consequently, the size and local concentration of plasmid DNA play an
important role in determining the transfection efficiency. Efforts to reduce DNA

1. Introduction

20

size for gene transfer by methods of standard molecular biology or through
proper formulation could result in further improvement. Interestingly,
significant enhancement has been reported in cell culture and in vivo when
complexes of DNA and cationic lipids have been used (Anwer et al, 2000).
Since ultrasound can penetrate soft tissue and be applied to a specific area, it
could become an ideal method for noninvasive gene transfer into cells of the
internal organs. Evidence supporting this possibility has been presented: in
one study, plasmid DNA was co-administered with a contrast agent to blood
circulation, and this was followed by ultrasound treatment of a selected tissue
(Unger et al, 2001). So far, the major problem for ultrasound-facilitated gene
delivery is low gene delivery efficiency.
1.3.2.4 Hydrodynamic transfection
Hydrodynamic gene delivery is a simple method that introduces naked
plasmid DNA into cells in highly perfused internal organs, such as the liver,
with an impressive efficiency (Liu et al, 1999). This simple, reproducible, and
highly efficient method for gene delivery has been used to express proteins of
therapeutic value such as hemophilia factors (Miao et al, 2003), alpha-1
antitrypsin (Alino et al, 2003), cytokines (Jiang et al, 2001), hepatic growth
factors (Yang et al, 2001), and erythropoietin (Maruyama et al, 2004) in
mouse and rat models. Depending on the plasmid construct and the
regulatory elements driving expression of the transgene, the level of gene
expression in some cases has reached or exceeded the physiological level.

1.3.3 Transfection by chemical methods
By far the most frequently studied strategy for nonviral gene delivery is the
formulation of DNA into condensed particles by using cationic lipids or
cationic polymers. The DNA containing particles are subsequently taken up
by cells via endocytosis, macropinocytosis, or phagocytosis in the form of
intracellular vesicles, from which a small fraction of the DNA is released into
the cytoplasm and migrates into the nucleus, where transgene expression
takes place.

21

1. Introduction

1.3.3.1 Cationic lipid-mediated transfection
Since 1987, it was first reported that a double chain monovalent quaternary
ammonium

lipid,

N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium

chloride, effectively binds and delivers DNA to cultured cells (Felgner et al,
1987), hundreds of new cationic lipids have been developed. These lipids
differ by the number of charges in their hydrophilic head group and by the
detailed structure of their hydrophobic moiety. Although some cationic lipids
alone exhibit good transfection activity, they are often formulated with a
noncharged phospholipid or cholesterol as a helper lipid to form liposomes.
Upon mixing with cationic liposomes, plasmid DNA is condensed into small
quasi-stable particles called lipoplexes. DNA in lipoplexes is well protected
from nuclease degradation. Lipoplexes are able to trigger cellular uptake and
facilitate the release of DNA from the intracellular vesicles before reaching
destructive lysosomal compartments.
Most of our understanding of lipid-mediated gene delivery derives from
characterization work on lipoplexes prepared in low-salt solution and
transfection tests on cells in the absence of interfering substances such as
serum. Under these conditions, the transfection efficiency of lipoplexes is
affected by (1) the chemical structure of the cationic lipid, (2) the charge ratio
between the cationic lipid and the DNA, (3) the structure and proportion of the
helper lipid in the complexes, (4) the size and structure of the liposomes, (5)
the total amount of the lipoplexes applied, and (6) the cell type. The first 4
factors determine the structure, charge property, and transfection activity of
the lipoplexes. The remaining 2 define the overall toxicity to the treated cells,
and the susceptibility of the cells to a particular lipid-based transfection
reagent. The chemical structure of the cationic lipid has a major impact on the
transfection efficiency. In general, multivalent lipids with long and unsaturated
hydrocarbon chains tend to be more efficient than monovalent cationic lipids
with the same hydrophobic chains. Transfection typically requires that the
cationic lipid be in slight excess over DNA such that the lipoplexes have net

1. Introduction

22

positive charges on the surface. Spontaneous lipid mixing in endosomes
becomes more profound when a non-bilayer-forming lipid such as
dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) is used as the helper lipid, rather
than a bilayer-forming lipid, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine. Inclusion of DOPE is
believed to increase membrane fluidity and facilitate lipid exchange and
membrane fusion between lipoplexes and the endosomal membrane.
Lipoplexes form spontaneously when cationic liposomes are mixed with DNA.
The process involves an initial rapid association of polycationic liposomes and
polyanionic DNA through electrostatic interaction, followed by a slower lipid
rearrangement process (Pedroso et al, 2001). The structure of lipoplexes is
influenced by multiple factors, including the charge ratio, the concentration of
individual lipids and DNA, the structure of the cationic lipid and the helper lipid,
the physical aggregation state of the lipids (multilamellar or unilamellar
liposomes, or micelles), the salt concentration, and the method of preparation.
Lipoplexes come in various forms, including fully condensed lipid/DNA
complexes, partially condensed lipid/DNA complexes, DNA sandwiched
between cationic lipid bilayers, lipid-coated DNA arranged in a hexagonal
lattice, or partially condensed DNA surrounded by a lipid bilayer (Lin et al,
2003). The simplest way to prepare lipoplexes is to mix diluted solutions of
plasmid DNA and preformed liposomes. The resulting lipoplexes are
generally heterogeneous in size and morphology. The heterogeneity is
primarily due to the relatively large sizes of DNA and liposomes, and the
multivariant nature of the interaction between the DNA and liposomes.
Alternative methods involving forms of lipid assembly other than liposomes
have been designed to overcome these problems. For example, direct
addition of DNA solution to a dried film of cationic lipid and DOPE promotes
entrapment of DNA within multilamellar liposomes, rather than sandwiching of
DNA between liposomes.
Toxicity related to gene transfer by lipoplexes has been observed. Acute
inflammation reactions have been reported in animals treated with airway

1. Introduction

23

instillation or intravenous injection of lipoplexes. Detailed toxicological studies
on one of the Genzyme Lipid formulations, GL-67/DOPE, revealed that the
cationic lipid contributes significantly to the toxicity observed (Ruiz et al, 2001).
Similar toxic effects are also noticeable in systemic gene delivery via the tail
vein with other types of cationic lipids. Symptoms include acute pulmonary
hypotension, induction of inflammatory cytokines, tissue infiltration of
neutrophils in lungs, decrease in white cell counts, and in some cases tissue
injury in liver and spleen (Yew and Scheule, 2005). In humans, various
degrees of adverse inflammatory reactions, including flu like symptoms with
fever and airway inflammation, were noted among subjects who received
aerosolized GL67 liposomes alone or lipoplexes. These early clinical data
suggested that these lipoplexes formulations are inadequate for use in
humans.
1.3.3.2 Transfection mediated by cationic polymer
Synthetic and naturally occurring cationic polymers constitute another
category of DNA carriers that have been used widely for gene delivery. Over
the years, a significant number of cationic polymers in linear or branched
configuration have been explored as carriers for in vitro and in vivo gene
delivery. These include polyethylenimine (PEI) (Chemin et al, 1998),
polyamidoamine (Rudolph et al, 2000) and polypropylamine dendrimers
(Schatzlein et al, 2005), polyallylamine, cationic dextran (Hosseinkhaini et al,
2004), chitosan, cationic proteins (polylysine, protamine, and histones), and
cationic peptides (Park et al, 2003). Although most cationic polymers share
the function of condensing DNA into small particles and facilitating cellular
uptake via endocytosis through charge-charge interaction with anionic sites
on cell surfaces, their transfection activity and toxicity differ dramatically. One
drawback in the use of PEI as a transfection reagent relates to its
nonbiodegradable nature (Fischer et al, 2003).
1.3.3.3 Transfection by lipid-polymer hybrid system
The reported lipid-polymer hybrid systems include DNA precondensed with

24

1. Introduction

polycations, then coated with either cationic liposomes, anionic liposomes, or
amphiphilic polymers with or without helper lipids (Lee et al, 2006).
When anionic, DOPE-rich liposomes are added to DNA-polycation complexes,
an extensive reorganization of the lipid membranes takes place following the
initial contact, resulting in lipid-polymer-DNA complexes with anionic lipid
coatings. This strategy overcomes the surface charge issue associated with
cationic lipid-polymer-DNA complexes. The cytotoxicity of the complexes is
reduced,

1.4 293FT cell lines
Human Embryonic Kidney cells, also known as HEK cells, HEK 293 or just
293 cells, are a cell line originally derived, as their name indicates, from
embryonic human kidney. HEK cells are very easy to grow and transfect very
readily and so are widely-used in cell biology research. They are also used by
biotechnology industry to produce therapeutic proteins and viruses for gene
therapy.

1.4.1 Origins of 293 cells
293 cells were generated by transformation of cultures of normal human
embryonic kidney cells with sheared adenovirus 5 DNA in the laboratory of
Alex Van der Eb in Leiden, Holland in the early 1970s. They are called HEK
for human embryonic kidney, while the number 293 roots from numbering of
experiments
In 1977, Frank Graham and coworkers at McMaster University successfully
transformed primary human embryo kidney (HEK) cells with DNA from human
adenovirus type 5 (HAd5), using a calcium phosphate precipitation technique.
The viral DNA was prepared by repeatedly forcing a solution of it through a 22
gauge needle, which effectively sheared it into small fragments, later to be

1. Introduction

25

incorporated by the HEK cells. Two of 8 studies, each averaging 20 HEK
cultures, produced successfully transformed HEK cells. In these two
experiments, after one month of exposure to the viral DNA fragments, a single
morphologically transformed colony appeared in one culture (Graham et al,
1977).
Isolation of the transformed colonies proved difficult. After approximately 75
days, however, a few morphologically transformed cells were observed.
These were selected by reducing the serum content of the culture from 10%
to 2% for several weeks. Once the transformed cells were established, at
about passage 6, the serum content was returned to 10%. Then followed a
crisis phase, which lasted over 3 months, during which the cells growth rate
declined substantially. This phase continued until passage 16 when a sharp
decrease in population doubling time occurred. This phenomenon also
occurred in sublines that had been frozen at passage 6. Following the
establishment of the HEK 293 line, cells were maintained in Eagle medium
supplemented with 10% calf serum and tryptose phosphate broth, and have
been subcultured for over 100 passages.
The process of transformation using sheared HAd5 DNA makes the HEK 293
line very sensitive to human adenovirus, and permissive to adenovirus DNA.
Adenoviruses which have traditionally been difficult to cultivate and assay
(e.g., human Ads 40 and 41) are more readily cultivated using HEK 293 cells.
This high susceptibility is probably due to the fact that HEK 293 cells
constitutively express HAd5-specific E1 proteins.
Subsequent analysis has shown that the transformation was brought about by
an insert consisting of -4.5 kilo bases from the left arm of the viral genome,
which became incorporated into human chromosome 19 (Louis et al, 1997).
For many years it was assumed that HEK 293 cells were generated by
transformation of either a fibroblastic, endothelial or epithelial cell all of which
are abundant in kidney. However the fact that the cells originated from

1. Introduction

26

cultured kidney cells does not clearly indicate the exact cellular origin of the
HEK 293, as embryonic kidney cultures may contain small numbers of almost
all cell types of the body. In fact Graham and coworkers more recently
provided evidence that HEK 293 cells and several other human cell lines
generated by adenovirus transformation of human embryonic kidney cells
have many properties of immature neurons, suggesting that the adenovirus
was taken up and transformed a neuronal lineage cell in the original kidney
culture (Shaw et al, 2002).

1.4.2 Applications of 293 cells
As an experimentally transformed cell line, HEK cells are not a particularly
good model for normal cells, cancer cells, or any other kind of cell that is a
fundamental object of research. However, they are extremely easy to work
with, being straightforward to culture and to transfect, and so can be used in
experiments in which the behaviour of the cell itself is not of interest. Typically,
these experiments involve transfection in a gene (or combination of genes) of
interest, and then analyzing the expressed protein; essentially, the cell is used
simply as a test tube with a membrane. The widespread use of this cell line is
due to its extreme transfectability by the calcium phosphate method,
achieving efficiencies approaching 100% as determined by FACS using a 2 x
PBS buffer. A lower efficiency might be achievable with an HBS buffer.
An important variant of this cell line is the 293T cell line that contains, in
addition, the SV40 large T antigen, that allows for episomal replication of
transfected plasmids containing the SV40 origin of replication. This allows for
amplification of transfected plasmids and extended temporal expression of
the desired gene products. Note that any similarly domesticated cell line can
be used for this fort of work; Hela, COS and Chinese Hamster Ovary cell are
common alternatives. Examples of such experiments include: A study of the
effects of drug on sodium channels; testing of an inducible RNAi system;
testing of an isoform-selective protein kinase C agonist; investigation of the
interaction between two proteins; analysis of a nuclear export signal in a

1. Introduction

27

protein (He et al, 1998).
A more specific use of HEK cells is in the propagation of adenoviral vectors.
Viruses offer an extremely efficient means of delivering genes into cells, since
this is what they have evolved to do, and are thus of great use as
experimental tools. However, as pathogens, they also present a degree of
danger to the experimenter. This danger can be avoided by the use of viruses
which lack key genes, and which are thus unable to replicate after entering a
cell. In order to propagate such viral vectors, a cell line that expresses the
missing genes is required. Since HEK cells express a number of adenoviral
genes, they can be used to propagate adenoviral vectors in which these
genes (typically, E1 and E3) are deleted, such as AdEasy. Another application
of 293, especially 293T, cells is commonly used for the production of lentiviral
and retroviral vectors. Various retroviral and lentiviral packaging cell lines are
based on these cells.

1.5 The aim of this study
A major problem of the current discussion of osteoporosis arises from the fact
that the age-related increase of adipose tissues in bone marrow and the
simultaneous decrease of osteoblasts may contribute to bone-associated
diseases like osteoporosis and osteopenia. Besides the possibility of a
decreased capability of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), the
multipotential cells that can differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes, to
differentiate into osteoblasts, transdifferentiation of committed osteoblasts into
adipocytes could at least partly account for the age-related shift towards
adipogenic degeneration. In this process, we want to know which gene or
genes may contribute to the age-related expansion of adipose tissue in
human bone marrow.
In our laboratory, a cell culture system of human mesenchymal stem cells was
established that allows not only for osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation

28

1. Introduction

but also for transdifferentiation of committed precursors and/or differentiated
cells between both cell lineages (Schilling et al, 2007a). Comparing
transdifferentiated adipocytes with committed osteoblasts and vice versa by
microarray analyses revealed a large number of regulated transcripts, many
of them associated with signal transduction, metabolism, and transcription but
mostly distinct from established inducing factors of normal adipogenic and
osteogenic differentiation, respectively (Schilling et al., 2007a and 2007b).
Some of selected genes were analyzed by RT-PCR which comfirmed the data
of the microarray analyses.
Furthermore, it was noticed that mRNA species that are regulated during the
initiation of transdifferentiation could represent possible control factors for the
transdifferentiation

for

both,

adipogenic

and

osteogenic

transdifferentiation. In order to evaluate the relevance of individual genes, our
laboratory designed a scoring scheme to rank genes according to
reproducibility, regulation level, and reciprocity between the different
transdifferentiation directions. Therefore, members of several signaling
pathways like FGF, IGF, and Wnt signaling showed explicitly differential and
reciprocal

expression

patterns.

Additional

bioinformatic

analyses

of

microarray data allowed us to identify potential key factors associated with
transdifferentiation of adipocytes and osteoblasts, respectively (Schilling et al,
2007b).
In general, the aim of this study was to: (1) develop a strategy of work (2)
select gene products to be targeted by shRNA; (3) select shRNA clones; (4)
establish PCR for targeted genes; (5) perform shRNA knockdown approach;
(6) analyze the silencing effect by RT-PCR.

2.1 shRNA bacterial glycerol stocks

Fig. 2. Map for the pLKO.1 lentiviral vector. It derives from pRRLSIN.cPPT.PGK/GFP/WRPE
and contains elements for efficient viral packaging and shRNA expression. These include Ψ,
the lentiviral packaging site; RRE, the Rev-responsive element; cPPT. RSV/5'LTR is a hybrid
of the Rous Sarcoma virus promoter and the HIV 5'LTR. SIN 3'LTR is the HIV 3'LTR with a
self-inactivating U3 deletion. Expression of the shRNA is driven by the human U6 promoter
(hU6). The lentiviral vector also contains the mammalian selection marker puromycin
resistance gene (PAC) under the control of the PGK promoter as a mammalian selection
marker. pUCori is the bacterial origin of replication of the plasmid, F1 ori is the single-stranded
R
phage F1 origin of replication, and Amp is the ampicillin resistance gene.

shRNA bacterial glycerol stocks were purchased from SIGMA (Munich,
Germany) and stored in a -80℃ refrigerator. Each shRNA clone is constructed

Methods

3.1 Culturing clonal cell lines
The E. coli were inoculated onto freshly prepared Luria-Bertani (LB) ampicillin
medium plate by using a sterile loop. The plates were incubated into a
humidified atmosphere for 15-20 hours at 37℃.
A single E. coli colony was isolated from the plate using autoclaved tip to 5ml
polypropylene round-bottom tube, which contained 1.5ml LB medium and
1.5µl ampicillin. E. coli colony was incubated at 37℃ with constant shaking
(200-250 rpm) overnight.

3.2 Purification and sequencing of plasmid DNA
Plasmid DNA was purified by NucleoSpin® Plasmid Mini Kit according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. With the NucleoSpin plasmid method, the pelleted
bacteria were resuspended (buffer A1) and plasmid DNA was liberated from
the E. coli host cells by SDS/alkaline lysis (buffer A2). The resulting lysate
was neutralized and appropriate conditions for binding of plasmid DNA to the
silica membrane of the NucleoSpin Plasmid QuickPure column by buffer A3
were created. SDS precipitated and cell debris was then pelleted by a
centrifugation step, the supernatant was loaded onto the column.
Contaminations

like

salts,

metabolites,

nucleases

and

soluble

macromolecular cellular components were removed by only a single washing
step with buffer AQ. Pure plasmid DNA was finally eluted under low ionic
strength conditions with slightly alkaline buffer AE (5mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5).
To determine the nucleotide order in the plasmid, the sequence was analyzed

38

3. Methods

using the Big Dye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and the ABI PRISM
310 Genetic Analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This
method labeled the terminators instead of labeling the primer in the method of
Sanger dideoxy chain termination. The major advantage of this approach is
that the complete sequencing set can be performed in a single reaction, rather
than four different reactions needed in the labeled-primer approach. The dye
terminator

method

was

accomplished

by

labeling

each

of

the

dideoxynucleotide chain-terminators with a separate fluorescent dye, which
fluoresced at a different wavelength and was therefore easier to perform
compared to the Sanger’s method.

3.2.1 Mini-purification of plasmid DNA

3.2.1.1 Cultivate and harvest bacterial cells
Using 1.5ml of a saturated E. coli LB culture, cells were pelleted in a standard
benchtop microcentrifuge for 30s at 11000x g. The supernatant was discarded
carefully. As much of the supernatant as possible should be removed.
3.2.1.2 Cell lysis
250µl buffer A1 was added. The cell pellet was resuspended by vigorous
vortexing. No cell clumps should remain in the suspension before the addition
of buffer A2.
250µl buffer A2 was added. Mix the pellet gently by inverting the tube 6-8
times. Do not vortex. The pellet was incubated at room temperature for a
maximum of 5min. Do not vortex because chromosomal DNA might be
released by mechanical shearing.
300µl buffer A3 was added. Mix gently by inverting the tube 6-8 times. Do not
vortex.

3. Methods

39

3.2.1.3 Clarification of lysate
The lysate was centrifuged for 5min at 11000x g at room temperature.
3.2.1.4 Bind DNA
NucleoSpin Plasmid QuickPure column was placed in a 2ml collecting tube
and the supernatant was loaded from the last step onto the column. The
supernatant was centrifuged for 1min at 11000x g. The flow-through was
discarded.
3.2.1.5 Wash silica membrane
NucleoSpin Plasmid QuickPure column was placed back into the 2ml
collecting tube and 450µl buffer AQ was added. The column was centrifuged
for 3min at 11000x g. The flow-through was discarded.
3.2.1.6 Dry silica membrane
The drying of the NucleoSpin Plasmid QuickPure column was performed by
the 3min centrifugation in the last step.
3.2.1.7 Elute and detect highly pure DNA
The column was place in a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube and 50µl buffer AE was
added. The column was incubated 1min at room temperature and was
centrifuged for 1min at 11000x g.
Plasmid yield was detected by using 4µl aliquotes plus 46µl HPLC-H2O by UV
spectrophotometry with an A260/280 ratio approaching 2.0 that indicates the
purity of the plasmid.

3.2.2 Sequencing PCR
DNA sequencing reaction was run by using a PTC-200 Peltier thermal cycler
in a total volume of 20µl including 4µl Big Dye Terminator v1.1 Ready

3. Methods

40

Reaction Mix; 2µl Big Dye Sequencing v1.1 buffer; 1µl primer LKO.1
(5’-GACTATCATATGCTTACCGT-3’) (5pmol/µl); 150-300ng DNA; HPLC- H2O,
which plus the volume of DNA equals to 13µl. The sequencing reaction steps
were as follows: 4min at 94℃, 24 cycles of 94℃ for 30s, 50℃ for 1min and
60℃ for 1min, with a final 72℃ step for 5min.

3.2.3 Clean-up of sequencing-PCR products
Clean-up of sequencing reaction products was performed by using the
NucleoSEQ Kit. (1) Dried gel resin in NucleoSEQ column was spin down 30s
at 3500rpm; (2)600µl HPLC- H2O was added and vortexed to hydrate the gel
matrix. Air bubbles was removed by vortexing or tapping the column; (3) gel
matrix was incubated at 4℃ or room temperature at least 30min; (4) the
settled gel matrix was resuspended by inverting of vortexing the spin column
several times. Air bubbles should not be visible; (6) the column was cut
closure at the bottom and spun 2min at 3500rpm, collection vial was
discarded; (7) column was place onto an Eppendorf tube; (8)20µl Seq-PCR
products were carefully loaded drop-wise onto the center of the gel resin,; (9)
the sample was eluted by centrifuging the column for 5min at 3500rpm, the
column was discarded, sample was dried or used directly.

3.2.4 Ethanol precipitation
Ethanol precipitation steps of the sequencing reaction products were as
follows: (1) 3µl 3M Na-Acetate and 80µl 100％ ethanol was added, vortexed
briefly and incubated 15min at room temperature; (2) the products were spun
20min at 13000rpm, supernatant was discarded and then 250µl 70％ ethanol
was added and vortexed briefly; (3) the products were spun 10min at
13000rpm, supernatant was spun as above and the DNA pellet was dried for
at least 10min; (4) 15µl TSR was added to the dried pellet; (5) the DNA was
denatured in PTC-200 Peltier thermal cycler at 94℃ for 4min and then the
products was placed on ice for 3min and was spun about 10s at 6000rpm.

3. Methods

41

3.2.5 Sequencing samples in sequencer
The samples were placed in the ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer and the
analysis of the sequencing reaction was performed according to the
manufacturer.

3.2.6 Clarify the target gene
The sequences were checked at: www.sigma-aldrich.com/missionsearch
using RefSeq accession numbers to identify the correct sequence of the
insert of every shRNA clone.

3.2.7 Midi-purification of plasmid DNA
Validated plasmid DNA was purified by HiSpeed Plasmid Midi and Maxi Kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions for further transfection. The Midi
plasmid purification protocols were based on a modified alkaline lysis
procedure, followed by binding of plasmid DNA to Anion-Exchange Resin
under appropriate low-salt and pH conditions. RNA, proteins, dyes, and
low-molecular-weight impurities were removed by a medium-salt wash.
Plasmid DNA was eluted in a high salt buffer and then concentrated and
desalted by isopropanol precipitation.
3.2.7.1 Cultivate and harvest bacterial cells
A single colony was picked from a freshly streaked selective LB plate and
used to inoculate a starter culture of 2-5 ml LB medium containing the
selective antibiotic (ampicillin). The culture was incubated for approx. 8 h at
37°C with vigorous shaking (300 rpm). Then the starter culture was diluted
1/500 to 1/1000 into 50 ml selective LB medium and grown at 37°C for 12-16h
with vigorous shaking (300 rpm). The culture should reach a cell density of
approximately 3-4 x 109 cells per milliliter, which typically corresponds to a
pellet wet weight of approximately 3g/liter. The bacterial cells were harvested
by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. All traces of supernatant were
removed by inverting the open centrifuge tube until all medium has been

3. Methods

42

drained.
3.2.7.2 Cell lysis
The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 6ml buffer P1, to which RNase A was
added. For efficient lysis to occur it was important to use a vessel that was
large enough to allow complete mixing of the lysis buffers. The bacteria
should be resuspended completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down until
no cell clumps remain. 6 ml or Buffer P2 was added, mixed thoroughly by
vigorously inverting the sealed tube 4-6 times and incubated at room
temperature for 5 min. The mixture should not be vortexed, as this would
result in shearing of genomic DNA. The lysate should appear viscous. The
lysis reaction should not proceed for more than 5 min.
During the incubation the QIAfilter Cartridge was prepared: The cap was
screwed onto the outlet nozzle of the QIAfilter Midi Cartridge. The QIAfilter
Cartridge was placed into a convenient tube.
3.2.7.3 Clarification of lysate
6 ml or chilled Buffer P3 was added to the lysate, mixed immediately and
thoroughly by vigorously inverting the tube 4-6 times. The lysate should not be
incubated on ice.
After addition of Buffer P3, a fluffy white precipitate containing genomic DNA,
proteins, cell debris, and KDS became visible. The buffers must be mixed
completely. If the mixture appeared still viscous and brownish, more mixing
was required to completely neutralize the solution. It was important to transfer
the lysate into the QIAfilter Cartridge immediately in order to prevent later
disruption of the precipitate layer. The lysate was incubated at room
temperature for 10 min. This 10 min incubation at room temperature was
essential for optimal performance of the QIAfilter Cartridge. Do not agitate the
QIAfilter Cartridge during this time. A precipitate containing proteins, genomic
DNA, and detergent would float and form a layer on top of the solution. This

3. Methods

43

ensured convenient filtration without clogging.
A HiSpeed Midi or Tip was equilibrated by applying 4 ml Buffer QBT and the
column was allowed to empty by gravity flow. Flow of buffer will begin
automatically by reduction in surface tension due to the presence of detergent
in the equilibration buffer. The HiSpeed Tip was allowed to drain completely.
The cap was removed from the QIAfilter outlet nozzle. The plunger was gently
inserted into the QIAfilter Midi Cartridge and the cell lysate was filtered into
the previously equilibrated HiSpeed Tip until all of the lysate has passed
through the QIAfilter Cartridge, but did not apply extreme force. Approximately
15 ml of the lysate was generally recovered after filtration.

3.2.7.4 Bind and wash DNA
The cleared lysate was allowed to enter the resin by gravity flow. The
HiSpeed Midi Tip was washed with 20 ml or Buffer QC. Buffer QC was
allowed to move through the HiSpeed Tip by gravity flow.
3.2.7.5 Elute and precipitate DNA
The DNA was eluted by 5 ml or Buffer QF. The eluate was collected in a 15ml
conical tube. The DNA was precipitated by adding 3.5 ml room temperature
isopropanol to the eluted DNA and was mixed and incubated at room
temperature for 5 min. All solutions should be at room temperature in order to
minimize salt precipitation. During the incubation the plunger was removed
from a 20 ml syringe and the QIAprecipitator Midi Module was attached onto
the outlet nozzle. The QIAprecipitator was placed over a waste bottle, the
eluate/isopropanol mixture was transfered into the 20 ml syringe, and the
plunger was inserted. The eluate/isopropanol mixture was filtered through the
QIAprecipitator using constant pressure. The QIAprecipitator was removed
from the 20 ml and the plunger was pulled out. The QIAprecipitator was
reattached and 2 ml 70% ethanol was added to the syringe. The DNA was
washed by inserting the plunger and pressing the ethanol through the

3. Methods

44

QIAprecipitator using constant pressure. Then the QIAprecipitator was
removed from the 20 ml syringe and the plunger was pulled out. The
QIAprecipitator was attached to the 20 ml syringe again, the plunger was
inserted, and the membrane was dried by pressing air through the
QIAprecipitator quickly and forcefully. Repeat this step.
The outlet nozzle of the QIAprecipitator was dried with absorbent paper to
prevent ethanol carryover. The plunger was removed from a new 5 ml syringe
and the QIAprecipitator was attached onto the outlet nozzle. The outlet of the
QIAprecipitator was held over a 1.5 ml collection tube. 1 ml of Buffer TE was
added to the 5 ml syringe. The plunger was inserted and the DNA was eluted
into the collection tube using constant pressure.
Plasmid yield was detected by using 4µl probes plus 46µl HPLC-H2O by UV
spectrophotometry with A260/280 ratio, indicating the purity of plasmid.

3.3 Culture 293FT cells
3.3.1 Thawing and culture cells
293FT cells were stored in liquid nitrogen and were thawed quickly in a 37℃
water bath. Just before the cells were completely thawed, the outside of the
vial was decontaminated with 70% ethanol. Subsequently, the cells were
transfered to a sterile 15ml tube containing PBS. The cells were briefly
centrifuged at 150-200x g and resuspended in 2ml complete medium without
antibiotic. Then cells were transferred to T-75cm2 flask containing 10ml
prewarmed, complete medium. The cells were incubated overnight at 37℃
for allowing the cells to attach to the bottom of the flask. The next day, the
medium was aspirated off and was replaced with fresh, complete medium,
which was replaced every 2-3 days. Since L-glutamine slowly decays over
time, the complete medium needs to be supplemented with 2mM L-glutamine.

3. Methods

45

This ensured that the concentration of L-glutamine in complete medium will
not get too low over time due to its slow degradation.

3.3.2 Subculturing cells
At about 80-90％ confluence, cell density should be above 5 x 105, cells were
subcultured after exposure to trypsin/EDTA. Viability and cell density was
determined by trypan blue stain (0.4%).
3.3.2.1 Determining viability and cell density
The surface of hemocytometer chamber and cover lip were cleaned with 70%
ethanol carefully. The coverlip was breathed to humidify and was placed on
the chamber plate, so called Newton rings should become visible and cover
lip needs to fit well. 50µl cells was incubated in the 50µl 0.4% trypan blue
solution (final concentration: 0.2%) for 1-2minutes. 10µl of this suspension
was pipetted to the chamber and the chamber was placed under the phase
contrast microscope, 10x objective focus was used. Living cells were counted
in 4 large squares and the viability was calculated: Cells/ml = (sum of living
cells/ numbers of large squares) x 104x 2. Cells viability should be at least
95% for healthy log-phase cultures.
3.3.2.2 Subculturing cells
All medium was removed from the flask and the cells were washed once with
10ml PBS to remove excess medium and serum. 2ml of trypsin/EDTA solution
was added to the monolayer and incubated 1-5min at room temperature until
cells detach. The cells were checked under a microscope and it was
confirmed that most of cells have detached. Viable and total cells were
determined and cells were seeded at the density 2-5x 104 /cm2.

3.4 RNAi transfection by Lipofectamine 2000
Before transfection, the subcultured cells should be at passage 10 or lower.

46

3. Methods

Complexes were preparered using a DNA (µg) to Lipofectamine™ 2000 (µl)
ratio of 1:2 to 1:3 for cell lines.
One day before transfection, 0.5-2x 105 cells in 2ml of growth medium without
antibiotics were plated per 6-well plate so that cells will be 90-95% confluent
at the time of transfection. For each transfection sample, complexes were
prepared as follows: Dilute 4µg DNA in 250µl DMEM (high glucose) without
serum. Mix gently. Mix Lipofectamine™ 2000 gently before use, then dilute it
10µl in 250µl DMEM (high glucose). Incubate for 5 minutes at room
temperature. After the 5 minute incubation, combine the diluted DNA with
diluted Lipofectamine™ 2000 (total volume = 500µl). Mix gently and incubate
for 20 minutes at room temperature (solution may appear cloudy). Add the
500µl of complexes to each well containing cells and medium. Mix gently by
rocking the plate back and forth. Incubate cells at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for
18-48 hours prior to testing for transgene expression.
The TurboGFP Control Vector was used as a positive transfection control and
untreated cells, that provided a reference point for comparing all other
samples, were employed as negative control.

3. Methods

One of the most important aspects in the isolation of RNA is to prevent the
degradation of RNA during the isolation procedure. With the NucleoSpin RNA
methods, cells are lysed by incubation in a solution containing large amounts
of chaotropic ions. This lysis buffer immediately inactivated RNases – which
are present in virtually all biological materials – and created appropriate
binding conditions which favored the adsorption of RNA to the silica
membrane. Contaminating DNA, which was also bound to the silica
membrane, was removed by an rDNase solution which was directly applied
onto the silica membrane during the preparation. Simple washing steps with
two different buffers removed salts, metabolites and macromolecular cellular
components. Pure RNA was finally eluted under low ionic strength conditions
with RNase-free water. The purity of RNA was analyzed by using 2µl probes
plus 48µl HPLC-H2O by UV spectrophotometry.
350µl buffer RA1 and 3.5µl β-mercaptoethanol were added to the cell pellet or
to ground tissue and vortexed vigorously. Viscosity and the lysate were
removed and cleared by filtration through NucleoSpin Filter units:
NucleoSpin® Filter units (violet ring) were placed in a collecting tube, the
mixture and centrifuge were applied for 1 min at 11,000 x g. In case of visible
pellet formation (depending on sample amount and nature) the supernatant
was transferred without any formed pellet to a new 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. The
Filter unit was discarded and 350µl ethanol (70%) was added to the
homogenized lysate and mixed by pipetting up and down (5 times). For each
preparation, one NucleoSpin RNA II column (light blue ring) was placed in a 2
ml centrifuge tube. Lysate was pipetted up and down 2-3 times and the lysate
was loaded to the column and centrifuged for 30 s at 11,000x g. The column
then was placed in a new collecting tube. 350µl MDB (Membrane Desalting
Buffer) was added and centrifuged at 11,000 x g for 1 min to dry the
membrane. 95µl DNase reaction mixture was applied directly onto the center
of the silica membrane of the column and incubated at room temperature for
15 min. 200µl buffer RA2 was added to the NucleoSpin RNA II column and

3. Methods

48

centrifuged for 30 s at 11,000x g. The column was then placed into a new
collecting tube. 600µl buffer RA3 was added to the column centrifuged for 30s
at 11,000 x g. Flowthrough was discarded and the column was placed back
into the collecting tube. 250 µl buffer RA3 was added to the column and
centrifuged for 2 min at 11,000 x g to dry the membrane completely. The
column was then placed into a nucleasefree 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. The
RNA was eluted in 60µl RNase-free H2O and centrifuged at 11,000 x g for 1
min.

3.5.2 cDNA synthesis
cDNA was synthesized from identical amounts of 1µg total RNA using
BioScript reverse transcriptase and random hexamers according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
Appropriate volume of HPLC- H2O was pipetted into autoclaved 1.5ml
Eppendorf tubes. RNA-suspension was added, RNA plus water should be
exactly 11µl. 1µl (1µg/µl) random hexamers were added per reaction. The
tubes should be placed into a heating block at 70℃ for 5min then on ice for
5min, spun briefly. For 1 sample, 4µl 5x reaction buffer, 1µl 10mM dNTPs,
2.75µl HPLC- H2O, 0.25µl 200U/µl BioScript reverse transcriptase were
added respectively. Samples were placed at room temperature for 10min then
in a heating block at 42℃ for 60min then place at 70℃ for 10min and
centrifuged briefly and 30µl HPLC- H2O was added.

3.5.3 PCR
PCR reactions were run in a volume of 30µl containing 1µl cDNA for the
house keeping gene eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF 1ɑ)
applying 35-45 amplification cycles (Schütze et al., 2005b). For each sample,
the PCR reaction master mix consisted of 0.5 units BIOTAQ DNA polymerase,
1mM NH4 reaction buffer with 1.7mM MgCl2, 0.3mM dNTPs, 5pmol forward

49

3. Methods

and 5pmol reverse primer plus 1µl cDNA. PCR reaction steps were as follows:
3min at 94℃, 35-45cycles of 94℃ for 30s, 48-60℃ for 1min and 72℃ for 1min,
with a final 72℃ step for 5min.

3.6 Gel electrophoresis and densitometry
3.6.1 Gel electrophoresis
The appropriate percent content of agarose in the gel depends on the size of
the PCR-products that were to be separated in gel electrophoresis.
Appropriate amount of agarose was weighted in Erlenmeyer flask and 100ml
or 50ml of 0.5% TBE-buffer was added. Agarose was then heated in a
microwave

oven

until

the

agarose

was

completely

dissolved.

5µl

ethidiumbromide per 100ml was added to gel solution. The gel was poured
and a comb was inserted. After 30min, when the gel hardened it was placed
into an electrophoresis chamber and the comb was removed.
Then 1.5µl of 10% DNA-loading-dye and 10µl PCR-products were placed into
an eppendorf tube. 10µl of sample was pipetted into each slot of the gel and
5µl DNA-ladder was added into one of the slot. Gel running conditions: 145V
for about 45min.
PCR-bands were monitored and semiquantitatively analyzed using the LTF
BioCaptMW software (LTF, Wasserburg, Germany).

3.6.2 Densitometry
Densitometry is the quantitative measurement of optical density in
light-sensitive materials, such as photographic film, due to exposure to light.
Optical density is a result of the darkness of a developed picture and can be
expressed absolutely as the number of dark spots (i.e., silver nitrate grains in
developed films) in a given area.

4.1 Strategy of work
The goal of the project was to establish knock down of mRNA in human
mesenchymal stem cells. Since these cells are difficult to transfect, a viral
approach is needed to achieve sufficient expression of e. g. shRNA in a high
percentage of cells to allow for an efficient silencing of corresponding mRNAs.
For this purpose for every gene product of interest, a number of shRNA
clones have to be tested to detect an individual shRNA with sufficient efficacy.
Lentiviral systems for shRNA approaches have recently become available.
The principal advantage of the lentiviral system is that it allows gene silencing
in nondividing cells and therefore expands the usefulness of the RNAi-based
gene silencing system. Lentivirus-delivered shRNAs are capable of specific,
highly stable and functional silencing of gene expression in a variety of cell
types.
The MISSION-consortium (in association with Sigma Inc.) was established
with the goal to silence every human and mouse mRNA by a lentiviral shRNA
strategy and to provide the individual clones to the academic community at a
reduced rate. It was claimed that MISSION™ shRNAs are expressed within
the cell from a plasmid and serve as potent gene silencing agents that allow
for long-term gene knockdown. The plasmids expressing the shRNAs can be
used either directly for transfection to achieve transient gene knock-down or
as lentiviral particles after transfection of 293 cells along with packaging and
envelope plasmids for long-term experiments by integration into the host
genome. Features of the MISSION shRNA-clones are: (1) easy - avoid
handling of RNAs and Dicer treatment; (2) comprehensive, average of 3-5
shRNA constructs per target gene; (3) economical, vector-based system
provides a renewable resource compared to siRNA; (4) flexible, transient or

52

4. Results

stable silencing (puromycin selection) for long term expression or phenotypic
studies; (5) solutions, lentiviral system for transduction of difficult cell lines
(non-dividing cells and primary cells); (6) quality, all clones are sequence
verified; (7) controls provides in parallel (GFP, scrambled shRNA etc).
Since the viral transfection of MSCs is a time consuming process that involves
transfection of 293 FT cells plus transduction of target cells, for this thesis the
following approach was chosen: genes of interest were checked for
expression in 293FT cells by RT-PCR. These gene products can be silenced
in 293FT cells simply by transfection of shRNA clones and efficacy was
subsequently tested by RT-PCR. Beyond this thesis then the project can
proceed with effective clones to transduce primary MSCs with individual
shRNA clones identified as effective silencing tool in this thesis.

osteoblasts, respectively.
From the homepage of the MISSION at the time of beginning of the project we

was from the previously mentioned ranking list and according to data
available in the literature as well as the availability of shRNA clones from the

53

MISSION project. These genes can all be expressed in 293T cells according
to the literature in the homepage of the MISSION. Each gene is represented
by a target set that consists of an average of 4-5 individual constructs or
clones targeting different regions of the gene sequence.

Totally, eight shRNA clone sets that consisted of 4-5 individual clones with

From altogether 39 clone constructs received, 26 plasmids with clones hairpin
constructs were gained (Fig.3; Table 2). Apart from one clone set, the
remaining 7 clone sets are represented by at least 2 distinct shRNA clones,
respectively.
After checking the sequences, we knew that these 26 constructs hairpin
sequences were targeted to 8 different mRNAs respectively, (coding for 7
known proteins and 1 hypothetical protein). Most regions that the shRNA
targeted were in the CDS, except 4 hairpin sequences that targeted in the
3’-UTR.

4.4 RT-PCR of genes of interest in 293FT cells
In order to know whether these genes of interest are expressed in 293FT cells,
and therefore could be targeted by shRNA transfections, we used RNA
isolated from 293FT cells and primers showed in table 1 to perform RT-PCR.
It was confirmed that all these genes of interest were expressed in 293FT
cells.

Fig 4. Examples of some genes of interest were expressed in 293FT cells. From left to right,
the bands represent SERPINE1, SNF1LK2, PDE4b, DDIT4, BIRC3, PLCB4, ID4, EPHA2,
DDAH1, RGS4, COFEB.

4.5 RNAi transfection by Lipofactamine 2000
Before transfection, the 293FT cells should reach 90-95% confluence.
Otherwise, the cells would die because Lipofectamine is toxic. We found that
the cells grew slowly when adding the Lipofactamine 2000 in transfections.
Using a plasmid encoding the green fluorescent protein the transfection
efficacy was controlled over time to establish the appropriate transfection
conditions according to length of treatment and concentration of lipofectamine
and plasmid DNA for the 293 cells.
From several experiments the following conditions were established to
achieve optimal transfection efficacy as is presented in fig. 4. 4µg DNA and
10µl Lipofectamine™ 2000 were diluted in 250µl DMEM (high glucose)
without serum, respectively. After the 5 minute incubation, combine the
diluted DNA with diluted Lipofectamine™ 2000 (total volume = 500µl). Mix
gently and incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature. 500µl of complexes
were added to each sample. Cells were incubated at 37°C in a CO2 incubator
for 18-48 hours prior to testing for transgene expression. After 1 day of
transfection, there was a little cells turning green in the positive control well

where there was Turbo-GFP vector. While after 2 days of transfection, the
cells turn green sharply (Fig. 5).

Discussion

The goal of this project is to establish knock down of mRNAs in human
mesenchymal stem cells. Genes to be targeted stem from a project that
identified candidate genes for controlling transdifferentiation events in
adipogenic and osteogenic transdifferentiation processes. Using a list of the
top 40 ranked gene products 8 gene targets were selected for gene silencing.
Since the viral transfection of MSCs is a time consuming process, genes of
interest were checked for expression in 293FT cells by RT-PCR. These gene
products can be silenced in 293FT cells simply by transfection of shRNA
clones. The efficacy of this approach was tested by RT-PCR.

5.1 Turbo-GFP is a useful tool for in vivo imaging

5.1.1 Characteristics of GFPs
Four decades ago, GFP was discovered in the Pacific Northwest jellyfish
Aequorea victoria (Johnson et al, 1962) where it acts as a secondary emitter
in a bioluminescent system based on the Ca2+-dependent photoprotein
aequorin. But it was not until 1994, that this protein attracted attention after
cloning and successful heterologous expression of the gfp gene (GenBank
accession no. U17997) (Chalfie et al, 1994). GFP and its mutants soon
became popular tools for cell and molecular biology and, during the past few
years, the great spectral and phylogenetic diversity of GFP-like proteins has
been characterized in marine organisms; furthermore, several useful mutant
variants of GFPs have been generated. Together with engineered mutant
variants, FPs are a family of homologous 25-30 kDa polypeptides and now
available for the entire visible spectrum: from 450 to 650 nm. A novel
green-FP, the-non-aggregating mutant of fast maturating Copepoda GFP –
named TurboGFP and the monomeric mutant mAG1 (Azami Green)

5. Discussion

60

(Karasawa et al, 2003) of Galaxeidae coral GFP have also been produced
recently.

5.1.2 Applications of GFPs
FPs are widely used as noninvasive probes to study different biological
models from individual cells to whole organisms. The use of FPs enables the
tracking of every step of the protein of interest: expression, localization,
movement, interaction and activity in the cell, tissue or organism. The main
applications of FPs are: visualization of target-gene promoter up- and
down-regulation, protein labeling, detection of protein–protein interactions,
tracking protein movement and monitoring cellular parameters using
FP-based fluorescent sensors.
5.1.2.1 Monitoring of gene expression
The gene encoding a FP is cloned under the control of the target promoter,
whereby activity of the promoter can be monitored by the magnitude of the
fluorescent signal. Although this approach has a reduced sensitivity
compared with enzyme-based assays, it has certain advantages and a much
wider range of applications when using specially designed FP variants. The
oligomeric state of an FP is important when applied to protein labeling but it
does not have a negative effect on monitoring of promoter activity. Therefore,
many new FPs are suitable for these applications, making it possible to detect
the activity of several different promoters with up to 4-5 distinct fluorescent
colors, simultaneously.
Moreover, FPs allow time-scale monitoring of promoter activity. The first
approach is to use destabilized FPs (Li et al, 1998) to obtain a fluorescent
signal only during the period of promoter activity. Here, fast-maturating FPs
are desirable to provide a minimal delay between the promoter activation and
fluorescent signal appearance. The second approach is to use the so-called
Timer FP, which is capable of a gradual change in fluorescence color over
time: from blue to green, and then to red (Terskikh et al, 2000); therefore

5. Discussion

61

Timer provides retrospective information about the length of time the promoter
is active.
Recently, a novel technique to detect promoter activity has been developed
using a so-called split FP. This is a FP expressed as two separate parts but
capable of reconstituting to the whole functional protein when cloned fewer
than two promoters of interest; the fluorescent signal occurs only when both
promoters are active. Moreover, by combining separate parts, each carrying
point mutations responsible for spectral shifts, one can obtain information
about the combinations of promoters of interest active in a system (Zhang et
al, 2004).
5.1.2.2 Protein labeling
The most widely used FP application is probably protein tagging, achieved by
cloning a FP in frame with the target protein at either its N- or C-terminus.
Numerous experiments with GFP mutants have demonstrated that most
fusion proteins created this way are fully functional; however, in each
particular case, the researcher must determine whether the function of the
FP-tagged protein remains natural. An oligomeric state becomes crucial when
fusing GFP-like proteins to a protein of interest and, in most cases, attempts
to use tetrameric FPs to label cellular proteins result in aggregation of the
chimera and disturbance to the target protein function and localization.
Although several other solutions have been proposed to avoid this
complication, the answer lies in developing monomeric FPs with the desired
spectral characteristics (Ando et al, 2004).
5.1.2.3 Protein mobility
Over the past few years, considerable progress has been made in developing
the so-called photoactivatable FPs. These proteins are capable of a
many-fold increase in fluorescence intensity at certain excitation/emission
wavelengths, in response to irradiation with specific light. This property can be
used to ‘switch-on’ a fluorescent signal, using a beam of focused light, and

62

5. Discussion

then track the movement of labeled cells, organelles or individual proteins.
Until recently, photobleaching techniques, such as fluorescence recovery
after photobleaching (FRAP), fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP),
flurescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET) were the major tools to study protein mobility (Schmid
and Neumeier, 2005). Photoactivatable FPs provide a more precise, direct
and less damaging way to study movement of proteins.
In our research, the Turbo-GFP, an improved variant of the green fluorescent
protein copGFP cloned from the copepoda Pontellina plumata, control vector
is an 8347 base pair lentiviral plasmid vector that contains a gene encoding
Turbo-GFP, under the control of the CMV promoter. It is useful as a positive
transfection control in experiments using the shRNA clones.

5.2 PLC-β4 is a multifunction protein
Phospholipase C (PLC) constitutes a large family of mammalian hydrolytic
phosphodiesterase enzymes that participate in phosphatidylinositol (PIP2)
metabolism and lipid signaling pathways in a calcium dependent manner.
Currently, the superfamily consists of six sub-families comprising a total of 13
separate isoforms that differ in their mode of activation, catalytic regulation,
cellular localization, membrane binding avidity, and tissue distribution. All are
capable of catalyzing the hydrolysis of PIP2 into two important second
messenger molecules, which go on to alter cell responses such as
proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, cytoskeleton remodeling, vesicular
trafficking,

ion

channel

conductance,

endocrine

function

and

neurotransmission (Wu et al., 2000; Rhee, 2001).
Recently, it was revealed that PLC is normally located in the inner leaflet of
the plasma membrane, where it can regulate transmembrane proteins,
including ion channels and transporters (Ma and Eaton, 2005). However, it
was reported that nuclear phosphoinositides are involved in cell growth and

5. Discussion

63

differentiation and it is becoming increasingly clear that in the nucleus
polyphosphoinositides may act by themselves to influence pre-mRNA splicing
and chromatin structure (Martelli et al., 2004).

5.2.1 Structure of PLC-β4
The molecular size of PLC-β isozymes is in the range of 120-150 kDa. The
amino acid sequences of PLC isozymes are relatively nonconserved with the
exception of two regions, known as the X and Y domains, which form the
catalytic core (Rhee et al, 1997). In domain organization, PLC-β4 posses X
and Y domains in the form of a distorted triose phosphate isomerase (TIM)
barrel with a highly disordered, charged, and flexible intervening linker region.
Meanwhile, PLC-β4 posses 4 EF hand domains, and a single C2 domain that
flank the X and Y catalytic core and presents a long C-terminal extension
immediately subunits, which may also play a role in nuclear localization.

5.2.2 Activation of PLC-β4 by Gɑq subunits
PLC-β4 function as effector enzymes for receptors belonging to the rhodopsin
superfamily of transmembrane proteins that contain seven transmembrane
spanning (heptahelical) segments (Ji et al, 1998). They are activated by a
wide range of stimuli, from photons and tiny odorant molecules, to full-sized
proteins and require specific combinations of Gɑ subunits to couple to their
effectors. In the standard G protein model of PLC-β4 activation, binding of
agonist triggers receptor-catalyzed exchange of GTP for bound GDP on the ɑ
-component of the heterotrimer. The GTP-charged subunit then dissociates in
the plane of the membrane, increasing its catalytic activity and thereby
amplifying the initial receptor stimulus.
PLC-β4 was first isolated from cerebellum and retina (Min et al, 1993; Jiang et
al, 1994). Its mRNA is highly concentrated in cerebellar Purkinje and granule
cells, the median geniculate body, whose axons terminate in the auditory
cortex, and the lateral geniculate nucleus, where most retinal axons terminate

5. Discussion

in a visuotopic representation of each half of the visual field. Because PLC-β4
is widely distributed on the cell membrane and nucleus and highly
concentrated in neuron tissues, which composed most of 293FT cells, it
seems that this may be why PLC-β4 is easily silenced in our experiment.

5.3 Possible reasons for low efficiency of RNAi
In MISSION technical bulletin, it was claimed that each clone set consists of
3-5 constructs that have been designed against each target gene using a
proprietary algorithm and therefore, a range of knockdown efficiency, with at
least one construct from each gene set being > 70%, can be expected when
using these clones. But In this thesis, from all 26 constructs hairpin
sequences only one hairpin sequence silenced a target gene. Why is the
efficiency of RNAi low? Apart from technical reasons, there may be several
other reasons.

5.3.1 Drawbacks of shRNA
Paddison et al. (2002) showed that shRNA were somewhat less potent
silencing triggers than that were siRNAs. siRNAs homologous yielded
90-95% suppression of gene expression, whereas suppression levels
achieved with shRNAs ranged from 80-90% on average because of
mammalian cells contain several endogenous systems that were predicted to
hamper the application of RNAi. Chief among these is a dsRNA-activated
protein kinase, PKR, which effects a general suppression of translation via
phosphorylation of EIF-2α.
The mechanism of action from the shRNA constructs is not well-known. Hall
et al. (2002) discovered that a shRNA driven by the U6 promoter but with
strand reversal, such that an accessible anti-sense 3 terminus was not
available, still remarkably restrain the target gene expression. Therefore,
these shRNAs might not require primer extended amplification. Maybe gene

65

5. Discussion

silencing involving heterochromatin modification which has been found to
occur with RNAi in fission yeast (Volpe et al., 2002), could be involved. It is
also of interest that the shRNA constructs that silence gene expression
effectively in mammalian cells do not contain introns and polyadenylation
signals. Consequently, they may have to function in the nucleus or are
efficiently transported to the cytoplasm despite lacking these than ones
without in plants (Cao et al., 2005), but maybe, for other reasons.
Moreover, McIntyre and Fanning (2006) revealed that shRNA vector
construction can be disturbed by high mutation rates and ensuing sequencing
is often problematic. shRNA expression vectors are constructed by one of
three different methods. The most common method requires the synthesis,
annealing and ligation of two complementary oligonucleotides into an
expression vector. The frequency of false positives determined by sequencing
is high, about 20-40% high (Miyagishi et al, 2004). The unreliability of this
method is in part due to the difficulty in synthesizing long oligonucleotides (>
35 bases) and this method requires two long oligonucleotides then the chance
of mutation is doubled. The second strategy is a PCR approach in which a
promoter sequence serves as the template. Although it is advantageous that
only single long oligonucleotides is required, the strong secondary structure
predicted to form within this primer can lead to the amplification of false
products (Castanotto et al., 2005). The third method comprises several
techniques relating to primer extension. Each is based on the principle of a
polymerase

extending

the

3’

end

of

overlapping

oligonucleotides.

Nevertheless, this method reduces the cost of oligonucleotides and does not
need purification but may cause off-set by a high rate of polymerase-induced
mutations in both the initial extension and repeated cycling steps. In order to
reduce mutations, conducting all reactions as single-step extensions and
replacing Taq polymerase with an enzyme better able to counter the
secondary structure of the hairpin template were adopted. Another reported
strategy to alleviate sequencing difficulties is to include mismatched bases
within the shRNA stem (Yu et al., 2003).

5. Discussion

5.3.2 Target gene-specific characteristics influence
the RNAi efficiency
Target gene-specific characteristics such as the accessibility of the
corresponding target sequences to the RNAi appear to have a significant
influence on the knockdown efficacy, making certain targets easy or difficult to
knock down by using siRNA. It has been reported that low-abundant genes
are less susceptible to siRNA-mediated knockdown (Hu et al., 2004).
However, recently, Krueger et al. (2007) tested several thousand siRNAs for
target genes from various gene families and showed that target genes from
high or moderate to low expression levels were silenced equally well.
Moreover, it was revealed that the localization of siRNA target sites on the
transcript and siRNA concentration were not responsible for low silencing
capacity of siRNA (Krueger et al., 2007). The performance of siRNA showing
moderate silencing of < 70% knockdown threshold was almost unaffected by
increasing the siRNA concentration used for transfection, by changing the cell
type, or by increasing or decreasing the time point of analysis. In this thesis, at
least 3 clones per gene target were verified and some had 4 shRNA hairpin
sequences which targeted one gene product respectively, but we failed to
silence most of the target genes. This may indicate that the level of silencing
achieved was not exclusively dependent on the siRNA sequences.
In our experiment, because PLC-β4 is widely distributed in neuron tissues and
293FT cells generated by adenovirus transformation of human embryonic
kidney cells have many properties of immature neurons, suggesting that the
adenovirus was taken up and transformed a neuronal lineage cell in the
original kidney culture (Shaw et al, 2002), PLC-β4 is easy knocked down in
293FT cells by shRNA.

5.3.3 Limitations of the gene delivery system
Although chemical gene delivery method with liposomes are most efficacious

5. Discussion

67

in all gene delivery systems, this method also has some drawbacks.
5.3.3.1 Mechanism and structure of cationic lipids
Plasmid-based gene delivery systems utilize various types of synthetic gene
carriers to condense and protect plasmid DNA (pDNA) from premature
degradation during storage and transportation from the site of administration
to the site of gene expression (Mahato, 2005). Gene carriers are also used to
facilitate endosomal release, while avoiding DNA degradation in the
lysosomal compartment. Plasmid DNA is condensed into a highly organized
structure through a complex self-assembly process. Commonly utilized
synthetic gene carriers are cationic lipids, polymers and peptides that
condense pDNA by virtue of their electrostatic interactions with the anionic
phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid chain.
Commercially available cationic lipids used as liposome formulation of alone
for gene delivery include DOTMA, DOSPA (LipofectAMINE), and DOTAP.
Most cationic lipids used as transfection reagents have three parts: (1) a
hydrophobic lipid anchor group; (2) linker group, such as an ester, amide or
carbamate; and (3) a positively charged head-group, which interacts with
pDNA, leading to its condensation.
5.3.3.2 Cytotoxicity of cationic lipids
Despite early excitement, there are serious limitations in the use of most
existing cationic lipids systems, including high toxicity on repeated use and
induction of immunostimulation and complement activation. Although
PEGylation can reduce the levels of compliment activation and binding to
plasma proteins, transfection efficiencies of PEGylated cationic lipids are
significantly reduced (Han et al, 2000).
5.3.3.3 Enhanced immunostimulatory activity of nucleic acids
complexed as lipoplexes

5. Discussion

68

Intravenous administration of pentammonio lipid pcTG90:DOPE lipoplexes in
mice may cause an immune response that prevents a subsequent
administration of lipoplexes into mice after a relatively short interval (Meyer et
al, 1999). Repeated systemic gene expression can be achieved upon
readministration with a minimal time interval of 14 days between two
injections. When administered 6 days apart, subsequent gene expression is
inhibited by an initial lipoplex administration containing the pDNA but
uninhibited when free pDNA was first injected. Expression of the transgene
was monitored in the serum of animals.
There are several ways by which the immunostimulatory effects of vector
CpG motifs may be reduced (Schuele, 2000). These include methylation of
cytosine bases in these motifs, addition of neutralising sequences, elimination
of CpG motifs, immunosuppression using chemical or biological approaches,
targeting of vectors away from cells of the reticuloendothelial system, and
inhibition of endosomal acidification.

6. Summary and possible future research
6.1 Summary
Eight shRNA sets of bacterial glycerol stocks harboring sequence-verified
shRNA lentiviral plasmid vectors for human genes were employed for
validation. The aim of this project was to establish knock down of mRNAs in
human mesenchymal stem cells. Genes to be targeted stem from a project
that identified candidate genes for controlling transdifferentiation events in
adipogenic and osteogenic transdifferentiation processes. Using a list of the
top 40 ranked gene products 8 gene targets were selected for gene silencing.
Since the viral transfection of MSCs is a time consuming process, genes of
interest were checked for expression in 293FT cells by RT-PCR. These gene
products can be silenced in 293FT cells simply by transfection of shRNA
clones. Bacterial cultures were amplified in LB culture medium from the
glycerol stocks for use in purification of the shRNA plasmid DNA, which was
then transfected in 293FT cells by Lipofectamine 2000. Subsequently, after 2,
4, 6 days of transfection, RT-PCR was performed to authenticate the RNAi
efficiency. Of all 8 shRNA clone sets, 1 clone silenced the respective target
gene, PLCB4. Our results indicate that optimal knockdown at the mRNA level
was reached at 48-96 hours after transfection and the level of silencing
achieved was not exclusively dependent on the siRNA sequences. Target
gene-specific characteristics such as the accessibility of the corresponding
target sequences to the RNAi appear to have a significant influence on the
knockdown, making certain targets easy or difficult to knock down.
dsRNA-activated protein kinase, PKR, which effects a general suppression of
translation via phosphorylation of EIF-2α, and cytotoxicity and enhanced
immunostimulatory activity of nucleic acids complexed as lipoplexes hamper
the application of RNAi. According to the MISSION technical bulletin, a range
of knockdown efficiency, with at least one construct from each gene set being
>70%, can be expected when using these clones. But In this thesis, from all

6. Summary and possible future research

70

26 constructs hairpin sequences only one hairpin sequence silenced a target
gene.

6.2 Possible future research

6.2.1 Viral delivery
Due to their intrinsic mechanism for gene transduction, viruses readily
function as vectors in a cost-effective and delivery-efficient way.
Lentiviruses, a subclass of retroviruses, have emerged as appealing vectors
for in vivo application and are widely used for proof of concept experiments.
While safety concerns still exist, lentiviruses are free of some of the major
disadvantages hindering use of retroviruses. Namely, there is no risk of
insertional mutagenesis and lentiviruses are able to efficiently transduce
primary and non-dividing cells, thereby abolishing two major shortcomings of
retroviruses for in vivo use. Additionally, lentiviruses can accommodate large
amounts of data in their genomes, and are less immunogenic than adenoviral
vectors.
If possible, one could use lentiviral vectors to increase the efficiency of
transfection and RNAi.

6.2.2 Photoactivatable FPs
If possible, one could use photoactivatable fluorescent proteins to label the
PLCB4 or other proteins which are important in the transdifferentiation of
MSCs between adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation directions in order to
elucidate the function of proteins and reveal molecular mechanisms

Acknowledgement

Here, I would like to thank all people who have helped and inspired me during
my doctor study.
I especially want to thank my mentor, PD Dr. rer. nat Norbert Schütze, for his
constructive guidance during my research at Würzburg University. His
perpetual energy and persistent enthusiasm in research had motivated me
very much. In addition, he was always accessible and willing to help me with
my research. As a result, research life became smooth and rewarding for me.
Prof. Franz Jakob deserves special thanks as my thesis committee member.
Besides, he sets an example of first-class researcher for his rigor and passion
on both research and medical clinical work.
Furthermore, my deepest gratitude goes to my family for their unflagging love
and support throughout my life. Both my parents have dedicated their entire
professional lives to ensuring the healthy existence of people in China.
Perhaps medical professions do not create such attractive financial rewards in
China as those in western countries, but the sense of fulfillment and
satisfaction that I have witnessed my parents deriving from their professions
has left me determined to follow in their footsteps.
Last but not least, all my colleagues at the laboratory made it a convivial place
to work. In particular, I would like to thank Dr. rer. nat. Tatjana Schilling for her
scientific discussion with me, Manuela Kunz and Susanne Jatzke for their
excellent technical assistance. I acknowledge with utmost sincerity, the
friendly atmosphere I have enjoyed, with other staffs of the Orthopedic
Hospital. Despite my handicap in German language they made life much
easier.
