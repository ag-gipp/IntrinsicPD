About Ph.D. thesis of Mafalda Mucciolo:
"New insights into the pathogenic mechanisms associated with CNVs: duplication of
17p13.3, mirror effect in 16p11.2 and recessive phenotype in 22q11.22."
The work presented by Mafalda Mucciolo was performed at the Doctoral School in
Biomedicine and Immunological sciences (Siena, Italy) in the laboratory of Prof. Dr.
Alessandra Renieri.
The question she worked on was the following:
Two types of genomic disorders can be distinguished: syndromic forms where the
phenotypic features are largely invariant and fully penetrant, and those where the same
genomic rearrangement associates with a variant clinical outcomes. For the latter cases
two ideas/theories shall be tested:
a) some microdeletion syndromes could go together with activation of otherwise “recessive”
mutations of genes present only in one copy after deletion of the other allele
b) CNVs can be responsible of complex disorders in association with multiple highpenetrant alleles of low frequency.
These two theories were tested in cases 22q11.2 microdeletion, the 16p11.2
microdeletion/duplication and the 10q11.22 deletion/duplication.
As far as I understand no final conclusion could be drawn to answer the question finally.
However, in two cases with 22q11.2 microdeletion M. Mucciolo found a mutation in the
monosomic region, i.e. in the chromosome 22 without deletion, which is in support of above
mentioned idea a). Idea b) is more supported by the recently suggested ‘two-hit-model’ of
CNV – which is also discussed by M. Mucciolo. So overall, both mechanisms could
contribute here.
Overall, big parts of her results were already published or are preparation for publishing
(cumulative PhD thesis) – one even is a coauthorship in Nature.
Concerning her Ph.D.-thesis she put the data together in a form which meets international
criteria and discussed her results thoroughly. I strongly recommend that her Ph.D. thesis is
accepted.

Review of the PhD thesis: “New insights into the pathogenic mechanisms
associated with CNVs: duplication of 17p13.3, mirror effect in 16p11.2 and
recessive phenotype in 22q11.22.”
by Mafalda Mucciolo

The doctoral thesis written by Mafalda Mucciolo comprises 100 pages including a list
of references. The sections of the thesis are proportional, and follow the usual structure of the
doctoral theses.
The thesis is a carefully assembled work considering both content and format. The
studies presented in the thesis represent new approach with highly sophisticated methods and
to the study of genomic disorders; hereby, their significance is for both medical and
scientifically outstanding. The logical structure of the dissertation is easy to follow. The
clinincal descriptions are precise and detailed. The figures and tables are appropriate and
correctly reflects the information discussed through the text. The discussion and conclusion
part are also well written, the conclusions are sound.

The thesis is focusing on four key research topics:
1. Reciprocal duplication in Miller-Dieker syndrome
2. Microdeletion and microduplication in 16p11.2
3. Microdeletion and microduplication in 10q11.22
4. Microdeletion unmasking recessive phenotype
Sudy of all of them provided valuable new data on genomic rearrangements in the
background of genomic disorders which remained mostly hidden in the past due to the limited
resolution of conventional cytogenetic techniques. The research activity demonstrated in the
thesis contributed to better understanding and further delineation of the features associated
with novel microduplication syndromes as well.

Comments and questions:
1. I would suggest to insert a list of abbreviations used in the thesis, it is almost
conventional, and hels the reader.
2. There are many disorders, clinical conditions mentioned in the text. The use of
MIM numbers (if they are available) can be helpful.
3. The microdeletion and microduplication in 10q11.22 is not discussed in the
introduction. The importance of this issue is described firstly in the chapter „Aims
and outlines of the study”.
4. Rephrase the sentence: „Moreover we reported two unrelated girls carrying a
duplications of the Miller-Dieker region at 17p13.3.”
5. A typing error is on the page 30: „The overall phenotype of these two cases is
complicated by the presence of a second copy number variation ,and some
phenotypic features of our patients can be attributed either to 9p deletion or 10q
deletion.”
6. An unnecessary space occurs in the nomenclature in a sentence on page 35:
„MLPA analysis confirmed the presence of a duplication of the area containing the
RPH3AL probe on chromosome 17p13.3 in both patients, a deletion of the PAOX
probe on chromosome 10 q26.3 in Patient 1, and a deletion of the DMRT1 probe
on chromosome 9 p24.3 in Patient 2 (data not shown)”.
7. A typing error is on the top of page 60: „In a first analysis performed by arrayCGH in our cohort of patients, we identified 12 individuals sharing an overlapping
CNVs in 10q11.22 (3 deletions and 9 duplications).”
8. In the „Materials and Methods” can be read that custom available oligonucleotide
arrays were used for analyses. However, by identification of CNVs in 10q11.22
the selected and previously analysed 292 patients were negative for deletions and
duplications in10q11.22 (by array-CGH 44K). We can read on the page 60 that the
44K slides have only one probe located in the 10q11.22 region.
The question arises, why not another array was used in the examination with
specific probes representing this region better.

The thesis is based on research work published in the scientific literature which is the
evidence of the successful presentation. The articles meet the PhD requirements in their
number and level. The topic chosen by the candidate and her supervisor represent a new
wave, utilizes new generation techniques, and very exciting field of the postgenomic studies.
Apart from comments arisen by the present reviewer, the substantial work and high ranked
publications of Mafalda Mucciolo and her coworkers presented in this doctoral thesis fulfills
the requirements of a doctoral thesis and is suitable for achieving the title of “Doctor
Philosophiae”.

Dear Prof. Melegh,
I really appreciated your careful revision of my PhD thesis. I thank you very much
for your overall comments.
I am herein including a detailed response to your questions:
1.

I would suggest to insert a list of abbreviations used in the thesis, it is almost
conventional, and hels the reader.
I added a list of all the abbreviations used in the thesis.

2. There are many disorders, clinical conditions mentioned in the text. The use of
MIM numbers (if they are available) can be helpful.
Whenever possible I associated each disorder to the corrispondent MIM number.
3. The microdeletion and microduplication in 10q11.22 is not discussed in the
introduction. The importance of this issue is described firstly in the chapter
„Aims and outlines of the study”.
A new paragraph about microdeletions and microduplications in 10q11.22 has
been added in the introduction.
4. Rephrase the sentence: „Moreover we reported two unrelated girls carrying a
duplications of the Miller-Dieker region at 17p13.3.”

I changed the sentence in: „Moreover we reported two unrelated girls
carrying a duplication of the Miller-Dieker region at 17p13.3.”
5. A typing error is on the page 30: „The overall phenotype of these two cases is
complicated by the presence of a second copy number variation ,and some

phenotypic features of our patients can be attributed either to 9p deletion or 10q
deletion.”
I corrected the error on page 30: „The overall phenotype of these two cases is
complicated by the presence of a second copy number variation, and some
phenotypic features of our patients can be attributed either to 9p deletion or 10q
deletion.”
6. An unnecessary space occurs in the nomenclature in a sentence on page 35:
„MLPA analysis confirmed the presence of a duplication of the area containing
the RPH3AL probe on chromosome 17p13.3 in both patients, a deletion of the
PAOX probe on chromosome 10 q26.3 in Patient 1, and a deletion of the
DMRT1 probe on chromosome 9 p24.3 in Patient 2 (data not shown)”.
I remouved the spaces in the sentence on page 35: „MLPA analysis confirmed
the presence of a duplication of the area containing the RPH3AL probe on
chromosome 17p13.3 in both patients, a deletion of the PAOX probe on
chromosome 10q26.3 in Patient 1, and a deletion of the DMRT1 probe on
chromosome 9p24.3 in Patient 2 (data not shown)”.
7. A typing error is on the top of page 60: „In a first analysis performed by arrayCGH in our cohort of patients, we identified 12 individuals sharing an
overlapping CNVs in 10q11.22 (3 deletions and 9 duplications).”
I rephrased the sentence on page 60: „In a first analysis performed by arrayCGH in our cohort of patients, we identified 12 individuals sharing a
overlapping CNV in 10q11.22 (3 deletions and 9 duplications).”
8. In the „Materials and Methods” can be read that custom available
oligonucleotide arrays were used for analyses. However, by identification of
CNVs in 10q11.22 the selected and previously analysed 292 patients were
negative for deletions and duplications in10q11.22 (by array-CGH 44K). We
can read on the page 60 that the 44K slides have only one probe located in the
10q11.22 region. The question arises, why not another array was used in the
examination with specific probes representing this region better.
Considering the labour effort required in producing a custom array with respect
to that necessary to design specific MLPA probes for this region, we decided to
start our screening using a MLPA assay. However, taking into account the
positive results achieved until now, a custom array could be a more adequate
solution in order to better define the exact breakpoints of CNVs occurring in
10q11.22 region.

Thank you again for your suggestions.
Best regards,
Mafalda Mucciolo

1) INTRODUCTION

1.1 Historical overview

The past 50 years have seen an explosion of methodological advances in
molecular cytogenetic technology. These cytogenetic techniques added colour to the
black and white world of conventional banding. Cytogenetic analysis of Giemsastained metaphase chromosomes (Fig.1a), identifies balanced and unbalanced
structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities (Shinawi 2008). However, even
high resolution karyotypes (Yunis 1976) are enable to detect many known
microdeletion syndromes, which range from 3-5 Mb in size, and cannot detect
smaller aberrations. In the 1990s the introduction of molecular cytogenetic
techniques into the clinical laboratory setting represented a major advance in the
ability to detect known syndromes and identify chromosomal rearrangements of
unknown origin. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), which is the annealing of
fluorescently labelled locus-specific probes to their complementary sequences in the
genome, allowed for the detection of specific microdeletion syndromes (Trask 1991)
(Fig.1b1-b2). FISH technique can be used to map loci on specific chromosomes,
detect both structural chromosomal rearrangements and numerical chromosomal
abnormalities, and reveal cryptic abnormalities such as small deletions. FISH
analysis is, however a time-consuming, targeted method that requires prior
knowledge of the chromosomal region of interest and therefore interrogates one or
more candidates chromosomal loci at a time. Therefore this method is still
predominantly used when the clinical phenotype is suggestive of a particular
disorder. Several other FISH-based methods, including spectral karyotyping (SKY),
multicolour FISH (m-FISH), and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) have
proven extremely useful in the identification of unknown chromosomal material.

SKY and m-FISH rely mainly on the principal of differentially labelling each
chromosome using a unique combination of fluorochromes and are especially
beneficial for identifying the origin and content of supernumerary marker
chromosomes (SMCs) and complex chromosome rearrangements (CCRs) that
involve more than two chromosomes (Fig.1c). CGH was developed initially as a
molecular tool in tumor cytogenetic (Kallioniemi 1992). It detects genomic
imbalances and determines the map position of gains and losses of chromosomes or
chromosomal sub-regions on normal reference metaphase preparations using a small
amount of DNA. In this technique, patient and reference whole-genome DNA are
differentially labelled and co-hybridized to normal metaphase spread on glass slides.
Unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements at a resolution of ~3-10 Mb across the
whole genome can be detected by differential hybridization signals (Kirchhoff 1999)
(Fig.1d). This method is very useful for determining the origin of unknown genetic
material, such as SMCs and other unbalanced rearrangements. However, CGH does
not detect balanced rearrangements, the resolution is on the order of 5-10 Mb and
consequently many genomic disorders cannot be detected (Yunis 1976). The need to
screen the whole genome at a resolution that surpassed the existing technologies led
to the implementation of microarray based CGH. The principle is very similar to that
employed for traditional CGH, where two differentially labelled specimens are cohybridized in the presence of Cot1 DNA (Fig.2). However, the substitution of the
metaphase chromosomes with target DNAs robotically spotted immobilized onto
glass microscope slides using split metal pins or glass capillaries has significantly
enhanced the resolution and simplified the analysis procedure (Shinawi 2008).

Fig.2 Schematic representation of an array-CGH experiment. Test and reference DNA are
differentially labelled, co-precipitated and hybridised to an array. After wash procedures, the slides are
analysed through a scanner and fluorescence intensities of each probe are determined. After imaging
processing and data normalization, the log2 ratios of the probes are plotted as a function of
chromosomal position. Probes with a value of zero represent equal fluorescence intensity ratio
between sample and reference. In this representation, copy number loss shift the ratio to the left and
copy number gains shift the ratio to the right.

The higher resolution and throughput with possibilities for automation,
robustness, simplicity, high reproducibility and precise mapping of aberrations are
the most significant advantages of aCGH over cytogenetic methods. In addition,
there is no need for cell culture, making the turn around time shorter than in
cytogenetic methods. As with other clinical diagnostic methods, there are limitations
in aCGH technology. aCGH is not able to identify balanced rearrangements such as
translocations and inversions and low-level mosaicism for unbalanced numeric or
structural rearrangements.

1.2 Array – CGH Methodologies

In aCGH, equal amounts of labelled genomic DNA from a test and a
reference sample are co-hybridized to an array containing the DNA targets. Genomic
DNA of the patient and control are differentially labelled with Cyanine 3 (Cy3) and
Cyanine 5 (Cy5). The slides are scanned into image files using a microarray scanner.
The spot intensities are measured and the image files are quantified using feature
extraction software, and text file outputs from the quantitative analyses are imported
into software programs for copy number analysis (Fig.2) (Cheung 2005, Lu 2007).
The resulting ratio of the fluorescence intensities is proportional to the ratio of the
copy numbers of DNA sequences in the test and reference genomes.
Two major types of array targets are currently being utilized. Initially,
bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) were the array target of choice (Pinkel
1998). However, now oligonucleotide arrays have been adopted due to the increased
genome coverage they afford. The design of both array types was made possible by
the availability of the complete map and sequence of the human genome. The BAC
arrays may contain DNA isolated from large insert clones that range in size from
150–200 kb, spotted directly onto the array or may employ the spotting of PCR
products amplified from the BAC clones (Ylstra 2006). These arrays are generally
very sensitive and results can be directly validated with FISH using the BAC DNA
as a probe. However, production of BAC DNA is labor-intensive, and the resolution
is limited to 50–100 kb, even on a whole genome tiling path array (Ishkanian 2004).
Oligonucleotide arrays offer a flexible format with the potential for very high

8

resolution and customization. Several different platforms are available for
oligonucleotide arrays that range from 25- to 85mers in length, some of which were
adapted from genome-wide SNP-based oligonucleotide markers and others that were
created from a library of virtual probes that span the genome, and consequently can
be constructed to have extremely high resolution (Shaikh 2007). Both BAC and
oligonucleotide arrays have been used successfully to detect copy number changes in
patients with intellectual deficit (ID), multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) and
autism. A number of different array design approaches have been taken for
diagnostic purposes. A targeted array is one that contains specific regions of the
genome,

such

as

the

sub-telomeres

and

those

responsible

for

known

microdeletion/microduplication syndromes, but does not have probes that span the
whole genome (Bejjani 2005, Bejjani 2006, Shaffer 2006). A whole genome or tiling
path array offers full genome coverage with different resolution. The resolution of
array CGH is defined by two main factors: 1) the size of the nucleic acid targets and
2) the density of coverage over the genome; the smaller the size of the nucleic acid
targets and the more contiguous the targets on the native chromosome, the higher the
resolution of the array.

1.3 Clinical utility of array-CGH

The considerable gap in resolution conventional cytogenetic techniques (5-10
Mb pairs) and molecular biology techniques (base pairs) has been bridged by aCGH,
which allows the detection of genomic imbalances associated with phenotype of
unknown genetic aetiology. This new technology has driven a technical convergence
between

molecular

diagnostics

and

clinical

cytogenetics,

questioned

our

understanding of the complexity of the human genome and revolutionized the
practice of medical genetics. The use of aCGH in research and diagnostics has
resulted in the identification of many new syndromes, expanded our knowledge
about the phenotypic spectrum of existing conditions,

identified the reciprocal

products of known abnormalities, elucidated the genomic lesions in known
conditions, and ascertained the unexpected frequency of copy number variations
across the genome.

9

1.3.1 Discovering new syndromes

Deletion and duplication syndromes represent recurrent chromosomal
abnormalities

that

are

associated

with

distinct

phenotypes.

These

microdeletions/microduplications often occur between low copy repeats (LCRs) and
are commonly because of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) events
(Lupski 1998). The detection of a de novo genomic imbalance in a single patient
does not prove pathogenicity. Only the identification of similar genomic imbalances
with a recognizable phenotype can help clarify the role of these genomic changes in
causing the specific clinical features and will ultimately define a genetic syndrome.
Therefore, the application of aCGH has created a paradigm shift in genetics that has
moved the description and discovery of genetic conditions from the "phenotype-first"
approach, in which patients exhibiting similar clinical features are identified prior to
the discovery of an underlying aetiology, to a "genotype-first" approach, in which a
collection of individuals with similar copy-number imbalances can be examined for
common clinical features (Neill 2010).

1.3.2 Expanding the phenotypic spectrum of known syndrome.

“Known syndrome” are defined as syndromes exhibiting a spectrum of signs
and symptoms sufficient to encourage the clinician to proceed with a specific test in
order to confirm the clinical diagnosis. The ascertainment through whole-genome
screening of syndromic patients by array-CGH leads to the recognition of a broader
spectrum of features for already described syndromes ranging from sever phenotype
to a normal phenotype (van Bon 2009). A more complete understanding of the full
clinical spectrum of these disorders will be achieved as the use of aCGH in the clinic
becomes more prevalent and as correlations of these clinical findings with the
genomic lesions are made.

1.3.3 Identifying the reciprocal products of known abnormalities

Many the well-known microdeletion syndromes are mediated by segmental
duplications sequences (Lupski 1998). The clinical phenotypes associated with the
reciprocal microduplications of the same genomic regions are, however, less well
characterized probably because, in general, individuals with duplications tend to
have a milder phenotype than those with the complementary deletions and this
milder phenotype may not lead to clinical investigation (Van der Aa 2009; Hassed
2004; Potocki 2000). The introduction of aCGH in clinical practice has showed that
the frequency of these duplications is much higher than heretofore appreciated. As
aCGH becomes the primary method of testing individuals with even mild intellectual
deficit/developmental delay (ID/DD), the frequency of microduplications at the
common microdeletion syndrome loci will likely increase (Bejjani and Shaffer
2008).

1.3.4 Identifying the genomic lesions in known conditions

The high resolution afforded by array CGH has been used to define candidate
regions for putative genes responsible for human genetic diseases. A good example is
the discovery of a candidate gene for CHARGE syndrome (MIM#214800), a
pleiotropic disorder comprising of coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, retarded
growth and development, genital and/or urinary abnormalities, ear anomalies and
deafness. Vissers and colleagues (Vissers 2004) hybridized cell lines from two
individuals with CHARGE syndrome onto a genome-wide array with a 1Mb
resolution. The authors narrowed a candidate region for CHARGE syndrome on
8q12 based on data from two individuals, one with a ~5 Mb deletion and another
with a more complex rearrangement comprising two deletions that overlapped that of
the first deletion subject. These results allowed the authors to focus on only nine
genes in the region and detect heterozygous mutations in the gene CHD7, which was
eventually shown to be the gene for CHARGE syndrome. The high resolution of that
array was crucial in refining the critical region for this disease and in reducing the
number of candidate genes to be investigated further.

11

1.3.5 Increasing the frequency of copy number variations across the
genome

Array CGH has the ability to detect submicroscopic gains and losses of the
genome at very high resolution and is performed with the goal of identifying
pathogenic chromosomal aberrations or copy number variants (CNVs) that are
directly responsible for the observed clinical phenotype. However, CNVs have been
described in the literature that are present in phenotypically normal individuals and
in some cases occur at a high frequency in the general population (Iafrate 2004;
Sebat 2004; Sharp 2005; Redon 2006; McCarroll 2007). Some of these aberrations
are apparently benign CNVs and are usually inherited from a parent (Lee 2007). If
identical alterations are found either in one of the unaffected parents, or in
independent normal controls, they most probably have no direct phenotypic
consequences; however, low penetrance and variable expressivity of the phenotype
may complicate the analysis and genetic counseling. Currently, the publicly available
CNV databases assist in making decisions about the clinical significance of
imbalances detected by microarrays. Examples of such databases are the Database of
Genomic Variants (http://projects.tcag.ca/variation). When determined as de novo in
origin genomic imbalances are considered more likely pathological (Tyson 2005).
This can be further supported if the implicated region contains gene(s) with functions
compatible with the abnormal clinical findings or previously described patients with
a similar genomic imbalance and a similar phenotype. The de novo occurrence of
copy number alteration is, however, not an absolute evidence of its pathogenicity and
caution must be exercised for possible non paternity. Moreover genetic modifiers or
thresholds involving other copy-number alterations could play a role in the
manifestation of clinical features, or other independent mutations elsewhere in the
genome may obfuscate the interpretation of such data.

12

1.4 Copy number variations (CNVs).

CNVs can either be inherited or caused by de novo mutations of different
size. They range from 1 kb to several Mb in size and, therefore, with increasing
resolution of aCGH platforms more variations will be detected. These structural
variants show variable copy number when compared to a reference genome and
include both deletions and duplications of genomic loci (Feuk 2006). They have been
reported to encompass as much as 12% of the genome (Redon 2006) and today
several molecular mechanisms are known to be responsible for the occurrence of
CNVs within the genome (Gu 2008). The major mechanisms underlying the former
is non-allelic homologous recombination for recurrent rearrangements, and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) for non-recurrent rearrangements. NAHR can use
either region-specific low-copy-repeat (LCRs or segmental duplications) or
sometimes repetitive sequences (e.g. Alu or LINE) as homologous recombination
substrates, yielding recurrent events with clustered breakpoints (Lee 2007). When
LCRs are located on the same chromosome and in direct orientation, NAHR results
in deletion and/or duplication. Inversions result when LCRs on the same
chromosome are in opposite orientation; whilst NAHR between LCRs located in
different chromosomes result in translocation (Colnaghi 2011). However, a number
of disease-associated rearrangements are not explained readily by either the NAHR
or NHEJ recombinational mechanisms. Lee et al, proposed a new DNA replicationbased mechanism termed FoSTeS to parsimoniously explain the generation of these
complex rearrangements in the human genome. According to the FoSTeS model,
during DNA replication, the active replication fork can stall and switch templates
using complementary template microhomology to anneal and prime DNA replication
(Lee 2007). The rearrangements generated by FoSTeS can be diverse in scale, from
genomic duplications affecting megabases of the human genome to small deletions
involving a single gene or only one exon. These different sized rearrangements
implicate FoSTeS in CNVs of all sizes and in the evolution of both human genomes
and genes (Zhang 2009).

13

1.5 Copy number variation and phenotypic variability.

Is now known that any individual carries ~1000 CNV ranging from 443 bp to
1.28 Mb (Conrad et al 2010). This can lead to either too many or too few dosage
sensitive genes, which might result in phenotypic variability, complex behavioural
traits and disease susceptibility. Interestingly, CNVs have not only been associated
with disease, but also with genome evolution and adaptive traits. The AMY1 gene,
which encodes a protein that catalyses the first step in digestion of dietary starch and
glycogen, constitutes an interesting example. It has been found that the copy number
of this gene is three times higher in humans compared to chimpanzees, suggesting
that humans were favoured in the gene dosage due to a concomitant increase of
starch consumption (Perry et al,2007). However, it still remains the problem to
understand if CNV means disease and how these structural changes and gene dosage
alterations contribute on phenotypic outcomes. Actually we know that CNVs
affected specific genes or chromosomal region, can lead to susceptibility and
predisposition to certain diseases such as HIV, lupus, nephritis, pancreatitis and
psoriasis among many other phenotypes (Canales 2011). However, it has been shown
that individuals carrying the same rearrangement, for instance within an affected
family, show differences in the manifestation of the investigated phenotype.
There are several explanations for variable expressivity and clinical
heterogeneity in genomic disorders. First, the breakpoints of the events may not be
identical. Atypical deletions and duplications involving contiguous dosage-sensitive
genes within the region often explained the observed clinical variability in many
genomic disorders. Further studies demonstrated that the variability can be due to the
presence of an additional large deletion or duplication in the proband that resulted in
a sensitized genetic background and consequently a more pronounced phenotype
(Girirajan 2010). However the commonly proposed functional impact of a CNV has
been the haploinsufficiency or dosage sensitivity for one or more genes within the
genomic region, or the possibility that a recessive gene reside within the rearranged
region.

14

1.6 Reciprocal duplication of the Miller-Dieker region.

The short arm of chromosome 17 is particularly prone to submicroscopical
rearrangements due to a high density of low copy repeats. Thus, the proximal 17p
region harbours regions with microdeletion and reciprocal microduplication
syndromes, each caused by non-allelic homologous recombination: CMT1A
(Charcot–Marie–Tooth syndrome type 1A) (MIM#118220), due to a duplication at
17p11.2; HNPP (hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies)
(MIM#162500),

due

to

a

reciprocal

deletion,

Smith–Magenis

syndrome

(MIM#182290), caused by a deletion at 17p11.2; and the relatively recently
described Potocki–Lupski syndrome (MIM#610883), due to a reciprocal duplication
at 17p11.2 (Stankiewicz 2003; Potocki 2000). Deletions in the more distal region
17p13.3, including the PAFAH1B1 gene (encoding LIS1), result in the brain
malformation lissencephaly, with reduced gyration of the cerebral surface and
increased cortical thickening. Depending on the size of the deletion, the phenotype
varies from isolated lissencephaly (ILS) (MIM#607432) to Miller–Dieker syndrome
(MDS) (MIM#247200); the latter consists of severe grade ILS and additional
characteristic dysmorphic features and malformations (Dobyns 1993). Deletions in
MDS vary in size, from 0.1 to 2.9 Mb. The critical region differentiating ILS from
MDS is approximately 400 Kb, and is referred to as the ‘‘MDS telemetric critical
region’’ (Cardoso et al, 2003). Recently, 17p13.3 duplications involving the
PAFAH1B1 gene have been reported in patients with psychomotor retardation,
hypotonia and dysmorphic features without lissencephaly or gross brain
malformations (Bi et al, 2009; Roos et al, 2009; Bruno et al, 2010). The phenotype of
transgenic mice conditionally overexpressing PAFAH1B1 is indeed characterized by
decreased brain size and neuronal migration abnormalities. All the submicroscopic
rearrangements reported until now, are variable in size and have distinct breakpoints.
Bruno et al. proposed to divide 17p13.3 microduplications in two different classes:
class I duplications involving YWHAE but not PAFAH1B1 showing a phenotype
characterized by learning difficulties and/or autism with or without other congenital
abnormalities; class II duplications always harboring PAFAH1B1 that may also

15

include the genomic region encompassing the CRK and YWHAE genes, which are
associated with developmental delay, psychomotor delay and associated hypotonia.

1.7 Microdeletion and microduplication in 16p11.2

The 16p11.2 region is a well-documented hot spot for recurrent
rearrangements that are associated with autism-spectrum disorders (ASDs) and ID
(Marshall 2008; Kumar 2008; Weiss 2008). This 555 kb CNV region, which is
flanked by segmental duplications having >99% sequence identity, is presumed to
have an elevated mutation rate due to its genomic architecture (Lupski 2007). Weiss
et al. reported a recurrent microdeletion on chromosome 16p11.2 in five of 751
families with one or more cases with ASD, in three of 299 ASD patients, in five of
512 children referred for ID and/or autism (Weiss 2008). The reciprocal duplication
was found in 11 patients and in five controls. In another study, the same deletion was
detected in four of 712 autistic patients and none of 837 controls (Kumar 2008). The
latter study identified the reciprocal duplication in one autism case and two controls.
Similarly, Marshall et al. detected two de novo 16p11.2 deletions in 427 families
with autism (Marshall 2008). The authors stated that deletions and duplications of
16p11.2 carry substantial susceptibility to autism, and that the deletions appear to
account for approximately 1% of cases. Furthermore Walters et al; demonstrated
that, in addition to the cognitive deficits or behavioural abnormalities, a 16p11.2
deletion give rise to a strongly-expressed obesity phenotype in adults, with a more
variable phenotype in childhood (Walters 2011). The authors stated that the higher
frequency of 16p11.2 deletions in the cohort ascertained for both phenotypes (2.9%),
compared to cohorts ascertained for either phenotype alone (0.4% cognitive deficit
and 0.6% obesity), confirms their impact on both obesity and developmental delay,
adding to the evidence that these two phenotypes may be fundamentally interrelated.

1.8 Microdeletion and microduplication in 10q11.22
To date, interstitial deletions involving 10q11.2 have been reported in over 40
patients with variable abnormal phenotypes but also in individuals with a normal
phenotype. The only clinical features common to a majority of affected individuals

16

were ID and DD. Stankiewicz and colleagues identified 24 unrelated individuals
carrying a microdeletions at 10q11.21q11.23 ranging in size from

1.9 to

10.9 Mb.

They also identified 17 individuals with reciprocal microduplications involving
10q11.21q21.1, ranging in size from

0.3 to

12 Mb (Stankiewicz 2010). A

complex arrangement of six segmental duplication clusters have been identified in
the 10q11.21q11.23 region, labelled LCR 10q11.2A-LCR10q11.2F. These segmental
duplications range in size from 32 to 427 kb and have a complex evolutionary
structure. Therefore, the complex structure of the LCR10s in this region appears to
be involved in generating a variety of different genomic rearrangements. The finding
of different sized rearrangements on chromosome 10q is similar to that observed for
other recurrent genomic disorders, such as the Prader Willi/Angelman syndrome,
Smith-Magenis syndrome, and the 15q24 deletion syndrome, where recombination
within alternate LCRs can result in recurrent deletions and duplications of different
size. CNVs overlapping the proximal LCRs are also frequent in control subjects.
More recently a smaller duplication have been reported in patients showed the
Zappella variant of Rett syndrome (Z-RTT) (Artuso 2011). The 10q11.22 duplication
was considered a hypothetical modifier that can modulate the phenotype in patients
matched for MECP2 mutation.

1.9 Phenotype variability in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.

Microdeletion of chromosome 22q11.2 or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome
(22q11.2DS) (MIM#188400/#192430) is the most common human deletion
syndrome with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 4,000 live births (Goodship et al.
1998). The phenotypic spectrum encompasses several previously described
syndromes including DiGeorge, velocardiofacial and conotruncal anomaly face
syndromes as well as some individuals with other conditions such as Cayler
cardiofacial syndrome. The phenotypic expression of the 22q11.2DS is known to be
highly variable and ranges from a severe life-threatening condition to affected
individuals with few associated features (Bassett et al. 2005; Kobrynski and Sullivan
2007; Ryan et al. 1997). The most frequent feature is a conotruncal heart defect,
often associated with facial dysmorphisms, cleft palate, thymus hypoplasia, and

17

learning disability (McDonald 1999). Developmental delays and learning difficulties
are very commonly associated, although severe intellectual disability is rare.
Recurrent seizures are common and epilepsy may be present in about 5% of patients.
Psychiatric conditions may be present in children and over 60% of patients develop
treatable psychiatric disorders by adulthood (Bassett et al. 2005). In particular, due to
the high frequency of schizophrenia in 22q11.2DS patients, the 22q11.2 region is
considered to be one of the main schizophrenia susceptibility loci in humans (Bassett
and Chow 2008; Insel 2010). Evidence from multiple studies indicates that about 1%
of individuals with schizophrenia in the general population have 22q11.2 deletions
(Bassett et al. 2010).
The high frequency of the 22q11.2 deletion can be explained by the presence
of chromosome-specific low copy repeats flanking (LCR A and D) or within the
typically deleted region (LCR A’, B and C) (Shaikh TH 200). Most deletions (84–
90%) encompass ~3 Mb, known as the typically deleted region. Smaller deletions,
spanning 1.5 Mb, are found in about 7–14% of the cases (Carlson 1997; Saitta 2004).
In addition, atypical deletions have also been described in a few patients (GarciaMinaur 2002; O’Donnell 1997; Rauch A 1999). Shaikh et al. (Shaikh 2000) stated
that 22q11.2 LCRs share 97.98% nucleotide sequence identity. The size and the
homology among them seem to be related to the frequency of each type of deletion.
As clinical variability is not explained by differences in gene content within
the deletion, allelic variation(s) in the non-deleted homologous region is considered a
possible contributor to phenotypic variability. Most of the genes from the 22q11.2
deletion region are expressed in fetal and adult brain, thus are candidates for both the
psychiatric phenotype of patients with 22q11.2 deletions and susceptibility to
psychiatric disorders in the general population (Meechan et al. 2010).

2. AIM and OUTLINE OF
THE STUDY

19

2) AIM AND OUTLINE OF THE STUDY

Accumulating evidence from a decade of array-CGH demonstrated that the
single model attributing disease phenotype to a single pathogenic CNV does not fit
all cases. We can thus distinguish two types of genomic disorders: syndromic forms
where the phenotypic features are largely invariant and fully penetrant such as
Williams syndrome (MIM#194050) and Angelman (MIM#105830) or Prader-Willi
syndrome (MIM#176270), and those where the same genomic rearrangement
associates with a set of diagnoses of different severity or with a complete normal
phenotype such as the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome. In this latter type of
genomic disorders, there is growing appreciation that CNVs can be viewed as
contributing to the pathogenesis of “recessive” diseases, rather than simply
functioning as dominant variants with reduced penetrance. Alternatively, CNVs can
be responsible of complex disorders such as obesity in association with multiple
high-penetrant alleles of low frequency. To confirm these alternative explanations of
phenotypic variability, I focused my thesis on the investigation of three different
genomic

rearrangements:

the

22q11.2

microdeletion,

the

16p11.2

microdeletion/duplication and the 10q11.22 deletion/duplication.
The 22q11.2 microdeletion is known to be associated with a variety of
phenotypes

including

velocardiofacial

syndrome,

isolated

cardiac

defect,

schizophrenia and Van den Ende-Gupta syndrome (MIM#600920). For the latter, the
presence of a recessive allele unmasked by the deletion has been recently
demonstrated. In order to identify additional recessive alleles we performed targeted
sequencing on three patients with a 22q11.2 deletion and an atypical phenotype
(MURCS, severe intellectual deficit with polydactyly and Cayler) in collaboration
with the University of Geneva.
Deletions and duplications of chromosome 16p11.2 were already reported as
associated with reduced penetrance with ASDs and schizophrenia, two complex traits
at the opposite ends of a single spectrum of psychiatric phenotypes. Thanks to a
collaborative effort among several Medical Genetics Units, we show that deletions
and duplications on chromosome 16p11.2 could also have an impact on the body
mass index.

20

To date, interstitial deletions involving 10q11.2 have been reported in over 40
patients with variable abnormal phenotype, individual with a normal phenotype and
two prenatal cases. The only clinical feature common to the majority of subjects was
ID/DD. We recently reported that a small duplication on 10q11.22 including
GPRIN2 gene, a regulator of neurite outgrowth, and PPYR1, a gene involved in
energy homeostasis, is a candidate modifier for Rett syndrome (MIM#312750). In
the present study we explored the association of CNVs at 10q11.22 with ASD and
body mass index (BMI)
Moreover we reported two unrelated girls carrying a duplication of the
Miller-Dieker region at 17p13.3. So far only few cases with this duplication have
been reported. Molecular cytogenetic analyses show that in both patients the 17p
duplication is the result of an unbalanced translocation and therefore the resulting
phenotype is more complex. However we further delineate the features associated
with this novel microdeletion syndrome.

22

3) MATERIALS & METHODS

3.1 Patients collection

Patients with ID and MCA enrolled in this study have been selected among
those referred the Medical Genetics Unit of the University Hospital of Siena. All
patients were evaluated by clinical geneticists.

3.2 Array-based CGH

3.2.1 Samples preparation

Genomic DNA of normal controls was obtained from Promega. Genomic
DNAs were extracted from peripheral blood samples using a QIAamp DNA Blood
Maxi kit according to the manufacturer protocol (Qiagen, www.qiagen.com). The
OD260/280 method on a photometer was employed to determine the appropriate
DNA concentration (Sambrook 1989). Patient and control DNA samples were
sonicated to produce a homogeneous smear DNA extending from approximately 600
bp to 2 Kb. DNA samples were then purified using the DNA Clean and Concentrator
kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Ten micrograms of genomic DNA both from the
patient and from the control were sonicated. Test and reference DNA samples were
subsequently purify using dedicated columns (DNA Clean and Concentrator, Zymo
research, CA92867-4619, USA) and the appropriate DNA concentrations were
determine by a DyNA Quant™ 200 Fluorometer (GE Healthcare).

3.2.2 Human oligonucleotides array

Array based CGH analysis was performed using commercially available
oligonucleotide microarrays containing about 43,000 60-mer probes with an
estimated average resolution of about 100-130 Kb (Human Genome CGH
Microarray 44B Kit, Agilent Technologies) and microarrays containing 99,000 60mer probes with an estimate average resolution of 50-65 Kb (Human Genome CGH

23

Microarray 105A Kit, Agilent Technologies). Physical positions of the probes
correspond to the UCSC genome browser - GRCh build 37, Feb 2009
(http://genome.ucsc.edu). DNA labelling was executed essentially according to the
Agilent protocol (Oligonucleotide Array-Based CGH for Genomic DNA Analysis
2.0v) using the Bioprime DNA labelling system (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA (2 µg)
was mixed with 20 µl of 2.5X Random primer solution (Invitrogen) and MilliQ water
to a total volume of 41 µl. The mix was denaturated at 95° C for 7 minutes and then
incubated in ice/water for 5 minutes. Each sample was added with 5 µl of 10X dUTP
nucleotide mix (1.2 mM dATP, dGTP, dCTP, 0.6 mM dTTP in 10 mM Tris pH 8
and 1 mM EDTA), 2.5 µl of Cy5-dUTP (test sample) or 2.5 µl of Cy3-dUTP
(reference sample) and with 1.5 µl of Exo-Klenow (40 U/µl, Invitrogen). Labeled
samples were subsequently purified using CyScribe GFX Purification kit (Amersham
Biosciences) according to the manufacturer protocol. Test and reference DNA were
pooled and mixed with 50 µg of Human Cot I DNA (Invitrogen), 50 µl of Blocking
buffer (Agilent Technologies) and 250 µl of Hybridization buffer (Agilent
Technologies). Before hybridization to the array the mix was denatured at 95°C for 7
minutes and then pre-associated at 37°C for 30 minutes. Probes were applied to the
slide using an Agilent microarray hybridization station. Hybridization was carried
out for 24/40 hrs at 65°C in a rotating oven (20 rpm). The array was disassembled
and washed according to the manufacturer protocol with wash buffers supplied with
the Agilent kit. The slides were dried and scanned using an Agilent G2565BA DNA
microarray scanner. Image analysis was performed using the CGH Analytics
software v.3.4.40 with default settings. The software automatically determines the
fluorescence intensities of the spots for both fluorochromes performing background
subtraction and data normalization, and compiles the data into a spreadsheet that
links the fluorescent signal of every oligo on the array to the oligo name, its position
on the array and its position in the genome. The linear order of the oligos is
reconstituted in the ratio plots consistent with an ideogram. The ratio plot is
arbitrarily assigned such that gains and losses in DNA copy number at a particular
locus are observed as a deviation of the ratio plot from a modal value of 1.0.

3.3 Real-time quantitative PCR

Some aCGH data were confirmed by Real-time Quantitative PCR
experiments. To design adequate probes in different regions of the human genome,
we used an TaqMan Gene Expression Assays by design which provides pre-designed
primers-probe

set

for

real-time

PCR

experiments

(Applied

Biosystems,

https://products.appliedbiosystems.com). PCR was carried out using an ABI prism
7000 (Applied Biosystems) in a 96-well optical plate with a final reaction volume of
50 µl. A total of 100 ng (10 µl) was dispensed in each of the four sample wells for
quadruplicate reactions. Thermal cycling conditions included a pre-run of 2 min at
50°C and 10 min at 95°C. Cycle conditions were 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and
60°C for 1 min according to the TaqMan Universal PCR Protocol (ABI). The
TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and Microamp reaction tubes were supplied by
Applied Biosystems. The starting copy number of the unknown samples was
determined using the comparative Ct method as previously described (Ariani 2004).

3.4 Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA)

MLPA analysis was performed according to the provider’s protocol with a
specifically designed set of probes for testing critical regions in DiGeorge syndrome
(SALSA P023 kit; MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, Netherlands; http://www.mrcholland.com), 1p-deletion syndrome, Williams syndrome, Smith-Magenis syndrome,
Miller-Dieker syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Alagille
syndrome, Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, Sotos syndrome: (SALSA P064B MR1 kit)
and subtelomere regions (SALSA P036D subtelomeric primer kit). The ligation
products were amplified by PCR using the common primer set with the 6-FAM label
distributed by the supplier. Briefly, 100 ng of genomic DNA was diluted with TE
buffer to 5 µl, denatured at 98°C for 5 minutes and hybridized with SALSA Probemix at 60°C overnight. Ligase-65 mix was then added and ligation was performed at
54°C for 15 minutes. The ligase was successively inactivated by heat, 98°C for 5
minutes. PCR reaction was performed in a 50 µl volume. Primers, dNTP and
polymerase were added and amplification was carried out for 35 cycles (30 seconds

25

at 95°C, 30 seconds at 60°C and 60 seconds at 72°C). Amplification products were
identified and quantified by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 310 genetic
analyzer, using GENESCAN software (version 3.7) all from Applied Biosystems
(Foster City, CA, USA). The peak areas of the PCR products were determined by
GENOTYPER software (Applied Biosystems). A spreadsheet was developed in
MicrosoftTM Excel in order to process the sample data efficiently. Data were
normalized by dividing each probe’s peak area by the average peak area of the
sample. This normalized peak pattern was divided by the average normalized peak
pattern

of

all

the

samples

in

the

same

experiment

(Koolen

2004).

ABSTRACT
Duplications of the Miller-Dieker region at 17p13.3 and involving the PAFAH1B1
gene have been recently reported only in few cases so far. These cases were mostly
due to de novo events. We report two unrelated girls carrying this duplication who
exhibited intellectual deficit, microcephaly and facial dysmorphisms. Molecular
cytogenetic analyses show that in both patients the 17p duplication is the result of an
unbalanced translocation involving two different chromosomes: 9p24.2 in one case
and 10q26.2 in the other. The facial features of our patients closely resemble those

29

previously reported, indicating that 17p13.3 duplication causes a quite distinctive
facial phenotype. The overall phenotype of these two cases is complicated by the
presence of a second copy number variation, and some phenotypic features of our
patients can be attributed either to 9p deletion or 10q deletion. Overall, these new
cases indicate that the 17p13.3 microduplication may be more frequent than thought
and originates not only from de novo events. Moreover, we confirm the absence of
gross anomalies of brain morphology in cases with PAFAH1B1 gene duplications
with respect to the PAFAH1B1 deletion, as in Miller-Dieker syndrome.

INTRODUCTION
The use of array comparative genome hybridization (array-CGH) analysis for the
investigation of children with intellectual disability (ID) has allowed the
identification of numerous new microdeletion and microduplication syndromes,
some of which have been clinically well characterized. Most of these rearrangements
are the result of non-allelic homologous recombination between region of low copy
repeats (LCRs) [1].
The short arm of chromosome 17 is prone to copy number variations (CNVs) due to
a high density of LCRs [2]. Most of the rearrangements harboured on chromosome
17p lead to specular syndrome: the Charcot Marie Tooth syndrome type 1A due to a
duplication in 17p12 and the Hereditary Neuropathy with liability to Pressure Palsies
due to the reciprocal deletion [Chance et al., 1994; Reiter et al., 1996][3, 4]; the
Smith-Magenis syndrome and the Potocki-Lupski syndrome due to a deletion and a
duplication of the 17p11.2 region, respectively [5, 6]. Terminal deletions of
chromosome 17p are associated with isolated lissencephaly when they include the
PAFAH1B1 gene, or with Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) when the 17p deletions
also include the YWHAE gene [7-9].
Recently, isolated 17p13.3 duplications involving the PAFAH1B1 gene have been
reported in seven patients with psychomotor retardation, hypotonia and dysmorphic
features without lissencephaly or gross brain malformations [10-12]. The phenotype

30

of transgenic mice

conditionally overexpressing

PAFAH1B1

was

indeed

characterized by decreased brain size and neuronal migration abnormalities [10].
Bruno and colleagues identified two classes of co-locating microduplications in
17p13.3: class I duplications including YWHAE but not PAFAH1B1; and class II
duplications always including PAFAH1B1, and sometimes including the genomic
region encompassing the CRK and YWHAE genes [11]. Class I microduplications are
associated with intellectual disability (ID), subtle dysmorphic facial features, subtle
hand/foot malformations, and a tendency toward postnatal overgrowth [11]. Class II
microduplications recently have been shown to be associated with mild to moderate
ID and hypotonia. Some dysmorphic features, such as prominent forehead and
pointed chin, are shared with class I duplications, while overgrowth, behavioural
problems and hand/foot abnormalities are less often noted.
A complex rearrangement including the 17p13.3 microduplication has been reported
in association with a second CNV in two cases. The rearrangement originated in a
balanced translocation present in a parent [t(9;17) and t(X;17)] [13, 14].
The known 9p deletion syndrome was first described by Alfi et al. in 1973 [15]. This
is an heterogeneous condition with variable deletion size characterized by ID,
congenital malformations including trigonocephaly, congenital heart defect,
anorectal and genital anomalies and dysmorphisms [16-19]. The critical region for
the 9p deletion syndrome has been located between bands p22.3 and p24.1 [19]. The
deletions of the more terminal part of chromosome 9p are rarer and some of them
coexist in the same patient together with larger rearrangements in other
chromosomes [20, 14, 21, 22]. Patients with deletions involving the 9p24.3 band
show male to female sex reversal, possibly due to DMRT1 and DMRT2
haploinsufficiency [23, 24].
Terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 10 is a relatively frequent
cytogenetic abnormality with clinical heterogeneity even among members of the
same family [25]. Characteristic features of 10q deletion syndrome include peculiar
facial features, cardiac and urogenital anomalies and neurodevelopmental deficit
[26]. The critical region of the 10q deletion syndrome corresponds to a segment of
~600 Kb in 10q26.2 encompassing two genes, DOCK1 and C10orf90 [27].

31

This report describes two additional cases with a reciprocal duplication of the MDS
region, suggesting that this condition may be less rare than previously thought. Both
cases are the unbalanced result of two different balanced translocations:
t(9;17)(p24.2;p13.3) and t(10;17)(q26.2;p13.2) and, therefore, their phenotypes are
more complex than those of cases with isolated 17p13.3 microduplications.
Nevertheless, the core phenotype of the 17p13.3 duplication is recognizable. This
paper reviews the literature on the 17p13.3 region and further delineates the features
associated with this novel microduplication syndrome.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Patients
Written informed consent was obtained from the guardians of the patients included in
this study. Participation in the study did not alter the standard of care.

Clinical Reports
Patient 1 is a 13 years and 5 months old girl, the second child of healthy unrelated
parents (Fig.1a and Table 1). The girl was born at the 38th week of pregnancy by
caesarean section due to fetal sufferance. Her birth weight was 3150 gr (50-75th
percentile) and her length was 49 cm (50-75th percentile). Apgar score and head
circumference (OFC) measurements were not available. She presented feeding
difficulties and gastro esophageal reflux. The patient exhibited severe developmental
delay. She never acquired sphincter control. She frequently suffered from respiratory
infections during childhood. She presented drug-resistent epilepsy from the age of
six months. Brain MRI performed at 10 years of age showed marked dilatation of the
supratentorial ventricles and dilatation of the cisterna magna possibly due to a
leptomeningeal cyst. Cardiac ultrasounds showed atrial septal defect and
ventriculomegaly. Abdominal ultrasound was normal. No other major abnormalities
were present. Physical examination at 12y1m ( Fig.1b) showed: height, 128 cm
(<<3rd percentile), weight, 27 kg (<<3rd percentile), microcephaly (OFC of 50 cm;
<<3rd percentile), triangular face with pointed chin, upslanting palpebral fissures,
sparse and V-shaped eyebrows, open mouth with protruding tongue, sialorrhea,

32

prominent nose, scoliosis and flat feet. The patient was able to walk independently,
exhibited hand stereotypes, and was able to grasp. She also showed hyperactivity and
continuously tried to catch the attention of the people around her. Standard karyotype
from peripheral blood lymphocytes was normal.
Patient 2 is a 15 years and 4 months old girl, the second child of healthy unrelated
parents (Fig.1c and Table 1). The mother had two spontaneous miscarriages in the
first month of gestation. At the time of her birth, Patient 2’s mother and father were
26 and 29 years old, respectively. The proband had a healthy older brother and two
maternal cousins referred with psychomotor delay (not available for testing). The girl
was born after a prolonged labour at term of an uneventful pregnancy. At birth,
weight was 3300 gr (50th percentile) and length was 51 cm (50-75th percentile).
Apgar score and OFC measurements were not available. A pale haemangioma of the
forehead was observed. Patient 2 showed developmental delay: she began to sit alone
at 1.5 year, crawled at 2 years, began to walk independently at 2.5 years, and said the
first words at 5 years. She never acquired sphincter control and frequently suffered
from respiratory infections during childhood. At 4 years the patient was surgically
treated for strabismus. A radiological examination of skeletal development of the
left-hand wrist showed mild bone-age delay (chronological age 5 years and 8
months, bone-age corresponding to 5 years and 1 month). A radiological survey of
hands and feet performed at 11 years and 6 months showed aplasia of a phalanx of
the fifth finger of both feet and a medial notch of the second phalanx of II finger of
the left hand. Repeated EEGs were alternatively normal or showed a mild
disorganization of the deep rhythm. Results of ophtalmological evaluation were
normal except for mild myopia (-1.25/-1.50 diopters). A pelvic ultrasound showed
mild irregularities of the morphology of the uterus. The following investigations
were normal: abdominal and cardiac ultrasound, brain MRI and karyotype. Physical
examination of Patient 2 at 11y1m (Fig.1d) demonstrated normal height (145 cm; 2550th percentile) and weight (40 kg; 50-75th percentile), microcephaly (OFC of 48 cm;
<<3rd percentile), triangular face, with pointed chin, synophrys, thickening in the
medial part and V-shaped eyebrows, open mouth, high and narrow palate, and
hypoplastic 5th toe, more evident on the right side. The patient showed ataxic gait,
rocking of the trunk in upright position, unmotivated laughter and sialorrhea. At the

33

time of our examination Patient 2 had just begun to formulate sentences, always
spoke to catch attention, displayed hyperactivity, and brought all objects to to her
mouth. Patient 2’s mother exhibited isolated microcephaly (OFC 52 cm, <3rd
percentile) and normal height (169 cm; 75-90th percentile).

Array-CGH analysis
Array-CGH analysis was performed using commercially available oligonucleotide
microarrays containing about 44.000 60-mer probes (Human Genome CGH
Microarray 44B Kit, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and as previously reported [28]. The average spatial
resolution of the probes was about 45 kb. Probe locations were assigned according to
UCSC Genome Browser, GRCh37/hg19, Feb 2009 (http://genome.ucsc.edu).

Multiplex Ligation-dependant Probe Amplification (MLPA) analysis
We used a distinct commercially available MLPA kit, the SALSA P036D
subtelomeric primer set (MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). This kit
contains oligonucleotide primer sets specific for the amplification of selected loci in
the subtelomeric regions of all chromosome arms, except for the acrocentric
chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22 that effectively lack a short arm. For the latter,
the manufacturer has included in this kit primer sets specific for loci adjacent to the
centromere in the long arm of the acrocentric chromosomes, referred to as the
‘acrocentric’ primer. This kit was previously validated in other laboratories (data not
shown) on series of patients with known subtelomeric ultra conserved regions
(UCRs) [29, 30]. The target loci of this kit represent known functional genes or
protein coding sequences. Each experiment was carried out according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis
Chromosomal preparations for the analysis were obtained according to standard
techniques. FISH was performed with TelVision 9p and 17p probes (Vysis). Each
experiment was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

RESULTS
In Patient 1 array-CGH analysis detected the presence of two telomeric
rearrangements:

a

~6.9

Mb

terminal

deletion

of

chromosome

10

[arr

10q26.2q26.3(128,467.040-135,404,471)x1] and a ~5.5 Mb terminal duplication of
chromosome 17 [arr 17p13.3p13.2(48,539-5,514,628)x3] (Fig. 2 a and b). Patient 2
had a ~4.4 Mb deletion on chromosome 9 [arr 9p24.3p24.2(204,193-4,600,751)x1]
and a ~3 Mb duplication on chromosome 17 [arr 17p13.3(48,538-3,058,821)x3]
(Fig.3 a and b). The array-CGH analysis also revealed a 50 Kb duplication in Xq28
[arr Xq28(148,690,284-148,728,581)x3 mat] in the proband and her mother, already
reported in healthy individuals and thus probably not associated with a phenotype
[31] (data not shown).
MLPA analysis confirmed the presence of a duplication of the area containing the
RPH3AL probe on chromosome 17p13.3 in both patients, a deletion of the PAOX
probe on chromosome 10q26.3 in Patient 1, and a deletion of the DMRT1 probe on
chromosome 9p24.3 in Patient 2 (data not shown).
FISH analysis of the parents of both patients, performed using telomeric probes for
chromosomes 10 and 17 in family 1 and probes for chromosomes 9 and 17 in family
2, revealed a balanced translocation in Patient 1’s father and Patient 2’s mother (data
not shown). Given the presence of microcephaly in the otherwise healthy mother of
Patient 2, we also performed array-CGH analysis on the mother’s DNA, to ascertain
if the translocation was balanced. The analysis revealed no gains or losses at both
breakpoints (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
These two cases, together with the others previously reported in the literature, concur
to define the 17q13.3 microduplication syndrome [10, 11, 13, 14, 12]. We excluded
from the analysis cases with class I microduplications centred on the YWHAE gene
(cases 1, 2, 3 and 4 from Bi [10], and cases 9 and 11 from Bruno [11]), and we
considered only cases with class II microduplications. All patients except two
reported by Bi et al. [10] (patient 5 and 6), have large duplications, including both
PAFAH1B1 and YWHAE genes (Fig.4).

35

When we compared our cases with those previously described (Tab. I), it appeared
that the duplicated patients had many facial features in common. All patients, even at
a younger age, had pointed chin; this characteristic was augmented in adolescence
resulting in the triangular shape of the face (8/8). In all older patients a high nasal
bridge became evident and most of them (7/9) had V shaped eyebrows.
Concerning the physical phenotype, microcephaly, or at least deceleration of head
growth, was a consistent sign (9/10). Concurrently, some patients had a progressive
reduction in height (3/8) and weight (4/8) growth. According to our review, degree of
ID was variable, ranging from mild to severe (6/9). Very interestingly, we found that
recurrent respiratory infections during childhood were reported in 7 patients. This
characteristic was not emphasized previously in this microduplication syndrome.
From a clinical point of view, the frequent respiratory infections, together with the
deceleration of growth, could be used as an additional diagnostic handle of the
syndrome.
Previous studies showed that transgenic mice over-expressing PAFAH1B1 showed
migration defect and reduced brain volume [10]. The latter sign is also present in
humans, since most patients (9/10) showed microcephaly. On the other hand,
neuronal migration defects were not detected by neuroimaging studies (Tab.1).
Therefore, our data confirm that PAFAH1B1 over-expression in humans does not
cause neuronal migration defects or other gross brain malformations.
Since the 17p duplications of our patients originated from two unbalanced
translocations, some of the clinical features can also be explained by 10q and 9p
deletions. Terminal deletions of long arm of chromosome 10 are associated with
broad/prominent nasal bridge, prominent nose, strabismus, thin upper lip, and fifth
finger clinodactyly. Postnatal low weight and microcephaly are occasionally found
[32]. The very prominent and abnormal shaped nose of Patient 1 may be the result of
the combined effect of both 17p duplications and 10q deletion. The 10q deletion of
Patient 1 includes the DOCK1 gene, contributing to ID in 10q- syndrome [27] and
DPYSL4 (or CRMP3), a critical factor regulating dendrite arborization and spine
morphology in the hippocampus [33].
Deletions of the terminal portion of the short arm of chromosome 9 are associated
with ID due to DOCK8 haploinsufficiency [34, 35] and a male to female sex

36

reversal, possibly due to DMRT1 and DMRT2 haploinsufficiency [23]. Although in
female patients no urogenital anomalies are reported, we cannot completely rule out
the hypothesis that the mild abnormal morphology of the uterus reported in our
patient could be due to haploinsufficiency of the 9p region. Therefore, more accurate
gynaecologic evaluation in the proband could be useful.
The rearrangements present in our patients originated from a balanced translocation
present in a parent as demonstrated by FISH analysis. In family 2, the mother
presented isolated microcephaly with normal intellectual functioning, and
experienced two spontaneous miscarriages in the first month of gestation. In
addition, the family history revealed that, two maternal cousins of the proband
suffered from psychomotor delay. All these data indicated a segregation of the
translocation in the maternal branch of the family. A similar translocation was
previously reported by Kohler et al [14], in a family with two siblings showing an
unbalanced translocation t(9;17)(p24.2;p13.3) that had originated from a balanced
translocation present in the mother (Tab. 1). Family history also highlighted two
spontaneous miscarriages and recurrent neonatal deaths; two of the fetuses showed
the typical signs of MDS. The authors ascribed to the 17p deletion all of the early
deaths in the family [14]. The same explanation may be given for the miscarriages
reported in the families reported in this study.
The presence of microcephaly in both Patient 2 and her mother led us to consider
disrupted genes at the breakpoints as possible candidate causes of microcephaly. The
breakpoint at chromosome 17 did not disrupt genes, while the breakpoint at
chromosome 9 interrupted the C9orf68 gene, which has a sequence homology to
SPATA6, encoding for a spermatogenesis-associated protein 6 precursor. A dosage
alteration of genes located near the breakpoints due to a positional effect cannot be
excluded as a possible cause for the microcephaly present both in the patient and her
mother.
Overall, these new cases suggest that the 17p13.3 microduplication may be more
frequent than thought. Our results confirm the absence of gross anomalies of brain
morphology in cases with PAFAH1B1 gene duplications in contrast to its
haploinsufficiency. In the two cases reported here, the phenotype is more complex
resulting from the combined effect of the duplication of the region involved in the

37

MDS and of a second CNV. Nevertheless, the core phenotype of the 17p13.3
duplication is recognizable and consists of V-shaped eyebrows, prominent nose, a
high nasal bridge, a pointed chin evolving in a triangular face, decreased growth of
the head, decreased height and weight, and recurrent infections.

Mirror effects for Autism Spectrum Disorder due to gene dosage at
10q11.22 affecting GPRIN2 and PPYR1.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a group of neurodevelopmental
disorders that are characterized by impaired reciprocal social interactions, delayed or
aberrant communication, and stereotyped, repetitive behaviours, often with restricted
interests (Hu 2011). The prevalence for these disorders is now estimated at 1%
(Gillbert 1999, Forbonne 2003, Kogan 2009). With a concordance rate as high as
90% in monozygotic twins and 2-10% in dizygotic twin pairs (Folstein 2001), ASD
is among the most heritable of neuropsychiatric conditions. Although autism or
autism features often occur in single gene disorders such as Tuberous Sclerosis
(MIM#191100) and Fragile X syndrome (MIM#300624) (Gillberg and Coleman
2000), these disorders only explain around 2-5% of the autism cases (Baker 1998,
Carney 2003; Kielinen 2004, Volkmar 2005, Hatton 2006). Thus a considerable
amount of effort has been devoted to identifying genetic mutations or variants that
associate with these disorders.
Until recently, karyotyping has been the standard method for the detection of
cytogenetic aberrations in patients with developmental disorders. The development
of whole-genome screening methodologies for the detection of CNVs, such as arrayCGH, provides a much higher resolution than karyotyping leading to the
identification of novel microdeletion and microduplication syndromes, such as
deletions and duplications in chromosome band 15q13.2q13.3, 16p11.2, and
17p11.2, often associated with an autism phenotype (Ballif et al., 2007; Potocki et
al., 2007; Weiss et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2009). The discovery of an increasing
number of genomic disorders, allowed the identification of NAHR as the
predominant underlying molecular mechanism using the segmental duplication or
LCRs as recombination substrates (Stankiewicz and Lupski 2010). LCRs have been
defined as human DNA fragments >1 Kb in size and of 90% DNA sequence identity
that can mediate constitutional and somatic genomic rearrangements (Stankiewicz
and Lupski 2010). The constantly increasing resolution of the arrays has further

57

improved the detection of copy number abnormalities down to single genes and is
likely to provide new advances in the autism genetics field. Although clinical genetic
laboratories are familiar with recurrent copy-number changes mediated by segmental
duplication architecture, population studies suggest that the vast majority of copynumber variation is not recurrent (Itsara 2009). Even if array-CGH offers the
sensitivity of high-resolution genome-wide detection of clinically significant CNVs,
the additional challenge of interesting variants of uncertain clinical significance can
impose a burden on clinicians and laboratories (Vos 2009).
We recently reported that a small duplication on 10q11.22 including GPRIN2 gene, a
regulator of neurite outgrowth, and PPYR1, a gene involved in energy homeostasis,
is a candidate modifier for Rett syndrome (Artuso 2011). Specifically, duplications
were found in the Zappella variant, the Rett variant with recovery of speech, and
lacking the typical growth delay, underweighting and autistic features. Since PPYR1
knockout mice display underweight and reduced white adipose tissue (Sainsbury et
al.) we supposed that an over-expression of PPYR1 due to gene duplication may be
responsible for the higher body weight characterizing Zappella variant. In Artuso et
al, we concluded that duplication at 10q11.22 may play a role in protecting from both
underweighting and autistic features in Rett patients (Artuso 2011).
In the present study, we explored the association of CNV at 10q11.22 with ASD in a
cohort of 1394 patients received for a wide range of referring diagnoses, including
Syndromic Intellectual Disability (SID), Non Syndromic Intellectual Disability
(NSID), ASD and MCA.

Materials and methods

Cases and controls.
This study collected patients with SID, NSID, ASD and MCA, obtained from 2
sources. Patients were ascertained by the Medical Genetics Unit of Siena, Italy
(n=304), and by the Laboratory of Genetics Diagnosis, IRRCS Oasi SS Maria of
Troina, Italy (n=1090), 320 control subjects were collected for this study.
Experiments were performed on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood
samples from each patients after informed consent approved by the local Institutional

58

Review Board. Moreover two additional centres have been contacted: the
Laboratoire Génétique Chromosomique, Hôpital Couple enfant, CHU Grenoble,
France, and the Unidad de Neurologia Infanto-juvenil Hospital Universitario Quiron
Centro CADE, Madrid, Spain. We are still collected data from these centres

Array-CGH
Array-CGH analysis was performed using commercially available oligonucleotide
microarrays containing about 105.000 60-mer probes (Human Genome CGH
Microarray 105K Kit respectively, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California) as
previously reported by Pescucci et al.

Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification (MLPA)
MLPA probes were designed according to protocols available at MRC Holland
website (http://www.mrc−holland.com/pages/indexpag.html). Two and three MLPA
probes targeted the GPRIN2 and the PPYR1 genes, respectively. MLPA analysis was
carried out essentially as described by Schouten et al. PCR products were identified
and quantified by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130 genetic analyzer, using
the Gene Mapper software from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA. In order to
process efficiently the MLPA deletion/ duplication data, a spreadsheet was generated
in Microsoft Excel. First, the data corresponding to each sample (patient’s and
control’s DNAs) were normalized by dividing each probe’s signal strength (i.e., the
area of each peak) by the average signal strength yielded by the 10 control probes to
generate for each peak a Relative Peak Area (RPA) value. The RPA value for each
probe in the patient’s sample was then compared to that of a control’s sample by
dividing, for each peak, the patient’s RPA by the control’s RPA. The latter ratio was
then used to define the following categories: (i)
duplicated gene region, (ii)

0,5 if deleted, (iii)

1, for the non-deleted/non-

1,5 if duplicated.

Statistical Analysis
To assess the significance of the frequency of recurrent 10q11.22 CNVs in ASD or
SID/NSID patients and controls, a Fischer’s exact test was used.

59

Results

Identification of CNVs in 10q11.22
In a first analysis performed by array-CGH in our cohort of patients, we identified 12
individuals sharing a overlapping CNV in 10q11.22 (3 deletions and 9 duplications).
The patients carrying the deletion were classified as ASD while the duplicated
patients were classified as SID and NSID. The identified CNVs ranged in size from
~0.17 to ~1.16 Mb (Tab.1 and Fig.1). The smallest region of overlap of
approximately 0.17 Mb included only two genes: the pancreatic polypeptide receptor
1 (PPYR1) and the G protein regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 2 (GPRIN2)
(Fig.1).
In order to investigate a possible association of CNVs at 10q11.22 (46,976,15747,148,490) with ASD we collected additional patients. Among our cohort we
selected 292 patients that have been previously analysed by array-CGH 44K and
were negative for deletions and duplications in10q11.22. Because the 44K slides
have only one probe located in the 10q11.22 region, we decided to reanalyze these
cohort of patients by MLPA. An additional cohort of 1090 patients was collected
from Troina (Italy). We divided the collected patients in ASD group (398
individuals) and SID/NSID group (984 individuals). Moreover we included in the
MLPA analysis a cohort of 320 control subjects. We identified 7 deletions in the
ASD group, 4 deletions in the SID/NSID group while no deletions were found in the
control group. We also analysed the ASD, SID/NSID and control group looking for
duplications in the 10q11.22 region. Seven duplications were found in the ASD
group, 43 were found in the SID/NSID group and 10 in the control group.
Combining the results obtained by MLPA and by array-CGH analysis, we obtained a
total of 10/401 deletions and 7/401 duplications in the ASD group, 4/993 and 52/993
deletions and duplications respectively in the SID/NSID group and 10/320
duplications in the control group.
Statistical analysis of our preliminary results shows a significantly correlation
between the presence of the 10q11.22 deletion and the ASD phenotype if compared
both with SID/NSID and control group (tab.2). On the contrary the duplication is
more frequent between SID/NSID and in control cases than in ASD (tab.2).

Identification of additional copy number changes in patients
Three individuals with deletions and 3 individuals with duplications had secondary
copy number alterations. Four of the additional CNVs in patients #79, #681, #283
and #384 were inherited from phenotypically normal parents. The parental origins of
the additional CNVs in patients #1275 and #1410 were unknown. Moreover, three
duplicated patients (#139, #368 and #601) showed a mutation in MECP2 gene
responsible of both the classical and the preserved speech variant form (Zappella
variant) of Rett syndrome.

Association of obesity frequency in deleted and duplicated cohort
Auxological parameters were available only for 41 cases of the 80 showing a CNV in
chromosome 10. We had height and weight measures for 11 patients carrying a
10q11.22 deletion and for 30 patients showing the duplication. Three deleted patients
were overweight, 7 were normal and 1 was underweight. Among the duplicated
cohort 17 cases were overweight, 10 were normal and 3 were underweight. We
considered the frequency of both overweight and underweight in the two cohorts.
The underweight frequency was almost the same in the deleted and duplicated cohort
(9% and 10% respectively). Otherwise the overweight phenotype was more frequent
in the duplicated cohort (56,6%) than in the deleted one (27,3%). We performed the
same analysis taking in account only the patients carrying the smallest
rearrangements. We collected 1 deleted case (#384) and 4 duplicated cases (#139,
#1410, #2307, #2202,). We excluded two patients (#424 and #39) because carried a
duplication including also SYT15 gene. The deleted patients had a normal BMI,
while 75% (3/4) of the duplicated patients were overweight.

Discussion

In a first analysis we observed 12 individuals sharing a 10q11.22 CNV. Three were
deleted and classified as ASD, the other 9 cases were duplicated and classified as
SID/NSID. Although features of developmental delay and dysmorphisms are already
documented (Stankeiwicz 2011), an analysis of CNV-phenotype association has not
been carried out and this CNV has not been classified as pathogenic. To investigate
the nature of this CNV we collected additional patients from Italy (Siena and
Troina), France and Spain. The group of patients reported herein represents the
largest collection of individuals with microdeletions or microduplications within
chromosome 10q11.22 reported in the literature. In the present study we divided our
cohort according to the technique used for the analysis (array-CGH and MLPA) and
each cohort was additionally divided into two group: the ASD group and the
SID/NSID group. We compared the frequency of 10q11.22 rearrangements in the
ASD group in the SID/NSID group and in control group, in order to determine
whether the deletion predisposes individuals to an abnormal phenotype. In total we
identified 10 and 4 deletions in the ASD and SID/NSID group respectively but no
deletions were found in the control group. The reciprocal duplication has also been
reported in literature (Stankaiwicz 2011). Therefore we checked our cohort also for
the presence of duplications in 10q11.22. We found 7 and 52 duplications in the
ASD and SID/NSID group respectively. Unlike the deletion, the duplication has been
detected in 10/320 control subjects suggesting that the duplication had a less
penetrance. Moreover some individuals carried additional genomic imbalances
(tab.1) which could modify the phenotype of these patients.
Stankeiwicz et al. recently reported 24 cases with deletions and 17 cases with
duplications at 10q11.21q21.1. The ~66% of the reported rearrangements were
flanked by large, directly oriented segmental duplications of 98% sequence identity,
suggesting that NAHR caused these genomic rearrangements. Rearrangement in 10
of 12 individuals may have been caused by NAHR between LCR 10q11.2A and LCR
10q11.2B and 2 by LCR 10q11.2A and LCR 10q11.2C. The smallest overlapping
genomic imbalance in 10q11.22 was mapped to be ~170 kb. Only two genes are
located in this region, GPRIN2 and PPYR1 (fig.1).

65

GPRIN2 is highly expressed in the cerebellum and interacts with activated members
of the Gi subfamily of G protein α subunit and functions together with GPRIN1 to
regulate neurite outgrowth (Iida and Kozasa 2004). The fact that GPRIN2 is
exclusively expressed in the cerebellum suggests that it could be involved in the
ASD phenotype when deleted. The differences in deletion and duplication prevalence
between the ASD group and the control populations are statistically significant for
deletion (p=0,002) and not significant for duplications (p=0,09). Because the
10q11.22 deletion is significantly enriched in the ASD population when compared to
the SID/NSID population (p=0,001), we propose that this microdeletion is probably
clinically relevant and responsible for the ASD phenotype.
The PPYR1 gene is a key regulator of energy homeostasis and directly involved in
the regulation of food intake. PPYR1, also named as neuropeptide Y receptor or
pancreatic polypeptide 1, is a member of the seven transmembrane domain-G-protein
coupled receptor family. Genetic variation studies have reinforced the potential
influence of PPYR1 on body weight in humans. Pancreatic polypeptide is the
preferential PPYR1 agonist. Peripheral administration of pancreatic polypeptide
inhibits gastric emptying and decreases food intake in humans (Sha 2009). This
effect is mediated by direct action on local PPYR1 within the arcuate nucleus. Sha et
al, demonstrated that subjects with 10q11.22 loss had 12.4% higher BMI value, and
subjects with 10q11.22 gain had 5.4% lower BMI value when compared to normal
diploid subjects. PPYR1 null animals showed, for instance, an opposite result.
Knockout mice displayed lower body weight and reduced white adipose tissue
accompanied with increased plasma levels of pancreatic polypeptide (Sainsbury et al.
2002).
In order to confirm a correlation between PPYR1 and body weight, we checked the
deleted and duplicated patients of our cohort for BMI. Out of a total of 80 cases with
10q11.22 imbalances, weight and height information were available for 41 (11
deleted and 30 duplicated cases) (tab.3 and tab.4). We noticed that among the deleted
patients only the 27,3% (3/11) were overweight, while the 56,6% (17/30) of
duplicated patients showed a high BMI. Even if not statistically significant the
overweight phenotype was more frequent among the duplicated cohort than among
the deleted one. Moreover one of the deleted cases showing overweight (#1275)

66

presented a second rearrangement that could be responsible for the high BMI.
Because we were interested in the influence of PPYR1 gene on BMI, we took into
account only patients carrying the smallest rearrangement. Surprisingly we noticed
that none of the deleted patients were overweight, while 75% (3/4) of the duplicated
patients had an increased BMI. Our data suggested that a higher level of PPYR1
expression due to gene duplication may correlate with the overweight reported in our
cases. These results are in contrast with those reported by Sha that showed an
association between the 10q11.22 loss and a higher body mass index value in the
Chinese population. A possible explanation could be represented by the different size
of the rearranged region. The CNV reported by Sha is larger with respect to the small
region of overlap reported here and includes two additional genes, SYT15 and
LOC728643. These two genes have not been reported to have relation with any
obesity phenotype. Syt15 mRNA has been found in different tissues (i.e. heart, lung,
skeletal muscle and testis) but unlike other Syt family members was absent in the
brain. Moreover Syt15 C2 domains lack Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding
activity. These results suggested that Syt15 may be involved in constitutive
membrane trafficking in selected non-neuronal tissues (Fukuda 2003). However it is
still unknown whether the interactions of the four genes may lead to the BMI
variation.
In conclusion, our results suggested that recurrent reciprocal microdeletions and
microduplications within 10q11.22 represent novel genomic disorders consisting of
ASD and SID/NSID phenotype respectively. The duplication was observed also in
several controls, suggesting that the duplication confers either no phenotype at all or
a range of phenotypes of varying severity. Moreover contrasting result in BMI
association analysis exist between patients with the deletion and the reciprocal
duplication. In fact an high BMI was more frequently observed in microduplicated
than in deleted patients.
Overall our findings have important implications for genetic counselling. CVNs such
as those described in this report are often associated with unpredictable and variable
phenotypic outcomes and pose diagnostic and counselling difficulties. However, the
analysis of additional patients and controls with 10q11.22 rearrangements is required

67

to reinforce this hypothesis and to obtain a better insight in the potential pathology
associated with the observed microdeletion and microduplication events.

syndromes with unusual phenotypes
Introduction

Microdeletion of chromosome 22q11.2 or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS)
(MIM#188400/#192430) is the most common human deletion syndrome with an
estimated prevalence of 1 in 4,000 live births (Goodship 1998). Up to 93% of cases
occurs de novo, whereas in the remaining 7% the deletion is found to be inherited
from a parent.
The high frequency of the 22q11.2 deletion can be explained by the presence of
chromosome-specific low copy repeats flanking (LCR A and D) or within the
typically deleted region (LCR A, B and C) (Edelmann 1999, Shaikh 2000). Since
LCRs present chromosome-specific repeated DNA sequences, they can be prone to
misalignment during meiosis and unequal recombination exchanges, resulting in
chromosome rearrangements in the 22q11.2 region. Shaikh et al. stated that 22q11.2
LCRs share 97.98% nucleotide sequence identity. The size and the homology among
them seem to be related to the frequency of each type of deletion. The 3 Mb deletion
is the most frequent one (90% of cases), since it is mediated by the largest LCRs, A
and D, which share 250 kb of duplicated sequence in a complex arrangement. On the
other hand, the 1.5 Mb deletion (8%) is flanked by LCRs A and B, which share a
common block of 135 kb. Some smaller or atypical deletions have been reported but
there is no evidence for specific genotype–phenotype correlations. It has been argued
that the 1.5Mb deletions contain all key genes responsible for the syndrome (Carlson
et al., 1997).
The phenotypic spectrum encompasses several previously described syndromes
including DiGeorge, velocardiofacial and conotruncal anomaly face syndromes as
well as some individuals with other conditions such as Cayler cardiofacial syndrome.
The phenotypic expression of the 22q11.2DS is known to be highly variable and
ranges from a severe life-threatening condition to affected individuals with few
associated features (Bassett et al. 2005; Kobrynski and Sullivan 2007; Ryan et al.
1997). Abnormal development of the pharyngeal arches and pharyngeal pouches

71

gives rise to the cardinal physical manifestations of the syndrome: conotruncal
anomaly,

hypocalcemia

due

to

dysfunctional

parathyroid

glands,

palatal

abnormalities and paediatric immunodeficiency that may be secondary to
hypo/aplasia of the thymus (Lindsay et al. 2001; Scambler 2000). Major heart defects
are present in about 40% of cases while minor anomalies, e.g., of the aortic arch,
may be identified only on cardiac ultrasonography. Overt cleft palate is rare, whereas
submucous cleft palate associated with velopharyngeal insufficiency is characteristic
of 22q11.2DS. In contrast, the facial features are considered a constant manifestation
of the syndrome (Guyot et al. 2001), although the overall facial appearance is not
always readily identifiable even to informed clinicians.
Developmental delays and learning difficulties are very commonly associated,
although severe intellectual disability is rare. Recurrent seizures are common,
especially those related to hypocalcemia, and epilepsy may be present in about 5% of
patients. Psychiatric conditions may be present in children and over 60% of patients
develop treatable psychiatric disorders by adulthood (Bassett et al. 2005). This risk is
a major concern for families. In particular, due to the high frequency of
schizophrenia in 22q11.2DS patients, the 22q11.2 region is considered to be one of
the main schizophrenia susceptibility loci in humans (Bassett and Chow 2008; Insel
2010). Evidence from multiple studies indicates that about 1% of individuals with
schizophrenia in the general population have 22q11.2 deletions (Basset et al, 2010).
The commonly deleted region in 22q11.2 encompasses approximately 45 genes and
most of them are expressed in fetal and adult brain, thus are candidates for both the
psychiatric phenotype of patients with 22q11.2 deletions and susceptibility to
psychiatric disorders in the general population (Meechan et al. 2010). As clinical
variability is not explained by differences in gene content within the deletion, allelic
variation(s) in the non-deleted homologous region is considered a possible
contributor to phenotypic variability.
In order to identify possible recessive alleles we performed targeted sequencing on
three patients with a 22q11.2 deletion and an atypical phenotype (MURCS, severe
intellectual deficit with polydactyly and Cayler syndrome) in collaboration with the
University of Geneva.

Materials and methods.

Target sequence
The libraries for paired end sequencing were prepared with an Illumina library prep
kit and captured with a custom made Agilent capture kit designed for the 3Mb
deletion region. The kit was able to capture the 3 Mb of the classical VCFS region
plus ~200 Kb upstream and downstream to the breakpoints. It didn’t capture the
repeated regions. Briefly, 3 µg of DNA were sheared using the Covaris instrument.
After fragmentation, the ends were irregular with 3’ and 5’ overhangs, so the “ends
repairing” was performed. This step converted all the ends into blunt ends using T4
polymerase and Klenow DNA polymerase enzymes. The latter enzyme had a 3’ to 5’
exonuclease activity, removing 3’ overhangs. The polymerase instead refilled the 5’
overhangs. Finally a T4 polynecleotide kinase phosphorylated the 5’ ends. The
phosphorylation of the 5’ ends was a necessary step for the ligation of the indexspecific paired-end adapter. The capture process continued with the hybridization, in
which biotinylated fragments were added. This fragments were complementary to the
fragment of interest and can be isolated using streptavidin coated beads. The
biotinylated baits were then removed and the index tags were added. The final step
was the pooling of the sample. The samples were sequenced in a HiSeq2000.

The pipeline
The obtained reads were aligned to a reference genome with BWA. On average, the
samples had 99% of the target region covered at least 8x. SNVs and small indels
were called using Samtools, that recognized the data in a format that described the
base pair information at each chromosomal position; and Pindel2, that identified long
insertions or deletions. Finally the variants were annotated with Annovar.

76

Results

We obtained from the sequencing a total of 440 millions reads. The percentage of
reads of each sample was about the same and the 99% of each sample had an 8 fold
coverage.
We decided to start with the analysis of the coding regions. We proceeded by
applying different and consecutive filters. We removed the synonymous variants, the
variants already reported as segmental duplication or already reported in the SNP
database or in the 1000 genome project (tab.1). We found only 1 variant in Case#1
(tab.2). It was a non-synonymous variant occurred in the MED15 gene. Because we
didn’t find any mutation in the coding regions in Case#2 and #3, we proceeded with
the analysis of the genome data of the 22q11 region. We divided the data in 2 files,
one containing all the variants called by Samtools and the other one with the variants
called by Pindel. Again we applied different filters. We removed all the variants
outside of the patient’s deletion; the variants already reported as segmental
duplication or already reported in the SNP database or in the 1000 genome project
(tab.3). We found only 1 variant in Case#2 (tab.4). The mutation was located in a
non-coding RNA occurring between SEPT5 and GP1BB genes. In Case#3 we didn’t
find mutation.
In both Case#1 and #2, we confirmed the identified mutation by Sanger. For Case#1
we had the DNA from the mother but not from the father. The mother sequence was
normal and therefore we can’t define the mutation’s origin. For Case#2 we had DNA
from both parents and we confirmed that the mutation was inherited from the mother.

Discussion

By array CGH we have identified a 22q11 deletion in three patients with an atypical
phenotype. We defined the phenotype atypical because it was in part coincident with
the clinical features reported for the 22q11 deletion, but each patient had additional
physical characteristics not reported in the deletion syndrome. From literature we
know that the phenotype associated with the 22q11.2 microdeletions is highly
variable but to date, no consistent correlations have been detected between deletion
extent and phenotype. In addition, intrafamilial variability, even in monozygotic
twins, has been found. This suggests that other factors might be involved in the
expression of these malformations, including genetic and environmental factors
(Uliana 2007). Because our patients showed a classical 22q11 deletion we
hypothesised that one of the genes located in the 22q11 region can be mutated on the
non deleted allele and that this gene can be responsible for the additional clinical
features or that this gene was not directly responsible for the phenotype but altered
the expression of a second gene.
In Case#3 we found no obvious likely pathogenic mutation, but the analysis is still
ongoing. Case#3 was suspected for Cayler syndrome. The main characteristic of this
syndrome is the asymmetric crying facies, a minor congenital anomaly seen in 0.51% of newborns. It is caused by either agenesis or hypoplasia of the depressor anguli
oris muscle. This unilateral facial weakness is first noticed when the infant cries or
smiles, affecting only one corner of the mouth (Garzena 2000). However the Cayler
syndrome belongs to the group of conditions linked by microdeletion in the long arm
of chromosome 22 (Giannotti 1994).
In Case#1 we found a mutation in the MED15 gene. MED15 is part of the Mediator
complex (Blazek et al 2005). This complex is involved in the regulated transcription

79

of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. It serves as a scaffold for the
assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the
general transcription factors. The Mediator is characterized by the presence of 4
module termed head, body, leg and kinase. The head module is essential for
Mediator function, as mutations within it disrupt RNA polymerase II binding (Ranish
et al. 1999). The body complex confers structural integrity to the Mediator, while the
leg or tail region of Mediator seems involved in both activation and repression of
transcription. The kinase module is an additional subcomplex reversible associated
with the Mediator and has implicated in transcription repression. The MED15 is part
of the leg module.
In a not really recent study (Berti 2001), the authors demonstrated that MED15 was
expressed during embryogenesis with a high level in the frontonasal mass,
pharyngeal arches and limb bud. They suggest a role in the regulation of
developmental pathways underlying the morphogenesis of the derivative organs.
Because our patients showed polydactyly in both hands and both feet surgically
treated, the expression of MED15 in limb bud and its regulation function can be
involved in this clinical manifestation. Moreover, Kato et al. isolated the Xenopus
homologue of MED15 and demonstrated that was widely expressed during
embryogenesis with high level in neuronal tissue (Kato 2002).
In Case#2 we found a mutation in a non-coding RNA. It represents a natural
occurring read-through transcription between septin 5 (SEPT5) and glycoprotein Ib
beta polypeptide (GP1BB). It arises from inefficient use of an imperfect polyA signal
in the SEPT5 gene and is candidate for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).
Septins constitute a family of GTP-binding proteins implicated in a variety of
cellular processes from cell polarity to cytokinesis (Kinoshita 2001). In addition,
septins seems to regulate exocytosis in post-mitotic cells such as neurons and
platelets (Roeseler 2009). SEPT5 deficiency seems to exert pleiotropic effects on a
selected set of affective behaviours and cognitive processes as shown for SEPT5
knockout mice which demonstrated delayed acquisition of rewarded goal approach
(Suzuki 2009). Moreover the septin SEPT5/7/11 complex is critical for dendrite
branching and dendritic-spine morphology. Mutations in the GP1BB gene, together
with mutations in GP1BA and GPIX, seem instead involved in the Bernard-Soulier

80

syndrome (BSS) (Savoia 2010). GP1BB-deficient mouse model of BSS displays
macrothrombocytopenia and a severe bleeding phenotype, but no neurological
impairments. Our patient didn’t show a severe developmental delay nor the BSS
phenotype. Furthermore, from the encode data it appeared that the non-coding RNA
SEPT5-GP1BB was an highly conserved element that can represent an enhancer and
therefore can regulate the expression of a distal gene. To confirm this hypothesis we
have planned a luciferase assay.
Because of the presence of uterus and renal anomalies and the presence of a C2-C3
fusion, Case#2 was suspected for MURCS (Mullerian Renal Cervico-thoracic Somite
anomalies) association. The most common associated malformations of MURCS,
involve the upper part of urinary tract (40% of patients) and the cervicothoracic spine
(30-40% of patients) (Pittok 2005). The MURCS association may be attributed to
alterations in blastema giving rise to the cervicothoracic somites and the pronephric
ducts, the ultimate spatial relationships of which are already determined by the end
of the fourth week of fetal development (Duncan 1979). From literature we know
that the smallest common deleted region among the deletions overlapping 22q11.2
and associated with MURCS is the most frequent 3 Mb 22q11.2 deletion associated
with DiGeorge syndrome (Morcel 2011). This strongly suggests that the MURCS
association is an additional component of the 22q11.2 deletion phenotype. In order to
assess a correlation between the non-coding RNA mutated in our case and MURCS
association, we have collected 9 additional patients with MURCS in which test the
presence of the mutation.
In conclusion we have reported three patients with a 22q11.2 deletion and an atypical
phenotype and in two of them we have found a mutation. Both the probands can
present a deletion of chromosome 22 and, independently from it, additional clinical
characteristics. Alternatively, the atypical phenotype of these two patients can
represent an additional feature owing to the 22q11 deletion. Investigation of the gene
located within this interval will be important in the search for genotype-phenotype
correlation in future studies in this cytogenetic syndrome. However it stilled the
possibility that a gene responsible for the phenotype variability was located outside
of the 22q11 region or on a different chromosome.

5. DISCUSSION

84

Genomic rearrangements describe mutational changes that alter genome
structure (e.g., duplication, deletion, insertion, and inversion). These are different
from the traditional mutation caused by Watson–Crick base pair alterations. Each of
these rearrangements, excepting inversions, result in copy number variation (CNV)
or change from the usual copy number of two for a given genomic segment or
genetic locus of our diploid genome. Genomic rearrangements can represent
polymorphisms that are neutral in function, or may produce abnormal phenotypes.
The pathological conditions caused by genomic rearrangements are collectively
defined as genomic disorders (Lupski 1998 and 2009). Due to the limited resolution
of conventional cytogenetic techniques, the majority of genomic disorders were
missed in the past, because the genomic rearrangements were not cytogenetically
visible. However, high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)
techniques have revolutionized the approach to diagnosis of genomic disorders, and
enabled the screen of the entire human genome for CNVs. Therefore a growing
number of submicroscopical deletions and

duplications causing complex

neurodevelopmental disorders have been identified and recently the reciprocal
duplication syndromes have been reported for almost all microdeletion syndromes.
Many

of

the

known

microdeletion

syndromes

and

their

corresponding

microduplication syndromes occur on the basis of non-allelic homologous
recombination in low copy repeats.

Duplications or deletions of regions on chromosome 17 have been implicated
in a number of genomic disorders in humans (Lupski and Stankiewicz, 2005).
Chromosome 17 has the second highest gene content amongst all chromosomes. It
harbors several dosage-sensitive genes, including PMP22, PAFAH1B1,YWHAE,
RAI1, and NF1, which have been implicated in a number of genomic disorders
(Lupski, 2009). Genomic studies have elucidated the mechanisms underlying
genomic rearrangements in chromosome 17 and their contribution to the clinical
phenotypes. Based on NAHR mechanism, a CNV generation is the prediction that a
deletion can have a reciprocal duplication. Hence a genomic disorder caused by
deletion could, in theory, also have a corresponding duplication-associated disorder.
However, intrachromatid NAHR can only result in deletion and so the frequency of

85

deletion versus duplication is not equal, with a higher deletion frequency. Existing
knowledge supports the notion that the deletion phenotype is anticipated to be more
severe than the duplication phenotype. Decreased expression resulting from a gene
deletion causes a phenotype usually similar to that observed with loss-of-function
point mutations of a ‘‘dosage-sensitive’’ gene. Increased expression, resulting from
gene duplication may convey clinical findings that are different, and sometimes
divergent from the deletion phenotype (Bi 2009).
We reported two cases with a duplication of the Miller-Dieker region. Both
cases are the unbalanced result of two different balanced translocations:
t(9;17)(p24.2;p13.3) and t(10;17)(10q26.2;p13.3); and therefore their phenotypes are
more complex than the phenotype of cases with isolated 17p13.3 duplications (result
4.1). Previous studies highlighted that transgenic mice over-expressing PAFAH1B1
showed migration defect and reduced brain volume (Bi 2009). The last sign is also
present in humans since most patients showed microcephaly. Therefore, our data
confirm that PAFAH1B1 over-expression in humans does not cause neuronal
migration defects or other gross brain malformations. Comparing our cases with
those previously described in literature, it appeared that they share some facial and
physical features such as pointed chin, triangular face high nasal bridge and a
deceleration of head growth. Interestingly, recurrent respiratory infections during
childhood were reported in all patients. Since the 17p duplications of our patients
harboured from two unbalanced translocations, the phenotype is more complex
resulting by the combined effects of the duplication of the 17p13.3 region and of the
9p and 10q deletions. Nevertheless we contribute to further delineate the features
associated with this novel microduplication syndrome.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), typically apparent by the age of 3 years,
encompass a broad range of developmental disorders that are marked by limitations
in one of three behavioural/developmental domains: social interaction; language,
communication, and imaginative play; and range of interest and activities (Muhle
2004). The ASDs range from phenotypically mild to severe and include autism,
atypical autism, Asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorders. The
heritability of autism may as high as 90%, making it one of the most heritable

86

complex disorders. About 10% of cases are associated with a Mendelian syndrome
(e.g. fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex). There are two hypothesis
for the genetic aetiology of autism. The first theory, referred as the “common
gene/common disease” hypothesis, is that common diseases result from the additive
or multiplicative effects of genetic and environmental factors. Common genetic
variants confer only a small increased risk to a given individual, but because of the
high frequency with which these variants are found, each has a large attributable risk
among the population (Weiss 2009). An alternative to the “common gene/common
disease” hypothesis is that ASDs are caused not only by common variants of small
effect but also by rare highly penetrant variants such as chromosomal deletions and
duplications (Kusenda 2008). A substantial proportion of idiopathic autism may be
attributable to CNVs. Two recent studies detected de novo CNVs in 7–10% of
autistic cases from simplex families, 2–3% of cases from multiplex families, and in
1% of controls (Marshall 2008). These results not only implicate CNVs in the
aetiology of autism but also indicate that different genetic mechanisms may underlie
sporadic, versus familial, autism. Microdeletions and microduplications of
chromosome 16p11.2 have been found at varying frequencies among individuals
diagnosed with ASDs. Microdeletions are a more common cause of ASDs than the
reciprocal microduplication (0.50% vs. 28%, respectively) (Walsh 2011).
Microduplications seem instead strongly associated with schizophrenia (McCarthy
2009). Furthermore Walters et al; demonstrated that a 16p11.2 deletion give rise to a
strongly-expressed obesity phenotype. Possible explanations include a direct causal
relationship between obesity and developmental delay; the involvement of the same
or related regulatory pathways; or different outcomes of the same set of behavioural
disorders with complex pleiotropic effects and variable ages of onset and
expressivities (Walters 2010).
To test whether gene dosage accounting for obesity in carriers of the 16p11.2
deletion may also influence BMI in a converse manner, we assembled and
phenotypically analysed cohorts of duplications carriers (result 4.2). The duplication
was strongly associated with lower weight and lower BMI. Adults carrying the
duplication had a relative risk of being clinically underweight of 8.3. The duplication
was also associated with reduced head circumference, 26.7% presenting with

87

microcephaly, whereas carriers of the reciprocal deletion had an increased head
circumference. This suggests that head circumference and BMI may be regulated by
a common pathway, or that a causal relationship exists between these two traits in
these patients. To evaluate if the phenotypes observed in 16p11.2 deletion and
duplication individuals may be due to effects on the expression of genes mapping
within or near the rearranged region, we performed an expression assay in
lymphoblastoid cell-lines. Expression levels correlated positively with gene dosage
for all genes within the CNV, while genes proximal to the rearrangement showed no
significant

variations.

Therefore

as

in

the

schizophrenia/autism

and

microcephaly/macrocephaly dualisms, overweight/underweight could represent
opposite pathological manifestations of a common energy-balance mechanism.

The presence of a CNVs in a coding region usually correlates with changes in
the abundance of corresponding transcripts. Absence or excess of the protein product
of a dosage sensitive gene may influence cell differentiation or migration and tissue
formation early during development. In addition, genomic rearrangements may also
be associated with molecular mechanisms other than affecting transcript levels to
influence gene dosage and expression. Such complex mechanisms include gene
interruption, gene fusion, unmasking a recessive allele or silenced gene, and
interruption of regulatory gene-gene and chromosomal interactions (Lupski and
Stankiewicz 2005). Even before the completion of the Human Genome Project, the
pathogenic significance of gene dosage was realized in several disorders of the
central and peripheral nervous system.
Stankeiwicz et al. recently reported 24 cases with deletions and 17 cases with
duplications at 10q11.21q21.1. The only clinical features common to a majority of
individuals were ID and DD. Other clinical features identified include failure to
thrive, growth retardation, autism spectrum disorders, microcephaly, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, a CNV-phenotype association has not
been made for the 10q11.22 region and this CNV has not been classified as
pathogenic.
We recently reported that a small duplication on 10q11.22 including GPRIN2
gene, a regulator of neurite outgrowth, and PPYR1, a gene involved in energy

88

homeostasis, is a candidate modifier for Rett syndrome (Artuso 2011). Specifically,
duplications were found in the Zappella variant, the Rett variant with recovery of
speech, and lacking the typical growth delay, underweighting and autistic features.
Since PPYR1 knockout mice display underweight and reduced white adipose tissue
an over-expression of PPYR1 due to gene duplication may be responsible for the
higher body weight characterizing Zappella variant. We concluded that duplication at
10q11.22 may play a role in protecting from both underweighting and autistic
features in Rett patients (Artuso 2011). We now report more convincing evidences
that this microdeletion is probably clinically relevant and responsible for the ASD
phenotype, because significantly enriched in the ASD population when compared to
the SID/NSID population (p=0,001) (result 4.3). The duplication was observed also
in several controls, suggesting that the duplication by itself confers either no
phenotype at all or a range of phenotypes of varying severity. Moreover, because
genetic variation studies have reinforced the potential influence of PPYR1 on body
weight in humans (Sha 2009), we also demonstrated an increasing BMI value in
cases carrying the duplication. The highlighted examples demonstrate how gene
dosage effects may influence the development of common disorders often
characterized by heterogeneous genetic aetiology.

Other molecular mechanisms by which rearrangements of the genome may
convey or alter a disease phenotype result from how the rearrangement on one
chromosome affects or is affected by the allele on the other chromosome at that
locus. These include the unmasking of either recessive mutations or functional
polymorphisms of the remaining allele when a deletion occurs, and potential
transvection effects via deletion of regulatory elements required for communication
between alleles (Lupski and Stankiewicz 2005). Recessive genes reside within the
CNV regions, and the chances of finding a recessive mutation along with a
microdeletion are rare (frequency of spontaneous mutation x frequency of the
deletion event), but plausible. Profound sensorineural hearing loss has been reported
in patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome whose deletions unmask the recessive
mutation in the myosin (MYO15A) gene located within the 17p11.2 region (Liburd
2001). Functional polymorphisms within COMT and FXII, unmasked by hemizygous

89

deletions, have also been reported to result in cognitive decline and psychosis in
patients with 22q11.2 deletion and reduced activity of coagulation factor 12 in Sotos
syndrome respectively (Gothelf 2005, Kurotaki 2005). Additional example can be
represented by the thrombocytopenia absent radius (TAR) syndrome in which one
copy of the RBM8A gene is not functional, due to a null allele, and the expression of
the other copy is reduced, as a result of noncoding SNPs in the 5’ UTR or first intron
(Albers 2012).
We reported here our experience with three patient showing a 22q11.2
deletion and an atypical phenotype. In order to identify possible recessive alleles we
performed targeted sequencing of the 22q11.2 region. In one case we identified a
mutation in the MED15 gene, that is part of the Madiator complex (Blazek 2005).
This gene is highly expressed during embryogenesis with high levels in limb bud and
neuronal tissue (Berti 2001, Kato 2002). Therefore we hypothesize an involvement
of this gene in the polydactyly and severe intellectual deficit showed by our patient.
In a second case we identified a mutation in a non-coding RNA. Previous data
(Pennacchio 2006) revealed the high propensity of extremely conserved human noncoding sequences to behave as transcriptional enhancer in vivo, and supported both
ancient human-fish conservation and human-rodent ultraconservation as highly
effective filters to identify such functional elements. From the encode data it
appeared that the non-coding RNA SEPT5-GP1BB was highly conserved from
human to elephant. Therefore, it can represent an enhancer involved in the regulation
expression of a distal gene. To confirm this hypothesis we have planned a luciferase
assay. In the last case we found no obvious likely pathogenic mutation, but the
analysis is still ongoing. In conclusion we demonstrated that targeted sequencing of
genes within the pathogenic CNV region using the newly available technologies
would be useful to find potential candidate genes.

6. CONCLUSIONS and FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES

91

The conventional wisdom surrounding genomic disorders posits that they fit
several criteria: the deletions/duplications are large, highly penetrant, de novo in the
majority of individuals, and associated with a uniform constellation of clinical
features (Mefford and Eichler, 2009). Smith-Magenis syndrome, Prader-Willi
syndrome, and Williams-Beuren syndrome are examples of such “classic” genomic
disorders. In contrast to these “classic” genomic disorders, many of the more recently
described recurrent genomic lesions identified in large case–control studies
demonstrate apparently diverse phenotypes and are frequently inherited while
showing reduced penetrance (Klopocki et al., 2007; Mefford et al., 2008; Sharp et al.,
2008).
Several explanations have been proposed for the variable expressivity and
clinical heterogeneity in some genomic disorders. First, atypical or variable-sized
copy number changes may account for the variable phenotypes in some apparently
recurrent lesions. A “two-hit” model has also recently been proposed to account for
phenotypic variability. One hit may be sufficient to reach a threshold that results in
mild neurodevelopmental deficits, whereas a second hit is necessary for the
development of a more severe neurological phenotype. Alternatively, the abnormal
phenotype in patients with a heterozygous deletion can result from unmasking of a
recessive mutation or functional polymorphism of the remaining allele.
It is not clear to what extent such genomic changes are responsible for
Mendelian or complex disease traits and common traits, or represent only benign
polymorphic variation. Furthermore, some phenotypes caused by genomic
rearrangements may not present until late adulthood. This age-dependent penetrance
confounds the interpretation of genomic copy-number changes.
We know that rearrangements occur throughout the genome, and therefore it
is plausible to assume that such rearrangements or CNVs could be associated with
inherited or sporadic disease, susceptibility to disease, complex traits, or common
benign traits, or could represent polymorphic variation with no apparent phenotypic
consequences, depending on whether or not dosage-sensitive genes are affected by
the rearrangement. As demonstrated by this study, some genomic disorders show
highly variable penetrance that can make difficult the interpretation of molecular
results. The effective identification of such regions will likely require collaborative

92

efforts by multiple centres, in order to collect a sufficient numbers of patients
carrying the same structural variant. A cohort of multiple individuals with a
particular pathogenic variant will likely show at least some degree of phenotypic
concordance even where penetrance is incomplete, making possible a more defined
genotype-phenotype correlation.
For the future we plan to continue the consultation of the literature and the reevaluation of our cohort paying attention to the CNV regions to find new emerging
low penetrance syndromes. We also plan to use Next-Generation Sequencing of
selected regions or candidate genes to identified new recessive phenotype.

RESEARCH ACTIVITY
Identification of the genetic causes in patients with
intellectual disability, autism and multiple congenital
anomalies by array CGH analysis (Agilent platform) in
order to correlate new copy number variations (CNVs)
with a specific phenotype. Data analysis was performed
using the main bioinformatics databases (UCSC Genome
Browser, Ensemble, GeneCards, Database of Genomic
Variant, etc.). Patients data entry was added in the
Decipher database (http://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/) and in
the
Italian
Database
of
Human
CNVs
(http://gvarianti.homelinux.net/gvarianti/index.php).

November 2008-today
