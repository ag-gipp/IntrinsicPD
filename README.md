# Intrinsic_Plagiarism_Analysis
This project is extended version of plagcomps/plagapp tool developed by Noah Carnahan & co (http://www.cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/1314/dlibenno/final-results/plagcomps.pdf).
I have extended intrinsic plagiarism analysis module of this tool and updated with some new stylistic features and one additional outlier detection methods.
In the front end part, i have added some visualizations to make it more interactive to see the suspicious passages.
This extended tool is evaluated against vroniplag_medical test collections to measure the accuracy of stylistic features and created additional style models.The test collection contains all ground truths. Hence, it works as a framework to developers who are willing to test their new intrinsic plagiarism measures.
