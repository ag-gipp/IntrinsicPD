Introduction

Spreading depression (SD), is a physiological/pathophysiological phenomenon which manifests as a
propagating wave of neuronal hyperexcitability followed by a transient wake of depression, first
identified in the cerebral cortex of rabbits (Leao, 1944; Gorji, 2001). The SD phenomenon is exclusive to the central nervous system and appears to influence both the neuronal and the glial cells. SD
can be initiated by different stimuli and so can be directly studied in various in vivo and in vitro
experimental models. It was first induced by applying a brief tetanus of faradic stimulation to the
rabbit cortex (Leao, 1944; Bures, Buresova & Kriva´nek, 1974; Fig. 1). However, such stimuli
could lead to convulsive activity spreading from the stimulated area and so subsequent authors preferred to employ direct current (DC) stimuli (Leao & Morrison, 1945; Ochs, 1962). Mechanical
stimulation, for example, by stroking of the cortical surface with a blunt instrument, a falling weight
or even lightly tapping the cortex also initiates SD (Lea˜o, 1944; Zachar & Zacharova´, 1963). More
recent studies have achieved more reliable and reproducible induction of SD by rapidly inserting
and retracting hypodermic steel needles (Kaube and Goadsby, 1994; Lambert et al., 1999; Ebersberger et al., 2001). However, one of the most common models of SD initiation is KCl application
to the neuronal tissues (Wernsmann et al., 2006; Dehbandi et al., 2008). This model has been proven to be the most reliable stimulus leading to reproducible events on earlier occasions in both nonimaging and imaging studies (Martins-Ferreira et al., 2000; Bradley et al., 2001). In any case, changes in extracellular K+ concentration themselves might be involved in such pathophysiological
processes in human brain tissue (Mayevsky et al., 1996; Nicholson & Sykova, 1998).

Other methods of SD induction are including: (1) metabolic inhibitors such as NaCN and NaN that
poison oxidative metabolism and NaF and iodoacetate that primarily interfere with glycolysis; (2)
the Na+-K+ ATP-ase inhibitor ouabain has also been used in cortical brain slices; (3) applications of
the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate may elicit SD ; (4) local cooling may initiate SD
by depressing energy metabolism below a critical level but has proven an irreproducible experimental method. Furthermore, cooling itself raises the threshold for electrically or mechanically induced
SD.; (5) there are isolated reports of high-frequency electrical stimulation combined with the administration of pharmacological agents producing SD (Smith et al., 2006).

bioelectrical activities recorded from a rabbit during propagation of spreading depression
(SD). Traces reveal propagation of flattening epileptiform field potentials induced by spreading of cortical SD as well as spreading recovery of these activities.

SD probably starts with a cellular efflux of K+, leading to depolarization and a period of relative
electrical silence. The subsequent energy-dependent restitution of ion gradients eventually restores
normal neuronal activities. The ionic activity, however, results in a wave of neuronal depolarization
propagating away from the elicitation site at a velocity of 3 mm/min. Because the depolarizationrestoration process takes 1.5 min, the wave is only

5 mm deep (James et al., 2001).

SD involves a temporary localized redistribution of different ions between intracellular and
extracellular spaces. This ion redistribution is energy dependent. During eliciting of SD the
concentration of extracellular K+ [K+]o, rapidly rises (up to 60mM), causing brief neuronal
excitation then depolarization and a period of electrical silence during which DC potential at the
brain surface falls. In tandem, [Na+]o and [Cl−]o levels decrease as these ions enter cells.
Consequently, water enters cells, the extracellular space is reduced, and cells swell. Ca2+ ions also
move inwards, but slightly later than the outward movement of K+, suggesting that Ca2+ movements
follow K+ fluxes. Additional negative ion species move outwards to maintain electrical balance, the
excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate probably being the most important (Somjen et al., 2001).

7

No explanation of the propagation of SD has been suggested that accounts for all the facts presently
proven. The hypothesis that gained wide acceptance is that the spread of SD probably involves the
release and diffusion of the chemical mediators, most likely K+ and glutamate into the interstitial
fluid. In the isolated chick retina, human neocortical tissue and cat brain, NMDA receptor
antagonists block SD completely. By contrast, in rat hippocampus, glutamate and Ca2+ facilitate SD
initiation, whereas NMDA antagonists and low Ca2+]o delay its onset but fail to block SD
completely. Given the widespread potential signaling capacities of Ca2+ waves, observations of the
interactions between astrocytes and neurons in cell culture have suggested that Ca2+ waves play a
role in SD initiation and propagation.
Both volume-activated ion channels and glial cells probably play important roles in the restoration
of normal cellular homeostasis. The former are stimulated during cell swelling, and the latter provide spatial buffering that prevents increased levels of [K+]o and [Glu−]o during normal neuronal
activity. However, they might also prolong SD: volume-activated ion channels release glutamate
during SD; and although gliotoxins prolong SD, they also reduce glutamate efflux from glial cells.
SD appears more difficult to evoke in brains of larger animals in which the ratio of glia to neurones
tends to be higher, suggesting that glial cells are important for limiting SD activity. Such limiting
forces might be greater in the more complexly folded human brain, and could explain the paucity of
literature accounts of SD during neurosurgery.

1. Clinical relevance of SD

Processes similar to SD in animal cortex are thought to take place in a number of neuropathological
conditions in humans. These conditions include migraine with aura, brain trauma, ischemia/infarction, epilepsy, hemorrhage and transient global amnesia (see Gorji, 2001 for a recent review on clinical aspects of SD). Direct modulation of electrical activity of cortical neurons by the
locally spreading wave can lead to neurological symptoms (e.g. the aura phase of migraine). These
same neuronal processes can also alter the neurochemistry of subcortical structures, modulating
oxygen distribution, cell survival in these structures and behavior. This problem has not been addressed before, mainly because SD induces such a short depression in each cortical loci, that transient neurochemical changes cannot be examined with conventional approaches, for example by
microdialysis.

8

a) SD and migraine with aura
SD and migraine with aura: A few years before, Lashley (1941) explained the visual aura associated
with his own ophthalmic migraine attacks as bright scintillations moving across his visual field
leaving a blind area in his visual field. Mapping the trajectory of this scotoma across his visual field
gave a predicted velocity over a retinotopically organised visual cortex of approximately 3 mm/min
(Lashley, 1941; Milner, 1958). This report accordingly suggested a possible physiological mechanism for migraine aura in the visual cortex. Thus, one may suggest that the scintillations represent
the excitatory phase, while the pursuing blind spot is the inhibitory process of a SD event. Similar
conclusions were suggested from blood flow studies (Lauritzen, 1984) that demonstrated that the
oligaemia associated with the spread of SD from the occipital cortex showed a very similar propagation velocity to that of the SD itself. Magnetoencephalographic studies in human revealed that the
magnetic signals were seen in migraine patients but not in patients suffering from other forms of
headache or normal controls. Three distinctive signal patterns; suppression of spontaneous cortical
activity, slow field changes and large-amplitude waves, were observed strictly in migraine patients.
In some patients with migraine, magnetic signals were also recorded between attacks. The same
magnetic fields appeared during the propagation of SD in the cortex of anesthetized animals (Welch
et al, 1993). A recent study strongly supports the link between SD and the aura period in human
visual cortex. High-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to detect blood
oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) changes during visual aura in three migraineurs. A focal increase in BOLD signals developed first in extrastriate cortex and spread at the velocity of 3.5 ± 1.1
mm/min over occipital cortex. These initial BOLD features were consistent with scintillations and
paralleled by decreases in the stimulus-driven MR oscillations. Increasing in BOLD signals was
followed by a decrease in the mean MR signal. This phase appeared to correspond to the localized
scotoma and MR stimulus-induced response remained suppressed. Within 15±3 min, both BOLD
signals and MR stimulus-induced response recovered. During periods with no visual stimulation,
but while the subject was experiencing scintillations, BOLD signal followed the retinotopic progression of the visual percept. Spreading BOLD signal changes as CSD did not cross prominent
sulci (Hadjikhani et al., 2001). The most common symptoms during the aura phase in migraine are
visual. As mentioned, spreading oligemia and excitation wave of aura symptoms start in occipital
lobe and propagate anteriorly. Altering the ionic makeup of the extracellular fluid reversibly raises
or lowers the susceptibility to SD. Glial cells act as spatial buffer explicitly for potassium by taking
potassium up and carrying it from regions of high concentration to neighbouring regions of low
concentration. In human the lowest glial-neuronal ratio is in the primary visual cortex (Fig. 2; Gorji,
2001).

b) SD and epilepsy
SD and epilepsy: regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes in epilepsy have some similarities to
those changes in migraine. The human brain frequently has been observed during convulsive
seizure. An initial pallor preceding and during the early phase of epileptic attack was reported while
the latter part of the fit and post-convulsive state were accompanied by widespread vasodilatation of
cerebral vessels. The dilated vessels were first cyanotic, and then for several hours bright red.
Positron emission tomography shows a significant reduction of rCBF and oxygen consumption in
interictal period and an increased local blood flow in the ictal state in epileptic focus. The small but
significant reduction in both of those observed in cerebral hemisphere homolateral to the
hypoperfused and hypometabolic areas (Bernardi et al., 1983). Ictal scans revealed a focal or
multifocal increase in rCBF and oxygen consumption in an active seizure focus (Olesen, 1986).

10

SD is a well-known phenomenon in experimental epilepsy. SD has been observed in a variety of in
vitro and in vivo epilepsy models in different animal species. Reduction of extracellular Mg2+
concentrations, activation of NMDA receptors, blocking of K+ channels, e.g., by 4-aminopyridine,
increased extracellular K+, blocking of Na+–K+ ATPase, e.g., by ouabain, blocking of Ca2+
channels, e.g., by NiCl2, blocking of GABA receptors, e.g., by picrotoxin, are the common
pathways for eliciting epileptiform burst discharges and SD in experimental models (Gorji, 2001).
By all aforementioned mechanisms SD appears spontaneously between epileptiform ictal events.
SD can be elicited in susceptible area by a single discharge of an epileptic focus (spike triggered
SD). Epileptiform field potentials usually suppress during SD occurrence and reappear in few
minutes (Koroleva and Bures, 1983). CSD penetration into epileptic foci established in different
models of epilepsy. However, it should be noted that SD does not enter electrically or
pharmacologically elicited foci of epileptic activity with high rates of interictal discharges which
resulted in anomalous SD propagation. This abnormal SD conduction may account for periodic
changes of ictal and interictal activity found in some types of focal epilepsy (Koroleva and Bures,
1983). SD was observed in association with epilepsy in patients suffering from brain vascular
disorders (Fabricius et al., 2008).
c) SD and cerebrovascular diseases
SD and cerebrovascular diseases: SD was observed in patients suffering from brain
ischemia/infarction, brain haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage. The damage to cerebral
tissue depends on a complex series of physiological responses and degradative cellular cascades
involving a dynamic interplay among the various cells in the region of damaged tissue.
Experimental studies of focal ischemic stroke in animals and human support the concept that there
is a core of severe ischemia, the ‘ischemic core’ which is surrounded by a region of reduced
perfusion, the ‘ischemic penumbra’. Within the ischemic core, failure of oxygen and glucose
delivery leads to rapid depletion of energy stores and cell death. Central to the hypothesis of
neuronal salvage is the concept of the ischemic penumbra. The penumbra is an area which
metabolic capacity is suppressed but destruction is not yet inevitable (Olesen et al., 1986). The
etiology of progressive cell injury and death in the penumbra zone has been clarified in some
extent. Evidence suggests that SD plays a role in the ischemia–infarction tissue damage process.
Excitotoxicity results from excessive release and impaired uptake of excitatory neurotransmitter
glutamate. It is hypothesized that excessive amount of glutamate increases intracellular calcium
preferentially via NMDA-receptor-mediated channels. A profound increase in extracellular
potassium occurs in the ischemic core. There is a suggestion that the high potassium concentration
11

in the ischemic focus initiates diffusion of K+ into the adjacent normally perfused cortex and
triggers SD waves propagating from the rim of the focus to the surrounding intact tissue during the
early stages of focal ischemia (Nedergaard and Astrup, 1986). Local reduction of tissue glucose
content, caused by the increased demands and reduced supply of glucose in the area, might further
reduce the threshold for elicitation of SD. In subsequent minutes and hours, further SD waves can
be generated from the boundary of the focus provided that the chemical gradient is steep enough to
support sufficiently intensive diffusion of active substances into the intact cortex (Hossmann, 1996).
A SD wave initiated from a single point at the periphery of the focus spreads away from it but may
turn around and enter the penumbra zone in a different area of the focus. Generation of SD is
limited to an approximately 2-h period after ischemia, followed by a shorter interval of increased
SD susceptibility which disappear 3–4 h after the onset of focal ischemia (Koroleva et al., 1998).
Such SD waves significantly longer than those occurring in intact cortex and can be potentially
harmful because they are accompanied by additional release of glutamate and influx of calcium into
the neurons. In normal brain tissue, repeated SD waves do not induce any morphological or
metabolic damage. However, it is believed that when SD repeatedly collapses ionic gradients,
activation of NMDA receptors and gap junctions propagates SD and triggers a massive Ca2+ influx,
which in energy-compromised neurons is enough to initiate a cell death cascade (Somjen et al.,
1990). The tissue fully recovers when SD induced by elevating K+ in rat hippocampal slices, but in
slices that are metabolically compromised by oxygen/glucose deprivation, cellular damage develops
only where SD has propagated. After propagating SD in oxygen/glucose-deprived tissues, the
evoked CA1 field potential is permanently lost, the cell bodies of involved neurons swell and their
dendritic regions increase in opacity (Obeidat and Andrew, 1998).

SD can serve as a marker of normal function of SD-prone cerebral tissue. It disappears in cortical
regions in which neuronal density was reduced by ischemia and can be used for appreciation of
delayed recovery or deterioration in the penumbra zone after focal ischemia. Several studies showed
that in focal brain ischemia SD increases the ischemic volume. The pathogenic importance of periinfarct depolarizations for the progression of ischemic injury is supported by the close linear
correlation between number of SD and the duration of elevated potassium with infarct volume and
reduction of infarct size and neuronal loss in penumbra area by application of NMDA and nonNMDA receptor antagonist and by hypothermia (Mies et al., 1993; Mies et al., 1994).

2. Somatostatin
Since its discovery three decades ago, somatostatin has attracted much attention because of its
functional role in the regulation of a wide variety of physiological functions in the brain, pituitary,
pancreas, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, thyroid, adrenals, and immune system. Somatostatin actions
include inhibition of endocrine and exocrine secretions, modulation of neurotransmission, motor as
well as cognitive functions, cell proliferation, cell survival, angiogenesis, inhibition of intestinal
motility, absorption of nutrients and ions, and vascular contractility. In addition, the peptide
controls the proliferation of normal and tumour cells (Weckbecker et al., 2003). The biological
effects of somatostatin are mediated via high-affinity plasma membrane receptors, which are widely
distributed throughout many tissues ranging from the central nervous system to the pancreas and
intestine, and also in pituitary, lung, kidney, thyroid, and immune cells (Lahlou et al., 2004).

The mechanisms whereby somatostatin receptors transduce agonist-induced messages into
intracellular responses under different conditions and in different cells are complex. Somatostatin
receptors (sst1-sst5) are encoded by five different genes located on varied chromosomes. These
receptors activate a variety of intracellular signaling mechanisms and thereby regulate a complex
array of cellular functions. The biological effects of somatostatin are mediated through this family
of five G-protein coupled receptors with a high degree of sequence similarity and which have been
cloned in the early 1990s. They are encoded by five separate genes, located on five different
chromosomes, intronless except for sst2, which is alternatively spliced to generate two isoforms
named sst2A and sst2B observed mainly in rat and mouse. They all bind natural peptides,
somatostatin 14, somatostatin 28 and cortistatin with similar high affinity (nM range). Only sst5
displays a 10-fold higher affinity for somatostatin 28 (Patel, 1999). Because of naturally occurring
somatostatins have short half-lives in circulation (1–3 min), synthetic derivatives have been
designed to produce more stable compounds. Among the many hundreds of somatostatin analogs
that have been synthesized, two analogs are in common clinical use for the treatment of patients
with acromegaly and gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) endocrine tumors: octreotide and lanreotide. A
third, vapreotide (Sanvar®) which has been well characterized in preclinical studies for its negative
effect on cell proliferation is under clinical trials (Gonzalez-Barcena et al., 2003).

3. Somatostatin in brain
Somatostatin receptors express in various sites in the brain. Somatostatin is produced by
neuroendocrine neurons of the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. These neurons project
to the median eminence, where somatostatin is released from neurosecretory nerve endings into the
hypothalamo-hypophysial portal circulation. These blood vessels carry somatostatin to the anterior
pituitary gland, where somatostatin inhibits the secretion of growth hormone from somatotrope
cells. The somatostatin neurons in the periventricular nucleus mediate negative feedback effects of
growth hormone on its own release; the somatostatin neurons respond to high circulating levels of
growth hormone by increasing the release of somatostatin. It is also produced by several other
populations that project to other regions of the brain. In particular, there are populations of
somatostatin neurons in the arcuate nucleus, the hippocampus and the brainstem nucleus of the
solitary tract.
14

The boundaries of the neocortical areas can be determined by the distribution pattern of neurons
expressing somatostatin mRNA in rat neocortex. The occipital region was stratified, with intensely
labelled cells for somatostatin in layers II/III and VI and faintly labelled cells in layer V. The
parietal region carried a similar stratification, but more space between intensely labelled cells in
layers III and V and between layers V and VI gave the region a three-tiered appearance. The
temporal lobe displayed intensely labelled cells dispersed throughout layers III and VI and many in
layer V as well as those faintly labelled without any differences among the laminae. The
distribution of the cells hybridized for somatostatin mRNA formed two configurations within the
frontal region. It was difficult to identify any lamination in the first area, whereas the second area
demonstrated stratification reminiscent of the parietal region (Garrett et al., 1994).

Both excitatory and inhibitory activities have been associated with somatostatin in in vivo and in
vitro experiments. At the cell membrane level, however, the overwhelming evidence indicates that
somatostatin is an inhibitory neuropeptide. It inhibits cyclic adenosine 3-5-monophosphatase, block
calcium efflux, and open potassium channels (Jacquin et al., 1988). Excitatory activiactivity could
be due to presynaptic modulation of other inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmitters. The ionic
mechanism whereby somatostatin directly induces membrane depolarisation is unclear (Koch et al.,
1988; Scharfman and Schwartzkroin, 1988).

Somatostatin was suggested to be an effective therapy in many different neurological as well as
psychological disorders. Somatostatin was reported to express therapeutic effects in SD related
neurological disorders such as migraine (Goadsby, 2005), epilepsy (Binaschi et al., 2003), and
cerebrovascular disorders (Cervia et al., 2008). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
somatostatin on the characteristic features of cortical SD. Therefore, we investigated the effects of
different concentration of somatostatin on SD in rat neocortical tissues.

II. Material and methods
The experiments were performed on adult rat (250-350g) somatosensory neocortical slices. The
brain was removed under deep methohexital anaesthesia and placed in cold (1–4°C) artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) pre-equilibrated with 5% CO2 in O2 to give a pH of 7.4. The ACSF
contained (in mM): NaCl 124, KCl 4, CaCl2 1.0, NaH2PO4 1.24, MgSO4 1.3, NaHCO3 26 and
glucose 10. The somatosensory neocortices were dissected and cut into slices of 500

m thickness.

The slices were incubated in ACSF solution for >1 h at 28°C. After 30-min incubation, CaCl2 was
elevated to 2.0 mM. Slices were transferred to an interphase-type experimental chamber and
superfused with ACSF at 32°C (1.5–2 ml/min).
1. Electrophysiological recordings
Extracellular field potentials were recorded with glass microelectrodes (150 mmol/l NaCl; 2–10
M ) connected to the amplifier by an Ag/AgCl–KCl bridge in the third and the fifth layers of
neocortical tissues. Field potentials were traced by an ink-writer and recorded by a digital
oscilloscope.
2. Induction of neocortical SD

SD was elicited by KCl microinjection. A glass electrode filled with 2 M KCl was fixed in a special
holder connected with plastic tube to a pressure injector and the tip inserted into the sixth layer of
the neocortical slices. A high-pressure pulse was applied to inject an amount of K+ in the tissue sufficient to induce cortical SD (tip diameter: 2

m; injection pressure 0.5–1.0 bar applied for 200–

300 ms, two injections, 1–3 nl per pulse). Cortical SD-like events were evaluated with respect to
their amplitude, duration and velocity rates. SD duration was defined as the interval between the
time of half-maximal voltage shift during onset and recovery of the negative DC potential deflection.

3. Long-term potentiation

Single pulses of electrical stimulation were applied through a bipolar platinum electrode attached to
the white matter perpendicular to the recording electrodes. Evoked field excitatory postsynaptic
potentials (fEPSP) were recorded in the third layer of neocortical slices. The fEPSP was elicited by
adjusting the intensity of stimulation to 50% of that at which population spikes after fEPSP began
16

to appear. The amplitude of fEPSP 1 ms after the onset was measured for data analysis. In long-term
potentiation (LTP) experiments, the cortex was sequentially stimulated once every minute. Ten
trains of four pulses (pulse duration 0.1 msec; interpulse interval 50 msec; intensity 5 V) were
repeated at intervals of 10 msec. LTP was operationally defined as the mean change in fEPSP
amplitude in response to five stimuli given 30 min after tetanic stimulation compared with the mean
response to five test pulses applied immediately before the stimulation. Thus % potentiation =
[(posttetanus amplitude of fEPSP/baseline amplitude of fEPSP) 1] 100. Tetanic stimulation was
applied 60 min after application of drug.
4. Experimental protocols
The experimental protocol consisted of four periods as follows: (a) control period, neocortical slices
were superfused with ACSF (30 min), tested for spontaneous SD; (b) KCl injection, induction of
SD (SD1); (c) application of somatostatin (100-1000 nM) before the second injection of KCl (SD2);
(d) washout of somatostatin with ASCF (45 min, second control period), third injection of KCl
(SD3). Only a single concentration of somatostatin was used in a given slice. In control
experiments, DMSO (0.5%) was added to the bath solution after the first KCl injection (60 min) and
washed with ASCF (45 min) after the second and before the third KCl application.
5. Drugs
Somatostatin purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

6. Statistical analysis
All data are given as mean ± SEM. The data were statistically analysed using the Mann–Whitney
Rank Sum test. Multiple comparisons were performed by analysis of variance test (ANOVA) for
repeated measures followed by a Holm-Sidak’s test. Significance was established when the
probability values were less than 0.05. The investigations were approved by the local ethics
committee (Tierversuchsgenehmigung, Bezirksregierung Münster, Deutschland, AZ: 50.0835.1.0,
G79/2002).

III. Results
1. The effect of somatostatin on SD
Focal application of KCl in the sixth layer of neocortical tissues elicited negative DC waves
followed by positive waves (amplitude of 14.4 ± 1.6 mV; duration of 108 ± 4 sec). Negative DCdeflections were preceded by small positive waves in some slices. The cortical SD waves
propagated opposite to the direction of the ACSF flow at propagation velocity of 3.5 ± 0.2 mm /
min. The effects of four different concentrations of somatostatin (100, 250, 500, 1000 n ; n = 8 for
each concentration) were tested on KCl-induced SD in neocortical slices. The ratio between the
second and the first DC potential fluctuations (SD2/SD1) was calculated in control slices and slices
treated with somatostatin. Sixty minutes of somatostatin application at all concentrations did not
significantly change duration as well as velocity of SD. However, somatostatin at all concentrations
dose-dependently decreased the amplitude of negative depolarisation potential shifts occurring after
the second KCl application (SD2). Somatostatin decreased the SD amplitude to 30.1 ± 4.4 %, 59.2
± 10.6 %, 66 ± 6.6 %, 92.8 ± 4.7 % of the baseline level after application of 100 n , 250 n , 500
n ,1

M , respectively (Fig. 4; P ≤ 0.001; ANOVA test, Holm-Sidak’ method). After washout of

somatostatin, the amplitude of the negative DC waves (SD3) returned to the initial levels (SD1; Fig.
4).
2. The effect of somatostatin on LTP
A conditioning tetanic stimulation was delivered to the white substance of neocortical slices
followed by pulses with stimulation parameters identical to control values. The evoked fEPSP was
stable for at least 30 min before application of tetanic stimulation (less than 10% variation; Fig. 5).
Administration of tetanic stimulation produced a rapid and stable enhancement of the amplitude of
the fEPSP in all tested preparations (n = 6, 153 ± 10 % control; Fig. 6). LTP lasted as long as the
fEPSP were recorded (at least for 90 min). The potentiation rose within 1–2 min and stabilized
within 5 minutes after the train of stimulations. Application of somatostatin (500 nM; n = 12) sixty
min before tetanic stimulation significantly suppressed LTP induction in all tested slices (131 ± 4 %
baseline, Mann–Whitney Rank Sum test; P ≤ 0.001, Fig. 5).

IV. Discussion
The present study indicates a dose dependent suppression of the amplitude of the neocortical SD in
the presence of somatostatin. However, somatostatin did not change the duration and the velocity of
the propagation of SD. The data point to the involvement of somatostatin in initiation of neocortical
SD. Furthermore, administration of somatostatin significantly suppressed LTP. This indicates that
somatostatin modulates synaptic activities in rat somatosensory neocortical.
Somatostatin is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system and in the periphery (Epelbaum et al., 1994). Regional differences in the concentration of somatostatin and its receptors
have been found in the CNS, with the highest levels in the hypothalamus, cortex and limbic areas
(Epelbaum, 1986; Thoss et al., 1997). The demonstration of a neuronal, Ca2+- and tetrodotoxindependent release of somatostatin (Iversen et al., 1978; Lee and Iversen 1981; Vezzani et al., 1993),
its coexistence in neurons with classical neurotransmitters (Hokfelt, 1991) and its ability to affect
neuronal activity and ionic currents (Scharfman, 1993) suggest that this neuropeptide has neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator activities in the CNS. Somatostatin has been implicated in a variety of central functions ranging from neuroendocrine regulation to the control of cognition and locomotion, and changes in SRIF levels have been linked to numerous neurological disorders such as
Parkinson’s as well as Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, migraine, and cerebrovascular diseases (Epelbaum et al., 1994; Goadsby, 2005; Binaschi et al., 2003; Cervia et al., 2008).

Somatostatin system is activated during hyperexcitation of neuronal circuits. Although some early
studies suggested that somatostatin had augmenting actions on seizures (Higuchi et al. 1983; Perlin
et al. 1987), the hypothesis of somatostatin being acted as an antiepileptic substance originates from
the several evidences. 1. The peptide is preferentially released during high-frequency neuronal activities (Bartfai et al., 1988; Hokfelt 1991; Vezzani et al., 1993). 2. Marked changes in the expression of somatostatin mRNA, the levels of the peptide and its receptors occur after experimentally
induced epileptiform burst discharges (Pitkanen et al., 1986; Sloviter 1987; Marksteiner and Sperk
1988; Pérez et al., 1995; Piwko et al., 1996; Schwarzer et al., 1996) and in human epileptic tissue
obtained during epilepsy surgery (Perlin et al., 1987; Nagaki et al., 1988; de Lanerolle et al.,. 1989;
Deutch et al., 1991; Spencer and Spencer 1994). 3. Intracerebral injections of somatostatin affect
seizures and epileptogenesis in experimental animals (Perlin et al., 1987; Mazarati and Telegdy
1992; Monno et al., 1993; Piwko et al., 1996). The data indicate association between somatostatin
and epilepsy suggest that peptidergic systems may be an interesting target for pharmacological at-

23

tempts to control pathological hyperactivity in neurons, pointing out new directions for the development of anticonvulsant treatments (Vezzani and Hoyer, 1999).
Somatostatin has been shown to block the release of numerous vasoactive peptides, including
Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide e et al.(Fassler et al., 1990;
Helyes, 2001). Neurons containing somatostatin are found in the regions of the central and
peripheral nervous system involved in nociception, such as peripheral sensory fibres, dorsal horn of
the spinal cord, trigeminal nucleus caudalis, periaqueductal gray and the hypothalamus (Schindler et
al., 1997). Intravenous somatostatin (25 µg/min for 20 min) was compared with treatment with
ergotamine (250 µg intramuscularly), or placebo in a double-blind trial comprising 72 attacks in
eight patients (Sicuteri et al., 1984). Infusion of somatostatin reduced the maximal pain intensity
and the duration of pain to a level comparable with intramuscular ergotamine. In a randomized,
double-blind study subcutaneous somatostatin was compared with ergotamine (Geppetti et al.,
1985). Five patients were treated for three attacks by each of the drugs. Subcutaneous somatostatin
and ergotamine were equally beneficial as regards effects on maximal pain intensity and the pain
area, but somatostatin was less effective in reduction of the duration of headache. Octreotide, a
somatostatin analogue with a half-life of approximately 1.5 h has been reported as an anti-headache
substance. Episodic and chronic cluster headache response rate with subcutaneous octreotide was
52% while that with placebo was 36% (Matharu et al., 2004).

The primary cause of neuronal death in retinal diseases is ischaemia, a condition that can be
considered a final common pathway for injury in different retinal pathologies (Quigley et al., 1995;
Levin and Louhab 1996). The peptide somatostatin plays important physiological roles, mostly
inhibitory, which have formed the basis for the clinical use of SRIF compounds (Weckbecker et al.,
2003; Cervia and Bagnoli 2007), and it may protect the retina against ischaemia in a variety of
retinal diseases (Cervia et al., 2008). In non-neuronal cells, somatostatin has been shown to enhance
death ligand- and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (Guillermet et al., 2003), indicating that
conserved signaling pathways in programmed cell death can be influenced by somatostatin
receptors. Intracerebral applications of SSTR ligands before middle cerebral artery occlusion affect
the infarct volume in a dose-dependent manner (Rauca et al., 1999), suggesting that somatostatin
may influence neurodegeneration after brain ischemia. Activation and upregulation of somatostatin
receptors type 2 in perifocal pyramidal neurons after focal ischemia were reported. Upregulation of
these receptors is most likely the result of both somatostatin-derived and heterologous signals and
may counteract somatostatin desensitization. Excessive activation of somatostatin receptors type 2

24

in perifocal neurons by endogenous ligands is likely to account for the larger infarcts in wild-type
mice than in somatostatin receptors type 2 -deficient mice (Stumm et al., 2004).
SD is believed to play a crucial role in migraine with aura, cerebrovascular diseases, and epilepsy.
In the present study, somatostatin significantly suppresses neocortical SD. Several other antimigraine and anti-epileptic drugs such as Topiramate, valproate, propranolol, amitriptyline, and
methysergide also have inhibitory effects on SD (Ayata et al., 2006). Therefore, somatostatin may
express its therapeutic effects on abovementioned disorders by its inhibitory effects on neocortical
SD.

LTP is an experimental phenomenon, which can be used to demonstrate the repertoire of longlasting modifications of which individual synapses are capable (Collingridge & Singer 1990,
Malenka & Bear 2004). In the present investigations, neocortical slices perfused with somatostatin
exhibited a pronounced, persisting, and significant suppression of LTP. In hippocampal CA1 area,
somatostatin activates postsynaptic K+ currents in pyramidal neurons (Moore et al., 1988; Schweitzer et al., 1998) to hyperpolarize neurons away from their threshold for firing. Somatostatin inhibits
glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents at CA1 Schaeffer collateral synapses, while not
affecting GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (Boehm and Betz 1997; Tallent and Siggins
1997). In CA3, somatostatin inhibits excitatory postsynaptic currents generated at associational/commissural synapses (Tallent and Siggins 1999). In line with our results, it has been reported that is released during high-frequency activation of somatostatin containing interneurons and
acts to prevent LTP in lateral perforant pathway (Baratta et al., 2002). However some other studies
have suggested that somatostatin facilitates LTP at some synapses in the hippocampus. An in vitro
study in guinea pig demonstrated that SST augmented mossy fiber LTP in CA3 neurons (Matsuoka
et al. 1991). In dentate, a previous in vivo study in rat suggested facilitation by SST of medial perforant path LTP (Nakata et al. 1996). Several inhibitory neuropeptides depress LTP in different
brain structures. In vitro studies have shown nociceptin (Yu and Xie 1998), dynorphin (Terman et
al. 1994) to depress LTP at lateral perforant pathway synapses. These peptides likely have a presynaptic site of action in inhibiting glutamate releases, although they could also act postsynaptically
(Yu and Xie 1998). Neuropeptide Y inhibits N-type Ca2+ currents and Ca2+ transients in dentate
granule cells (McQuiston et al. 1996); thus, like somatostatin, this is a possible mechanism through
which this peptide could attenuate LTP.

SD induces an LTP-like effect in rat neocortical slices (Footitt and Newberry 1998) and facilitates
LTP induction in human neocortical tissues (Berger et al., 2008). Both inhibition of LTP induction
25

and SD generation were observed by drug manipulation in rat neocortical tissues (Muller et al.,
2006). Conversely, facilitation of LTP induction and enhancement of SD occurrence was observed
under both female hormones estrogen and progesterone application in rat somatosensory neocortical
tissues (Sachs et al, 2007). Modulation of LTP responses was also observed remote from the SD
propagation site in hippocampal tissues (Wernsmann et al. 2006). The inhibition of LTP after administration of somatostatin and reduction of synaptic efficacy may be responsible for its inhibitory
effects on SD.

V. Conclusion
Somatostatin receptors seem to be involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of different neurological and psychological disorders. Somatostatin therapeutic effects were observed in some SDrelated neurological disorders such as migraine and epilepsy. These therapeutic effects may be due
to its modulatory action on neocortical SD. Furthermore, present data indicate the importance of
somatostatin receptors in neocortical synaptic efficacy which may be involved in its suppressive
action on SD.
