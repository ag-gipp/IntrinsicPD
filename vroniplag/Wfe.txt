Although it was noted in 1924 by Murray Luck that the

human stomach contains abundant urease activity and it was shown in 1959 that
this activity disappeared after antibiotic treatment (indicating that the enzyme was
of bacterial origin), the connection between gastric urease and gastric spiral bacteria
was not established until the culturing of

H. pylori.

1.1.2 General characteristics
Helicobacter pylori

is a gram-negative, curved or slightly spiral, microaerophilic,

slow-growing organism. The most characteristic of it's enzymes is a potent multisubunit urease.

Geis et al.,

(

H. pylori is motile and possesses ve to seven sheathed polar agella

1989;

Josenhans et al.,

1995).

The bacterium's unique feature is its

ability to colonize the stomach.
Because of the relevance of this organism to human health, an eort was made
to sequence the genome.

in the United Kingdom, was the strain chosen for sequencing because it colonizes

genomes consist of a circular chromosome approximately 1.7

Mb in size. Of the 1590 predicted coding sequences, 279 genes were

H. pylori

spe-

cic. Some of these species-specic genes are thought to play an important role in
adaptation of

H. pylori

to the human stomach. The organism appears to have a lim-

ited metabolic and biosynthetic capacity. These characteristics are consistent with
those of an organism that colonizes a restricted ecological niche (

Tomb et al., 1997).

One interesting feature of the genome is that many predicted proteins, including
urease, are most closely related to corresponding proteins from gram-positive organisms, archaea, or eukaryotes, rather than from other gram-negative organisms

The discovery that

H. pylori

is associated with gastric inammation and peptic ulcer disease was initially met
with skepticism.

However, this discovery and following studies on

H. pylori

have

revolutionized our opinion of the gastric environment, the diseases associated with
it, and the appropriate treatment methods.

H. pylori

is probably the most common human chronic infection and is dis-

Go ,

Magalhães Queiroz and Luzza ,

Because of the worldwide prevalence of infection, transmission of the organism from
person to person is a major concern. Early studies demonstrated intra-familial clustering of infection, and more recently, DNA analyses of isolates have conrmed that
most transmission occurs locally within families or small population groups (

2006).

The study of the mode of trans-

mission is made dicult by the fact that, unlike other infectious diseases, there is
no well-dened clinical syndrome associated with its acquisition, and expression of
chronic

H. pylori

infection in humans is highly variable. Hence, the usual approach

of identifying cases and determining important exposures with infectious diseases

is not possible. Although most infections are asymptomatic, about 10% of cases of

H. pylori

colonization lead to illness.

H. pylori

is a major cause of chronic active

gastritis and peptic ulcer disease and is also an early risk factor for gastric cancer.
Infections are occasionally cleared spontaneously after a brief acute phase, but many
last for years or decades, and it is these long-term infections that are most often implicated in disease (

Kusters et al., 2006).

The persistence of the

H. pylori

infection

is surprising considering that the bacterium stimulates marked humoral and cellular
immune responses in the human host, which are insucient to clear the infection

Harry L. T. Mobley and Hazell , 2001; Suerbaum and Michetti , 2002).

(

1.1.4 Ecological niche
The means by which

H. pylori

occupies its gastric niche and the basis for its bio-

chemical capabilities and requirements is of great fundamental interest. A thorough
understanding of

H. pylori

physiology and metabolism could lead to new and better

drug therapies, to the identication of potential targets for therapeutic intervention,
or to an eective vaccine. Understanding how the organism colonizes and persists
in the host is an important step in fully understanding its pathogenesis.

H. pylori

have adapted to survive in the very specic and unique ecological

Lee and Josenhans ,

niche of the human stomach (

2005;

Sachs et al.,

2003;

Go ,

2002). Because of the presence of gastric acid which rapidly destroys the majority
of bacteria, the stomach is typically colonized only by transient oral ora.

H. pylori

appears to have evolved specic mechanisms to assist its survival in this hostile
environment. These factors include the ability to swim well in the thick, protective
mucus gel layer, the ability to transiently survive exposure to acid, and the ability to
attach to the epithelial cell layer to prevent the bacteria from being washed out of the
stomach through the mechanical action of peristalsis. As a result, other infectious
agents do not appear to successfully compete with

H. pylori

in this environment

Sachs et al., 2003).

(

Major non-specic host defenses against microbial colonization of the stomach
are gastric acid, peristalsis, and the continual shedding of the cells and mucus lining
of the gastric surface. This layer of gastric mucus, about 0.2-0.6 mm thick, is secreted

by epithelial cells and plays an important protective role in the stomach, both as a
lubricant and as part of the gastric mucosal barrier against acid and pepsin.

H. pylori

thrives in this mucus environment. The mucus layer forms a stable, continuous layer
over the mucosa and provides an environment for the neutralization of luminal acid,

Ferrero , 2005).

maintaining a near neutral pH at the mucosal surface (

According to studies employing light and electron microscopy and examination
of stained gastric biopsies,

H. pylori

can be found both in the gastric mucus and in

close proximity to the mucosal epithelial cells where it is protected from the acidic
environment of the stomach lumen (

Hazell et al., 1986; Liu et al., 2006).

1.1.5 Genetic diversity of Helicobacter
H. pylori

isolated from dierent patients and examined by various high-resolution

typing methods, including ribotyping, restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP), and random amplied polymorphic DNA (RAPD) ngerprinting indicate
that nearly every strain is unique at the DNA level (

1992;

diversity reects large eective population size as well as a high mutation rate.
Recombination is relevant because it reduces the eect of selective sweeps, increasing
eective population size. In addition to point mutations that are unique to individual
strains, large gene clusters are present in some strains but not in others (

A total of 275 (18.4%) J99 and 290 (18.7%) 26695 gene products have orthologues

As with several other bacterial species, including

and

This property allows for the uptake of exogenous

In addition to genetic exchange

strains may exchange DNA via a contact-dependent

mechanism resembling bacterial conjugation.

H. pylori

has an overall high mutation rate; in addition it has 46 genes con-

taining homopolymeric runs of nucleotides or dinucleotide repeats. These genes are
susceptible to frequent length changes due to slipped-strand mispairing-mediated
mutagenesis.

Reversible inactivation of genes could occur due to frameshifts sec-

ondary to length changes (phase variation), or if the repeat is located in regulatory
sequences, dierent gene transcription could occur. The large repertoire of hypermutable genes would mean that any large population of

H. pylori

will consist of

many dierent subpopulations, each subpopulation with a specic combination of
active and inactive phase-variable genes (this phenomenon has been described by
the term `bacterial quasispecies'). The inactivation of some genes containing hypermutable sequences is likely to be selected against in vivo, however, various research
has shown that intrastrain recombination and slipped-strand mispairing mediated
mutagenesis generate highly diverse populations of

H. pylori

in an individual host.

This would enable the bacterial population to respond rapidly to changing environments by expanding a particular subpopulation with higher tness. This mechanism
could also permit the bacteria to regulate their mutation rate, as the antimutator
gene

mutY

contains a repeat sequence in which length variation could lead to gene

inactivation (

It is possible for genetic variation within parasite populations to provide information relating to their evolution. Despite this it is uncommon for this variation to
contribute to the understanding of their hosts' evolution however some examples do
exist; for instance

Funk et al. (

2000) predicted that if pathogens are not transmitted horizontally between

eukaryotic hosts, a phylogenetic evolutionary parallel of host and pathogen genomes
could be envisaged. They have shown that the phylogenies of these endosymbiotic

Hence, it is possible to

utilise the genetic diversity of a pathogen to reect the evolutionary history of its
host. However, most bacterial pathogens are frequently transmitted between hosts,
separating the co-evolution of bacterium and host. Recently though,

atpA: ATPases (or ATP synthases) are membrane-bound enzyme complexes/ion

transporters that combine ATP synthesis and/or hydrolysis with the transport of
protons across a membrane. ATPases are able to utilise the energy from a proton
gradient, using the movement of ions across the membrane via the ATPase proton
channel to drive the synthesis of ATP. Some ATPases work in reverse, harnessing

the energy from the hydrolysis of ATP to create a proton gradient. Dierent types
of ATPases exist, they can dier in function (ATP synthesis and/or hydrolysis),
structure (F-, V- and A-ATPases contain rotary motors) and in the type of ions
they transport.

The microbial inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase) plays an important

role in macromolecular biosynthesis and is essential for the viability of

coli

Escherichia

and yeast. The protein appears to be universal and is highly conserved amongst

diering species. Inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase) is the enzyme responsible for
the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi) which is formed principally as the product
of the many biosynthetic reactions that utilize ATP. All known PPases require the
presence of divalent metal cations, of which magnesium confers the highest activity.
Among other residues, a lysine has been suggested to be part of or close to the
active site. PPases have been sequenced from bacteria, thermophilic bacteria, from
archaebacteria, from fungi, from a plant, and from bovine retina.

The sequences

of PPases share some regions of similarities, including a region that contains three
conserved aspartates that are involved in the binding of cations.

Tryptophane (Trp) is biochemically the most expensive of the amino

1.2 African population genetics
Experiments on genetic markers such as MtDNA, Y chromosomes and Y chromosome SNPs have shown that Africans have greater genetic diversity than non
Africans.

Several factors have been implied, including a larger eective size for

African populations (

Eller ,

2001); an older onset of population demographic ex-

pansion in Africa combined with larger eective size (

Relethford and Jorde , 1999),

population size uctuations and periodic extinctions of populations outside Africa

Eller , 2002), or positive selection through adaptation to new environments outside

(

Africa (

Excoer , 2002).

Linkage Disequilibrium (LD), the tendency of alleles located close to each other
on the same chromosome to be inherited together, has been conrmed to be lower

Reich et al.,

in African than non African populations (
Goldstein & Weale (

2001;

Gabriel et al.,

2002).

Goldstein and Weale , 2001) used a simulation approach asking

why the patterns are so dierent, and have found that admixture does not fully
explain this diversity, and hence genetic bottlenecks that aected Europeans and
not African populations.

Larger eective sizes for African populations have also

1.2. African population genetics
been suggested (

Frisse et al.,

14

2001) as a cause for the dierence in LD between

African and non African populations.

1.2.1 Mitochondrial DNA (MtDNA)
In paleoanthropology, the recent single-origin hypothesis (RSOH, or Out-of-Africa
model, or Replacement Hypothesis) is one of two inuential accounts of the origin of
anatomically modern humans, Homo sapiens. According to the RSOH, anatomically
modern humans evolved in Africa between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, with
members of one branch leaving Africa between 55000 to 80,000 years ago.
MtDNA is an excellent marker for characterizing diversity and evolution due to
its lack of recombination and maternal inheritance. The three main haplogroups,
which are found only in Africa are L1, L2, and L3. Of interest and greater prevalence
in East Africa is L3, where it accounts for about half of all types from this region.

Watson et al., 1997;

This frequency prole suggests an origin for L3 in East Africa (

Forster , 2004).

This is supported by the evidence that the out-of-Africa migration,

which took place from a source in East Africa 60,000-80,000 years ago, gave rise only
to L3 lineages outside Africa. Also of interest is Haplogroup Pre HV with lineages
occurring widely in the Middle East, but also appearing in Ethiopia and Somalia.
The greater diversity in the Middle East suggests that the group originated in that
region and subsequently spread to the African continent (

Lovell et al., 2005).

The macro-Haplogroups M and N are a branch of the African haplogroup L3
and span many continents.

They are believed to have originated in Africa some

80,000 years before present. Both haplogroups are believed to represent the initial
migration by modern humans out of Africa. Haplogroup M particularly represents
the dispersal of modern human into Eurasia some 60,000 years ago along the Southern Asian coastline.

Owing to its old age, haplogroup M is one of those mtDNA

lineages which does not correspond well to present-day racial groups, as it spans
East Asian, South-East Asian, South Asian, Amerindian, as well as Ethiopian and

Salas et al.,

various Middle Eastern groups in lesser frequency (
al (

2002). Kivisild et

Kivisild et al., 2004), who compared mtDNA between Ethiopians and Yemenis,

have found them both to contain similar proportions of subclades M & N (Eurasian

1.2. African population genetics

15

specic), and African specic lineages. The Eurasian subclades found in Ethiopia
suggest backward migration and intermixing with Western Eurasian ancestors and
East Africans, although this has been evident only in certain groups (the Amhara
and Tigriani).

Krings et al., 1999) have studied mtDNA along the Nile basin:

Krings et al (

Their

study involved the hyper-variable (HV) region. They found increased variability of
the HV region in the north of the basin, and higher MtDNA variability at Southern
Sudan; which lead to the conclusion that although migrations have occurred bidirectionally, it has either been earlier or to a lesser extent on a North to South
gradient.
Analysis of MtDNA from 58 individuals from a sedentary population from Gurna,
Egypt has shown that this group maintained a similar prole to that of groups in

Stevanovitch et al., 2004).

East Africa, further supporting origins in East Africa (

1.2.2 Y Chromosome
Study of the Non Recombining Region of the Y chromosome (NR Y) is a valuable

Underhill et al.,

tool for determining the paternal lineage. Underhill et al (

2000),

comparing the NR Y of 1062 individuals from dierent regions, have found three
mutually reinforcing mutations (two transversions and a 1-bp deletion), distinguishing a haplogroup, which is represented today by a minority of Africans, mainly
Sudanese, Ethiopians and Khoisans.

All non-Africans, except a single Sardinian,

and most African males sampled carried only the derived alleles at the three sites.
This implies that modern extant human Y chromosomes trace ancestry to Africa
and that the descendants of the derived lineage left Africa and eventually replaced

Seielstad et al.,

archaic human Y chromosomes in Eurasia. Mark Seielstad et al. (

1999) have found that there is greater diversity in Y chromosomes in Africans and
have attributed this to a greater diversity within African populations rather than
a larger eective size.

Y chromosome analysis has also supported a relationship

between East Africans and Khoisans (
as well as Eurasians.

1.2.3 Migration routes out of Africa
Assuming only relatively recent migrants from Africa gave rise to today's nonAfrican humans, there could have been more than one migration that left descendants. Two routes for the migration out of Africa have been assumed (

Matsumura , 2005).

Forster and

The rst and most obvious route is from Egypt, across the Sinai

into the Levant. This route is confronted by the major obstruction of the arid zone
of the Sahara and Sinai deserts, and thus tends to be only passable during the short
periods of interglacial optimum when the Sahara is covered by fresh water lakes,
rivers and abundant game. The second route only opened when sea levels fell; it
is across the Bab-el-Mandeb, between Yemen and Djibouti. This route too is obstructed by a barrier, the Red Sea and its hazardous reefs, and so is usually only
opened when there is a major fall in sea levels.

At the times at which sea levels

were low, this area is also one of high aridity, probably keeping a beachcombing human population close to the ancient shorelines, which are now well below sea-level,
making the nding of early human fossils there very dicult.

Figure 1.1: Migration routes out of Africa (

Forster and Matsumura , 2005)

1.3. Sudan

17

Genetic evidence suggests that humans departed Africa only once. The mtDNA
M and N haplogroups are derived from haplogroup L3, and they both suggest a single exit from Africa. The distribution of the M158 Y chromosome haplotype of the
"Eurasian Adam" indicates a similar history, dating the period between 30-79,000
years ago. During the period in which it is thought (on genetic evidence) humans
left Africa, between 55,000 and 85,000 years ago, paleoclimatological evidence suggests that a vast belt of desert stretched from the West African Atlantic border to
the Eastern Siberian Pacic border. These deserts conned humans south of that
line, and reduced the food returns to cultures based exclusively on grassland and
woodland based hunter gatherer technologies. The M haplogroups seems to support
the existence of this barrier. The fall in sea levels at the time opened up the second
route out of Africa, and the growth of a beachcombing lifestyle, conrmed at the
perched coastline shell-middens at Zuli Bay, allowed additional dietary supplements,
in the form of hunting large game and with highly nutritious shellsh.
Low glacial sea levels at this period would have been the rst time in millennia
that permitted a dry crossing from the Gulf of Aden to the islands East of Java
facing Australia.

YAP

Among Y-chromosomal haplogroups, the M130 and the M174

gene haplogroups in particular support this hypothesis as their path follows a

great arc along the shorelines of Saudi Arabia, India, South East Asia and Australia.
This beachcomber society moved on through Southern China and Taiwan to Japan
and Eastern Siberia. Approximately 8-10,000 years ago the M130 haplogroup was
carried by Na-Dené speaking peoples into the North West Pacic coast of America

Forster , 2004).

1.3 Sudan
1.3.1 Geography
Sudan is located in Northeastern Africa. It borders the Red Sea between Egypt on
the North and Eritrea and Ethiopia on the Southeast; while Chad and the Central

1.3. Sudan

18

African Republic are located on the West. The total area of the country is 2,505,813
square kilometers. The length of Sudans borders is 7,687 kilometers. The bordering countries are the Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libya, and Uganda.
The country in general is a broad, at plain, with low mountains in the Northeast
(near the Red Sea coast), in the West, and on the Southeast.

A group of low

mountains in the south-central region are known as the Nuba Mountains. The Nile
River divides the Eastern third from the Western two-thirds of the country. In the
North, the Nubian Desert lies to the east of the Nile and the Libyan Desert to
the West. The two areas are stony, virtually rainless, and dune-covered. South of
the central area, vegetation gradually changes from dry grassland and woodland to
verdant savannah.
The Nile is the dominant geographic feature of Sudan, owing for approximately
3,000 kilometers from Uganda in the South to Egypt in the North. Most of the country lies within the Nile's catchment basin. The Blue Nile originating in the Ethiopian
higlands and the White Nile from the Central African lakes, join at Khartoum to
form the Nile River proper that ows to Egypt. Other major tributaries of the Nile
include Bahr al Ghazal, Sobat, and Atbarah rivers.
There has been no comprehensive census in Sudan since 1983. The most recent
survey occurred in 1993, which produced a population gure of 24.9 million, but
it omitted the South because of insecurity. In 2003 the United Nations Population
Division estimated Sudans population at 33.6 million, a gure similar to other estimates. According to the United Nations, the annual growth rate was 2.8 percent.
The United Nations estimated the population density at 13.4 persons per square
kilometer, which is a misleading measurement since half of the population lives on
approximately 15 percent of the land, and the Northern third of the country is quite
thinly populated. Estimates of urbanisation ranged from 31 percent to 37 percent,
with the highest concentration in the greater Khartoum area. The capital, suered
from a very rapid population expansion secondary to migratory factors rather than
an increase in local birthrate.

The years 1984-2006 showed massive inux of mi-

grants from the Western and Southern parts of the country as a result of the civil

war and natural disasters (CIA wold fact book).

1.3.2 History
Northern Sudan was inhabited by hunter-gatherers by at least 60,000 years ago.
With the advent of pastoralists, these people had given way to them and probably
to agriculturalists at least by the fourth millennium B.C. Sudan's subsequent culture
and history have largely revolved around relations to the South with tropical Africa,
and to the North with Egypt, the Nile River forming a bridge through the Sahara
Desert between the two. The Ancient Egyptians sent military expeditions into Nubia, and at times occupied it as well as Cush, the land between the second and sixth
cataracts, inuencing the population of the North. From the early eighth century
to the mid-seventh century B. C., the Cushites conquered and ruled Egypt. By the
early sixth century B.C., the Cushitic state of Meroe had emerged and it eventually
extended southward almost to present-day Khartoum. Meroe was in a good position
for trade, as trade passing North to Egypt stopped there. The Meroites also had a
route to and from the Red Sea, and, on the Red Sea, trade was increasing to and from
India and East Asia. Meroe also maintained commercial relations with the Roman
world, developed a distinctive culture and written language, and became the locale
of an iron-working industry.

It succumbed to invasion in the mid-fourth century

A.D., their Conquerors being the neighboring Aksum kingdom, based in Ethiopia.
By the sixth century, three states emerged as the political and cultural heirs of the
Meroitic kingdom. They were all ruled by warrior aristocracies who converted to
Christianity, accepting the Monophysite rite of Egypt. The use of Greek in liturgy
was encouraged by the church and eventually gave way to the Nubian language. Arabic, however, gained importance after the seventh century, especially as a medium
for commerce, after the expansion of the Muslim empire. With the disintegration of
the Christian Nubian kingdoms by the fteenth century, Islamic culture and religion
spread throughout Northern and Eastern Sudan. Pastoralists from Egypt advanced
into the land, gradually giving rise to a new population composed of local Nubians

Ethnic groups

Ethnic identity is highly uid in Sudan and depends upon the criteria by which
individual groups of Sudanese distinguish themselves from other groups. The largest
and most commonly recognized ethnic groups are the Arabs, Nubians, Beja, and Fur
(all Northerners and Muslims), and the Dinka, Nuer, Shilluk, and Nuba, all Nilotic
peoples of the South. The Arabs and Dinka represent the largest groups within their
respective regions. All of these ethnic groups are further subdivided into tribal or
other units.

In rough percentages, Sudans population is composed of 50 percent

black Africans, 40 percent Arabs, 6 percent Beja, and 34 percent other.

About

570 tribes which have been grouped into 56 ethnic groups on the basis of linguistic,
cultural and other ethnological characteristics currently exist (

1.3.3.2

Tvedt , 2004).

Language groups

More than 140 languages are spoken in the Sudan (Ethnologue). These languages
relate to three of the four of Greenberg's African language families: i.e. the AfroAsiatic, the Niger-Kordofanian (Niger congo-a) and the Nilo-Saharan families (

reiz , 1968).

Population genetics

Not much work has been performed on the population genetics of the dierent
Sudanese populations. Most of the work involved research on genetic blood markers,

such as typing of haemoglobin and serum proteins. (
1988;

Saha and el Seikh , 1987).

The results of these works have identied dierences

between the African groups and those that claim Semitic origin, although African

markers, such as the sickle cell gene have also been identied in variable frequencies.
Conicting results have also been shown, with characteristics of certain African
tribes similar to some of Arab descent, and some of Arab descent similar to Africans

Saha and el Seikh , 1987).

In a global MtDNA analysis (

2002), the Sudanese groups clus-

Underhill et al.

who looked at the

Y-chromosome of African individuals, have also placed Sudan along with Ethiopia
on a group of their own.

Again, no further subdivisions have been made within

the examined Sudanese population, although groups representing all the language
families have been examined (personal communication, P. Underhill).

The project will build on existing work (

Achtman et al.,

Falush et al., 2003a; Wirth et al., 2004) by using the same multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) scheme. This will allow the bacteria from Sudan to be compared with a
global collection, currently consisting of over 700 strains. This Sudanese project will
in particular address the important question of diversity in Africa. Africa represents
the birthplace of modern humans, and so unraveling the diversity of
Africa might allow us to understand the origin of

as well as allowing us

to address questions specic to Sudan. Questions to be addressed include:
(1) Do dierent Sudanese ethnic groups, as characterised anthropologically, harbour dierent populations of bacteria and if so, what does this tell us about the
origin of particular Sudanese ethnic groups.
(2) Ancestral H. pylori population AE2 (ancestral Europe2) population seems to
have arisen in the Nile Valley area. Is this expectation conrmed by a large sample
of bacteria?
(3) A very divergent Africa2 population has been found in South Africa, although its ethnic origin is currently mysterious. Do similar divergent bacterial pop-

Materials and Methods
2.1 Gastric biopsies
Gastric biopsy specimens were obtained from 200 consecutive patients undergoing
diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in four district hospitals in the Khartoum area during the period from 1-November-2004 until 1-August-2005. Ethical
approval for the project was obtained from the Federal Ministry of Health, Sudan
(23/Jul/2005), and informed consent was obtained from all subjects participating
in the study. One endoscopic biopsy sample was obtained from the antral mucosa
within a 5 cm radius of the pylorus. The samples were transported in aliquots containing 1.5 ml of brain heart infusion medium (Oxoid CM 225), yeast extract (Oxoid
L21) and 20% glycerin in a cold box to the laboratory. Transport from the hospitals
to the laboratory averaged 3 hours.

2.2 Sheep gastric DNA samples
DNA was extracted from the abomasum of 15 sheeps stomachs; obtained from the
slaughter house of Khartoum North. Ethical approval (13/Aug/2006) was obtained
from the research and ethics committee of Elrazi College of Medical and Health
Sciences to work with the sheeps DNA. The DNA was extracted using a QIAamp
DNA minikit following the tissue extraction protocol.

and incubated at 37.5 C for 48-72 hours in a gas jar containing microaerophilic sachets (Biomerieux or Oxoid). Identication of the bacteria was made on the basis
of both microscopic and biochemical properties, including gram stain, urease test
and oxidase test. Single colonies were isolated and further propagated. From a well
grown plate (not older than 3 days), bacteria were harvested from a half plate with
a cotton swab and placed in the storage medium aliquots, appropriately labeled and

Data analysis was performed by the following software:
a. Chromas V. 2.31 (Technelysium Pty Ltd, Australia), was used for viewing
the sequences and selecting traces for further analysis and storage.
b. Bionumerics V 4.50, (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium)
The sequences were uploaded into Bionumerics, and added to a global database.
Using the functions of the program, the sequences were checked for consistency; and
consensus trimming for the desired gene length was performed. Cluster analysis and
sequence alignment were also perfomed using the provided model in Bionumerics.
Exports were made from Bionumerics to all other necessary formats for analysis,
such as Phylip, Mega, and Structure.

Figure 3.1: Distribution of isolates within Sudan

Due to the ongoing war in Sudan, tertiary hospital care is only available in
the capital, and there is only one other town where upper gastrointestinal (GI)
endoscopies are carried out. Patients from all around the country are usually referred

to one of three gastrointestinal centers in Sudan. Due to the fact that most gastritis
patients suer only mild disease, the majority of patients presenting to the GI centers
are referred for upper GI bleeding. Only a third of patients are for OGD for gastritis.
The reported incidence of

H. pylori

in Sudan was 80% (

Azim Mirghani et al.,

1994), and the culture recovery rate from biopsies has been reported between 50 and
70% in experienced labs (

Loeld et al., 1991; Grove et al., 1998).

incidence we were able to isolate

Helicobacter pylori

Despite this high

from 33% of collected biopsies.

Several possible explanations have been proposed for the low isolation rate.
Increase of antibiotic intake by patients is the most likely explanation, as most
patients who arrive to tertiary hospitals where endoscopic diagnosis is available,
would have already consumed a variety of antibiotics, as restrictions on medications are minimal and most antibiotics are sold over the counter, regardless of their
potency.
Transport conditions could have also aected the recovery rate, as sample transport time from hospital to laboratory averaged 3 hours, although the samples were

o

transported in the recommended media, the high temperatures (reaching 45 C)
could have reduced the isolation rate.
The samples that were isolated represented the 3 language families available
in Sudan and various geographic areas (i.e. NiloSaharan, Afro Asiatic and NigerCongo).

3.1.2 Multiple strains from same patient
Eight patients volunteered more than one biopsy for the study. Multiple isolates were
obtained from the dierent biopsies. RAPD PCR (g 3.2) was performed for these
multiple isolates to identify dierences. The multiple isolates were also sequenced
and sequences of seven of them were dierent in at least one sequenced gene, and
one patient carried two identical strains. The eight paired biopsies showed closely
related strains, as large portions of the sequences were identical in each pair. Three
of the paired isolates contained only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This
could reect mutations or short imports. Three pairs of isolates diered by multiple
nucleotide exchanges at one or two of the gene fragments and are likely to reect import of sequences from other bacteria during mixed colonization. One other pair had
related isolates, but so many loci were polymorphic that some polymorphic stretches
may reect more than one import. And one pair of isolates was identical. A diagram
of the polymorphic sites and their locations in the collection of concatenated genes
was created using Happlot (g3.3).

The results of the polymorphic sites between

Falush et al.,

paired isolates was similar to that in previous studies (

2001). They

found that the majority of their paired isolates contained no sequence dierences
(13), while three pairs of isolates contained only single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) that might reect mutations or short imports and six pairs of isolates differed by multiple nucleotide exchanges at one or two of the gene fragments and are
likely to reect import of sequences from other bacteria during mixed colonization.

Sequences were obtained from fragments of seven housekeeping genes scattered
around the chromosome and analyzed for 529 strains in addition to the 69 strains

from Sudan. After aligning the sequences, none of them contained gaps or insertions.
The GC content range for the seven genes analyzed in the Sudanese strains was
similar to that previously reported; ranging from 39%-46%.
Substitutions which lead to amino acid replacements are termed nonsynonymous
while substitutions that do not cause an amino acid replacement (such as a GGG to
GGC change, as both codons still encode glycine) are termed synonymous substitutions. Synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions can result in dierent eects
on the physiology of the organism, and hence can have very dierent dynamics.
Using the program DnaSP we calculated the average number of nucleotide dif-

ferences per site between the sequences, Pi (

1987), the nucleotide

diversity using the Jukes and Cantor correction, and the average number of nucleotide dierences, K (

Tajima , 1983).

Nonsynonymous sequence variation (Ka) was uncommon in our data set, Ka
for the concatenated genes was 0.63%.

All the Sudanese sequences showed high

levels of synonymous sequence variation (Ks) with a mean percentage Ks value for
the concatenate genes of 10.2%, and the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous
polymorphisms was 16.4. This was in agreement with previous reports, indicating
that the mutation rate in the Sudanese strains is similar to those previously reported

Achtman et al., 1999).

(

The sets of sequences were also tested by the homoplasy test. This test analyses the apparent homoplasies among informative, synonymous polymorphic sites.
When the same site changes twice in the ancestry of a set of sequences homoplasies
occur. The frequency of apparent homoplasies, as measured by the homoplasy ratio,

Maynard Smith and Smith ,

indicates the frequency of recombination (

1998). The

homoplasy ratio varies between 0, indicating completely clonal descent by the accumulation of mutations and 1, indicating free recombination where all sequence
polymorphisms are found repeatedly in independent sequences that are in dierent branches of a maximal parsimony tree (apparent homoplasies). The homoplasy
ratio (H) for the seven sequenced housekeeping genes ranged from 0.53 to 0.75 (geometric Mean 0.59), indicating free recombination (table:3.5). These ndings were
slightly lower than those previously reported (

3.2. Phylogenetic Analysis

46

3.2.1 Structure Analysis
The number of bacterial populations, K, was determined using the program STRUCTURE 2.0 under the "no admixture" model by comparing posterior probabilities of
multiple STRUCTURE runs for multiple runs where 2 < K < 15 and examining
the isolates that were assigned to each population. In each run, a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation of 25,000 iterations approximated the posterior
probability of K, following a burn-in of 10,000 iterations. The posterior probability
of K was highest between 4 < K < 10; but strain assignment for K > 6 either split
existing populations inconsistently or produced hypothetical populations to which
no isolates were assigned. Analysis using another clustering algorithm model (expectation maximization), implemented in fastruct, also partitioned the total data into
ve populations. Within the 5 ancestral populations determined by STRUCTURE,
the Sudanese strains clustered along with the Ethiopian strains, the Nigerian strains,
and the European strains.
The linkage model of STRUCTURE incorporates linkage disequilibrium due to
correlations in ancestry between loci that reect admixture between populations

Falush et al., 2003a).

(

The linkage model is a more accurate model of the data than

the no-admixture model, giving a higher model probability for K=5 populations
with the global data set (however, because it is nucleotide based, it does not assign
individual isolates to populations). We chose K=5 for analysis involving the linkage
model because this number of populations yielded highly reproducible runs with this
model.
Matrices of pairwise FST (a measure of genetic dierentiation between populations) between paired groups of samples from similar geographic locations were
strongly correlated (Mantel regression coecient = 0.86, P<0.001) between microsatellite data and

H. pylori

sequences; with more than 70% of human variation

explained by a linear relationship with microbial variation.

Therefore, the geo-

graphic component of genetic diversity seems to be quantitatively comparable between

H. pylori

and humans, except that FST is considerably higher in H. pylori

Linz et al., 2007).

(

The ancestry of the Sudanese strains showed a very high proportion of ancestral

Europe 2 (AE2) in all strains. In addition, some strains, mostly those isolated from
western Sudan had a relatively higher proportion of ancestral Africa 1 than others
isolated in dierent parts of the country. Ancestral Europe 1, ancestral East Asia
and ancestral Africa 2 were virtually absent in almost all strains.

These results

indicate a very homogeneous population lacking diversity in ancestry, despite the
dierences in ethnic and linguistic origins of the subjects from whom the strains
were obtained.

H. pylori

strains isolated in Sudan belong to a single population. The attempts

to further divide this cluster into subpopulations failed. Upon modeling of two to
four subpopulations, the isolates repeatedly formed the same groups (in the case
of four subpopulations, one of them did not contain any strains).

Discussion
Recently, nonrecombining genetic loci, mtDNA, and the Y chromosome were used
to clarify the population history of our species. These studies, along with classical
studies of nuclear genes, supported the recent theory of an African origin of modern

humans (

It is thought that two haplogroups (L0

and L1) of human mtDNA and two (A and B) of the human Y chromosome represent
the ancestral human lineages, based on phylogenetic trees relating various worldwide
haplogroups (

Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman , 2003; Forster , 2004) (note that the forMishmar et al., 2003)).

mer paraphyletic L1 group split into haplogroups L0 and L1; (

The L0 and L1 haplogroups occur mainly in African hunter-gatherers (

Watson et al.,

1997). Haplogroup A is frequent in eastern and southern Africa, while haplogroup
B is spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa (

Hammer et al., 2001).

These ancestral

haplogroups of mtDNA and the Y chromosome are now a minority, and instead the
L2 and L3 haplogroups of mtDNA and the E haplogroup of the Y chromosome are

2004).

Language is a useful basis for classication of African peoples.

The ma-

jor linguistic families of Africa are Afroasiatic, Niger-Kordofanian (including NigerCongo), Nilo-Saharan, and Khoisan (

Greenberg ,

1966).

Niger-Kordofanian, Nilo-

Saharan, and Khoisan are spoken exclusively in Africa, while Afroasiatic languages
are also spoken in the Middle East. Languages of the Khoisan family are spoken

by hunter-gatherers in southwestern most parts of the continent. The present-day
distribution of African languages would have been associated, at least partly, with
human dispersals within Africa.
Population genetic studies of the Sudan, using blood genetic markers, have shown
that the population comprises a broad spectrum of groups, ranging from endoge-

nous African groups to those of apparent semitic ancestry (

and el Seikh ,

1987).

MtDNA has shown that the Sudanese populations exhibit

a more African ancestry in the maternal lineage (

Krings et al.,

1999) and the Y-

chromosome has shown presence of haplogroups present only in Africans as well as

Underhill et al., 2000).

migration has been extensively studied (

Wirth et al.,

2004;

Devi et al.,

2006).

H. pylori

was shown to have a panmictic

population structure, and clones are rare or absent (

et al.,

Achtman et al., 1999; Suerbaum

1998). Previous population genetic studies have shown the existence of an-

cestral population types or strains that are consistent with geographic regions. The
presence of strains specic to geographic locales, each with an ancestral origin that
can be geographically determined, provides an independent marker from that of Ychromosome, microsatellite or mitochondrial DNA studies, for deciphering human
history.

Comparisons of these markers show that DNA sequences from

H. pylori

provide greater resolution, for example, in the separation of close population groups
of Muslims and Budhists in Ladakh. We have attempted to utilise this for the study
of the very interesting and diverse population of Sudan.
The population of the Sudan comprises many endogenous tribes, about 572 different tribes speaking over one hundred languages. 40% of the population of thirty
four million (2001 census) claim membership of Arabic groups. About 50% of the
population speak Arabic, 23 % Nilotic and Nilo-Hamitic languages and 11% Sudanic
and Darfurian languages. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Sudan has been
the home of man throughout pre-historic and historic times.

The Sudan has an

old civilization - the Merites in 300 B.C. already had their own system of writing.
Christianity introduced in 540 A.D. has also played a great role in cultural and social
life of the Sudanese. Muslim penetration started in the 14th century A.D. followed
by occupation by Turkish and Egyptian forces in the early 19th century. In spite of
these external inuences, the people of the Sudan retained their own tribal practices,
languages, endogamy and consanguinity; and hence diversity in

Helicobacter pylori

was expected.
We used an expanded data set (598

H. pylori

isolates) to test whether patterns

in their distribution mimic those of the local populations. The same ve ancestral
sources of nucleotides as found previously with a smaller data set (

Falush et al.,

2003b) have been identied using Bayesian MCMC (Monte-Carlo Markov chain)
cluster analysis. These analyses also assigned the isolates to ve populations containing various degrees of ancestry from the ve ancestral sources.

Four of the

populations had been previously identied, and designated hpEurope, hpEastAsia, hpAfrica1 and hpAfrica2 owing to their obvious geographical associations. In
agreement, almost all strains isolated from Europeans belong to hpEurope, and
most isolates from east Asia belong to hpEastAsia. The results also conrmed that
hpAfrica2, previously represented by only few isolates, is common in South Africa.
A new population was identied and designated hpNEAfrica. hpNEAfrica was predominant among isolates from Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Nilo-Saharan speakers
in northern Nigeria.
These ndings are in agreement with a recent study by Linz et. al., who identied
six populations, using a data set of 769

H. pylori

isolates. In addition to identifying

the hpNEAfrica group, they have also identied another population, hpAsia2 which
were isolated in northern India, Bangladesh, Thailand and the Philipines.

As in

humans, they observed a continuous loss of genetic diversity with increasing geographic distance from east Africa, supporting the recent out of Africa origin model.
Their simulations have predicted that

the same time scale as anatomically modern humans (
Our ndings have indicated a lack of diversity in

Helicobacter pylori

strains iso-

lated from dierent ethnic groups in Sudan. The fact that nucleotide diversity in

Chapter 4. Discussion

56

Sudan is comparable with that found elsewhere shows that (as well as the mutation rate not being exceptional) that there is a population of bacteria present and
not just a clone.

The isolates indicated a common ancestral origin for all of the

studied groups. The previously described human diversity was not apparent in the

H. pylori

isolates studied.

The closest isolates to the Sudanese were found to be

from Ethiopian isolates. The geographic distance between both groups is very close.
Despite this, we were able to dierentiate between both groups, as each group has
clustered seperately. Of the 71 sequenced isolates, we were unable to dierentiate
between the ethnic groups; despite distinct phenotypic and linguistic dierences. In
an attempt to explain these ndings, we suggest the following.

Matrilocality and a male driven migration pattern
into Sudan
The majority of migrants into Sudan have been soldiers or merchants, occupations
mainly of males.

Those who have settled intermarried with local groups.

The

largest and most eminent migrant group has been that of the Arabs, whose most
signicant exodus was in 614 A.D. The inheritance modality in the region at the
time was matrilenial, and migrant Arabs have gained positions of power by marriage
with the local tribes. Arabic later followed to become the language of the elite and
progressed to become the lingua franca. As ethnic identication follows a patrilineal
pattern, the tribes described themselves as being of Arab origin.

As

since a large population of west Africans (both males and females) have settled
Sudan during the last 4 centuries, en route to pilgrimage to Mecca.

The west

Africans currently form 30% of the population and still retain their ethnic identity,

support of this modality are the mtDNA studies (

Salas et al.,

2002;

Also in

Krings et al.,

Chapter 4. Discussion

57

1999), which indicate that mtDNA studied in Sudan falls within African types and is
similar to that found in neighbouring east African countries. As expected one also
nds a higher diversity of Y-chromosome in Sudan, and haplotypes representing
various African and Semitic origins are found. The autosomal DNA markers show
a great degree of variance and indicates admixture between the groups, although
some have retained their aboriginal identity.

Rapid circulation
Another explanation for the lack of diversity in ancestry could be explained by the
rapid circulation of a certain strain. Recent research has shown that

H. pylori

is

not necessarily transmitted vertically and evidence of horizontal transmission has
been found in family studies in Africa (unpublished data, Suerbaum and Schwarz).

Helicobacter pylori

has been also identied in dierent settings in the environment,

including vomitus, faeces, water and domestic animals, and a low socioeconomic status. All of these factors are present in Sudan and hence the circulation of a dominant
strain is also possible and would explain this apparent lack of diversity. One would
expect to nd similar homogeneity in countries with diverse populations and poor
socioeconomic conditions, which is not the case, for isolates from India and Latin
America had dierent ancestral composition according to the ethnic group divisions
, i.e.

it was possible to dierentiate Amerinds from European migrants in Latin

America. The only explanation would be if local factors specic to Sudan favour
this circulation, and a suggested modality is via sheep, as the Sudanese are known

to be further examined.

Chapter 5
Conclusion
This study further supports the suitablity of

H. pylori

as a marker for population

genetics, and is a useful marker for the study of female lineages.

The previous

division of the ancestral groups into Ancestral Africa 1, Ancestral Africa 2, Ancestral
Europe 1, Ancestral Europe 2, and Ancestral East Asia is inaccurate, as we have
identied that Ancestral Europe 2 (a misnomer) is in fact Ancestral East Africa;
and this in turn supports that the rst human migrants out of Africa have left from
East Africa, as this is the only ancestral population commonly found outside Africa.
Despite the diversity of the Sudanese population, they seem to share a common
ancestral

Helicobacter pylori

population, indicating that migration into Sudan has

been male dominant. Further studies are necessary to conrm the lack of diveristy
within the isolates from Sudan.
